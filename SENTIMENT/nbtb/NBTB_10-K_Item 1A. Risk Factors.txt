Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Asset/Liability Management

The Company attempts to maximize net interest income and net income, while actively managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity through the mix of various core deposit products and
              other sources of funds, which in turn fund an appropriate mix of earning assets. The changes in the Company’s asset mix and sources of funds, and the resulting impact on net interest income, on an FTE basis, are discussed below. The following
              table includes the condensed consolidated average balance sheet, an analysis of interest income/expense and average yield/rate for each major category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a taxable equivalent basis.

2024 OPERATING RESULTS AS COMPARED TO 2023 OPERATING RESULTS

Net Interest Income

Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $400.1 million, up $21.9 million, or 5.8%, from 2023. 
FTE 
NIM was 3.23% for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of 6 bps from 2023. Interest income increased $88.9 million, or 17.0%, as the yield on average interest-earning assets
                increased 39 bps from 2023 to 4.93%, while average interest-earning assets of $12.45 billion increased $878.8 million primarily due to the Salisbury acquisition and organic loan growth, partially offset by a decrease in securities. Interest
                expense was up $67.0 million, or 46.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 80 bps to 2.36% and a $1.22 billion increase in
                interest-bearing deposits as a result of the Salisbury acquisition, partly offset by a decrease of $346.4 million in the average balances of short-term borrowings and the 548 bps rate paid on those borrowings. Included in net interest
                income was $10.4 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of acquisition-related net accretion.

Loans and Corresponding Interest and Fees on Loans

The average balance of loans increased by approximately $1.01 billion, or 11.5%, from 2023 to 2024 driven by the Salisbury acquisition and organic loan growth, with increases in C&I,
              CRE, indirect auto and residential mortgage portfolios being partially offset by a reduction in the average balance of residential solar and other consumer loans. The yield on average loans increased from 5.26% in 2023 to 5.64% in 2024, as
              loans re-priced upward due to the interest rate environment in 2024. FTE interest income from loans increased 19.5%, from $463.3 million in 2023 to $553.8 million in 2024. This increase was due to the increases in yields and an increase in
              the average balance.

Table of Contents

Loans in the C&I and CRE portfolios consist primarily of loans extended to small and medium-sized entities. The Company offers a variety of
              loan products tailored to meet the needs of commercial customers including term loans, time notes and lines of credit. Such loans are made available to businesses for working capital needs such as inventory and receivables, business
              expansion, equipment purchases, livestock purchases and seasonal crop expenses. These loans are typically collateralized by business assets such as equipment, accounts receivable and perishable agricultural products, which are inherently
              subject to industry price volatility. The Company extends CRE loans to support real estate transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings, expansions and property improvements to both commercial and agricultural properties. These loans
              are secured by liens on real estate assets, covering a spectrum of properties including apartments, commercial structures, healthcare facilities and others, whether occupied by owners or non-owners. Risks associated with the CRE portfolio
              pertain to the borrowers’ ability to meet interest and principal payments over the life of the loan, as well as their ability to secure financing upon the loan’s maturity. The Company has a risk management framework that includes rigorous
              underwriting standards, targeted portfolio stress testing, interest rate sensitivities on commercial borrowers and comprehensive credit risk monitoring mechanisms. The Company remains vigilant in monitoring market trends, economic indicators
              and regulatory developments to promptly adapt our risk management strategies as needed.

Within the CRE portfolio, approximately 81% comprises Non-Owner Occupied CRE, with the remaining 19% being Owner-Occupied CRE. Non-Owner Occupied CRE includes diverse sectors across the
              Company’s markets such as residential rental properties (43%) and office spaces (18%), along with retail, manufacturing, mixed use, hotels and others. Notably, office CRE loans account for 6% of the total outstanding loans, predominantly
              serving suburban medical and professional tenants across suburban and small urban markets. These loans carry an average size of $1.9 million, with 9% maturing over the next two years. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total
              CRE construction and development loans amounted to $314.8 million and $347.2 million, respectively.

Residential real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by a first or second mortgage on primary residences. The Company originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate,
              one-to-four-family residential loans for the construction or purchase of a residential property or refinancing of a mortgage. These loans are collateralized by properties located in the Company’s market area. The Company has never actively
              participated in subprime mortgage lending, which has historically been one of the riskiest sectors in the residential housing market. Given the absence of a universally accepted definition of what constitutes “subprime” lending, the Company
              follows guidance from the Office of Thrift Supervision and other federal bank regulators (the “Agencies”), as outlined in the “Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs,” or the Expanded Guidance, issued by the Agencies by press release
              dated January 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2024, there were $40.5 million in residential construction and development loans included in total loans.

The Company participated in the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a guaranteed, forgivable loan program created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and
              Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and the Consolidated Appropriation Act targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the SBA, the guarantee
              is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. PPP covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain
              workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are satisfied. The SBA will reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven, and PPP lenders
              will not be held liable for any representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. Lenders receive pre-determined fees for processing and servicing PPP loans. In addition, PPP loans are risk-weighted
              at zero percent under the generally applicable Standardized Approach used to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes.

In 2017, the Company partnered with Sungage Financial, LLC. to offer financing to consumers for solar ownership with the program tailored for delivery through solar installers. Advances of
              credit through this business line are to prime borrowers and are subject to the Company’s underwriting standards. Typically, the Company collects fees at origination that are deferred and recognized into interest income over the estimated
              life of the loan. Residential solar loans are in a planned-run off status.

The Company offers a variety of consumer loan products including indirect auto, home equity and other consumer loans. Indirect auto loans include indirect installment loans to individuals, which
              are primarily secured by automobiles. Although automobile loans have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Company’s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Other
              consumer loans consist of direct installment loans to individuals most secured by automobiles and other personal property and unsecured consumer loans across a national footprint originated through our relationship with national
              technology-driven consumer lending companies that began over 10 years ago beginning with our investment in Springstone Financial LLC (“Springstone”) which was subsequently acquired by LendingClub in 2014. Springstone and LendingClub loans are
              in a planned run-off status. In addition to installment loans, the Company also offers personal lines of credit, overdraft protection, home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans (loans secured by a lien position on one-to-four
              family residential real estate) to finance home improvements, debt consolidation, education and other uses. For home equity loans, consumers are able to borrow up to 85% of the equity in their homes, and are generally tied to Prime with a ten
              year draw followed by a fifteen year amortization.

Loans by Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity

The following table presents the maturity distribution and an analysis of loans that have predetermined and floating interest rates. Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in
              which the contractual maturity is due. For loans without contractual maturities, classification of maturity is consistent with the policy elections to measure the allowance for credit losses. Specifically, C&I and CRE lines of credit
              assume one year maturity for relationships over $1.0 million and five year maturity for relationships under $1.0 million, while home equity line of credits maturities are classified based on their fixed rate conversion date plus five years.
              C&I includes PPP and other consumer includes home equity and other consumer loans.

Table of Contents

The following tables set forth information with regard to contractual maturities of debt securities shown in amortized cost ($) and weighted average yield (%) at December 31, 2024.
              Weighted-average yields are an arithmetic computation of income (not FTE adjusted) divided by amortized cost. Maturities of mortgage-backed, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities are stated based on their estimated
              average lives. Actual maturities may differ from estimated average lives or contractual maturities because, in certain cases, borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Funding Sources and Corresponding Interest Expense

The Company utilizes traditional deposit products such as time, savings, NOW, money market and demand deposits as its primary source for funding. Other sources, such as short-term FHLB advances,
              federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered time deposits and long-term FHLB borrowings are utilized as necessary to support the Company’s growth in assets and to achieve interest rate sensitivity
              objectives. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities totaled $8.38 billion in 2024 and increased $906.1 million from 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the interest-bearing deposits acquired from Salisbury partially offset
              by a decrease in short-term borrowings. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 1.93% in 2023 to 2.52% in 2024. This increase in rates caused an increase in interest expense of $67.0 million, or 46.3%, from $144.6 million
              in 2023 to $211.5 million in 2024.

Deposits

Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.22 billion, or 18.2%, from 2023 to 2024. Average money market deposits increased $890.0
                  million, or 36.8%, during 2024 compared to 2023. Average NOW accounts increased $62.0 million, or 4.0%, during 2024 as compared to 2023. The average balance of savings accounts decreased $135.2 million, or 7.9%, during 2024 compared to
                  2023. The average balance of time deposits increased $401.5 million, or 39.9%, from 2023 to 2024. The average balance of demand deposits decreased $86.3 million, or 2.5%, during 2024 compared to 2023. The Company continues to experience
                  some migration 
incremental 
from 
noninterest bearing
 and low interest checking and savings
                  accounts into higher cost money market and time deposit instruments. The increase in average balances was primarily due to the $1.31 billion in deposits acquired from Salisbury in the third quarter of 2023. The Company’s composition of
                  total deposits is diverse and granular with over 561,000 accounts with an average per account balance of $20,574 as of December 31, 2024.

The rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits was up 80 bps to 2.36% for 2024. The rate paid for MMDA increased 96 bps to 3.54% from 2023 to 2024. The rate paid for NOW deposit accounts increased from 0.53% in 2023 to 0.83% in 2024.
              The rate paid for savings deposits increased from 0.04% in 2023 to 0.05% in 2024. The rate paid for time deposits increased from 3.30% during 2023 to 3.96% during 2024.

Borrowings

Average federal funds purchased decreased to $13.0 million in 2024. The rate paid on federal funds purchased was 5.54% in 2024. Average repurchase agreements increased to $95.9 million in 2024
              from $70.3 million in 2023. The average rate paid on repurchase agreements increased from 1.06% in 2023 to 2.35% in 2024. Average short-term borrowings decreased to $104.0 million in 2024 from $450.4 million in 2023. The average rate paid on
              short-term borrowings increased from 5.24% in 2023 to 5.48% in 2024. Average long-term debt increased from $24.2 million in 2023 to $29.7 million in 2024. The average balance of junior subordinated debt remained at $101.2 million in 2024. The
              average rate paid for junior subordinated debt in 2024 was 7.44%, up from 7.23% in 2023.

Total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, which generally represent overnight borrowing transactions and other short-term
              borrowings, primarily FHLB advances, with original maturities of one year or less. The Company has unused lines of credit with the FHLB and access to brokered deposits available for short-term financing. Those sources totaled approximately
              $3.46 billion and $2.87 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Securities collateralizing repurchase agreements are held in safekeeping by nonaffiliated financial institutions and are under the Company’s control. Long-term debt,
              which is comprised primarily of FHLB advances, are collateralized by the FHLB stock owned by the Company, certain of its mortgage-backed securities and a blanket lien on its residential real estate mortgage loans.

On June 23, 2020, the Company issued $100.0 million of 5.00% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital, bear interest at an
              annual rate of 5.00%, payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on January 1, 2021, and a floating rate of interest equivalent to the three-month SOFR plus a spread of 4.85%, payable quarterly in arrears commencing on October 1, 2025. The
              subordinated debt issuance cost of $2.2 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis into interest expense over five years. The Company repurchased $2.0 million of the subordinated notes in 2022 at a discount of $0.1 million.

Subordinated notes assumed in connection with the Salisbury acquisition included $25.0 million of 3.50% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031. The subordinated notes, which
                  qualify as Tier 2 capital, bear interest at an annual rate of 3.50%, payable quarterly in arrears commencing on June 30, 2021, and a floating rate of interest equivalent to the three-month SOFR plus a spread of 2.80%, payable quarterly in
                  arrears commencing on June 30, 2026. As of the acquisition date, the fair value discount was $3.0 million, which will be amortized into interest expense over the expected call or maturity date.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the subordinated debt net of unamortized issuance costs and fair value discount was $121.2 million and $119.7 million, respectively.

              retirement plan administration fees and wealth management fees. The increase in retirement plan administration fees was driven by higher market level, the acquisition of Retirement Direct, LLC and PACO, Inc., organic growth and higher
              activity-based fees. The increase in wealth management fees was driven by the addition of Salisbury revenues, organic growth and market performance.

Income Taxes

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent
              year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the fourth quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions.

The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject at times to ongoing audits by U.S. federal and state tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Future results may include
              favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are proposed or resolved or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate may
              fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.

On August 16, 2022, H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), was signed into law. The IRA, among other things, introduced a corporate
            alternative minimum tax, excise tax on stock repurchases and a clean vehicle credit. The Company has evaluated the impact of the IRA and does not expect it to be material. However, the Company will continue to monitor any future implication on
            its tax position and business operations.

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $38.8 million, up $4.1 million, or 11.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2023. The effective tax rate
            was 21.6% in 2024 and was 22.6% in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2023 was due to a higher level of tax-exempt income as a percentage of total taxable income.

Risk Management – Credit Risk

Credit risk is managed through a network of loan officers, credit committees, loan policies and oversight from senior credit officers and the
              Board. Management follows a policy of continually identifying, analyzing and grading credit risk inherent in each loan portfolio. An ongoing independent review of individual credits in the commercial loan portfolio is performed by the
              independent loan review function. These components of the Company’s underwriting and monitoring functions are critical to the timely identification, classification and resolution of problem credits.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02 
Financial Instruments - CECL Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage
                Disclosures 
(“ASU 2022-02”), which resulted in an insignificant change to the Company’s methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses on TDRs since December 31, 2022. The January 1, 2023 decrease in allowance for credit
              loss on TDR loans relating to adoption of ASU 2022-02 was $0.6 million, which increased retained earnings by $0.5 million and decreased the deferred tax asset by $0.1 million.

Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical estimate given the degree of judgment exercised in evaluating the level of the allowance
              required to estimate expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the consolidated results of operations.

The CECL methodology requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of a loan (or pool of loans). The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from,
              or added to, the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net, lifetime amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes a loan balance is confirmed to be
              uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.

Required additions or reductions to the allowance for credit losses are made periodically by charges or credits to the provision for loan
                  losses. These are necessary to maintain the allowance at a level which management believes is reasonably reflective of the overall loss expected over the contractual life of the loan portfolio, adjusted for expected prepayments and
                  curtailments. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, additions or reductions to the allowance may fluctuate from one reporting period to another. These fluctuations are reflective of changes in risk
                  associated with portfolio content and/or changes in management’s assessment of any or all of the determining factors discussed above. Management considers the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate based on evaluation and analysis
                  of the loan portfolio.

Management estimates the allowance balance for credit losses using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable
              and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Company historical loss experience was supplemented with peer information when there was insufficient loss data for
              the Company. Significant management judgment is required at each point in the measurement process.

Table of Contents

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis, with both a quantitative and qualitative analysis that is
                      applied on a quarterly basis, when similar risk characteristics exist. The respective quantitative allowance for each segment is measured using an econometric, discounted PD and LGD modeling methodology in which distinct,
                      segment-specific multi-variate regression models are applied to multiple, probabilistically weighted external economic forecasts. Under the discounted cash flows methodology, expected credit losses are estimated over the effective
                      life of the loans by measuring the difference between the net present value of modeled cash flows and amortized cost basis. After quantitative considerations, management applies additional qualitative adjustments so that the allowance
                      for credit loss is reflective of the estimate of lifetime losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.

Portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, management
              revised the manner in which loans were pooled for similar risk characteristics. Management developed segments for estimating loss based on type of borrower and collateral which is generally based upon federal call report segmentation and have
              been combined or subsegmented as needed to ensure loans of similar risk profiles are appropriately pooled.

Additional information about our Allowance for Credit Losses is included in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements as well as in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of
              the Management Discussion and Analysis. The Company’s management considers the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate based on evaluation and analysis of the loan portfolio.

The allowance for credit losses totaled $116.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $114.4 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 1.16%
              at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.19% at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to providing for organic loan growth, the slowing of prepayment speed
              assumptions, including the changes in prepayment model assumptions. These increases to the allowance for credit losses were partially offset by a change in forecast scenario weightings from 70% baseline and 30% downside to 80% baseline and
              20% downside, and the shift in loan composition driven by other consumer and residential solar portfolios that are in a planned run-off status.

The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 incorporates the recording of $14.5 million of allowance for acquired Salisbury loans as of the acquisition date, which included both the
              $8.8 million of non-PCD allowance recognized through the provision for loan losses and the $5.8 million of PCD allowance reclassified from loans.

The allowance for credit losses was 224.73% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2024 as compared to 302.05% at December 31, 2023. The
                  allowance for credit losses was 253.17% of nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2024 as compared to 334.38% at December 31, 2023. The decline in the coverage of the allowance to nonperforming and nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2023 to
                  December 31, 2024 largely relates to one nonperforming relationship with an amortized cost basis of $14.0 million that is individually evaluated for purposes of the allowance for credit losses which had no reserve established at December
                  31, 2024.

The provision for loan losses was $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Provision expense decreased from the prior
            year primarily due to the $8.8 million of acquisition-related provision for loan losses due to the Salisbury acquisition recorded in 2023, providing for current year loan growth, the slowing of prepayment speed assumptions in the current year,
            changes in model assumptions including the extension of the expected duration of the portfolio. Net charge-offs totaled $18.0 million for 2024, up from $16.8 million in 2023. Net charge-offs to average loans was 18 bps for 2024 compared to 19
            bps for 2023.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, troubled loans modifications, OREO and
                  nonperforming securities. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest payments become 90 days past due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans may also be placed on nonaccrual when
                  circumstances indicate that the borrower may be unable to meet the contractual principal or interest payments. The threshold for evaluating classified commercial and CRE loans risk graded substandard or doubtful, and nonperforming loans
                  individually evaluated for credit loss is $1.0 million. OREO represents property acquired through foreclosure and is valued at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less any estimated disposal costs.

Total nonperforming assets were $51.8 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $37.9 million at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans at
                  December 31, 2024 were $51.6 million or 0.52% of total loans, compared with $37.9 million or 0.39% of total loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets 
from

                    the same period in the prior year 
was attributable to a CRE relationship that was placed into a nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2024. The relationship is being actively managed 
and was written down to estimated fair value in the fourth quarter of 2024, and as such, no specific reserve has been established.
 Total nonaccrual loans were $45.8 million or 0.46% of total loans
                  at December 31, 2024, compared to $34.2 million or 0.35% of total loans at December 31, 2023. Past due loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.34% at December 31, 2024, up from 0.32% of total loans at December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents

In addition to nonperforming loans discussed above, the Company has also identified approximately $116.1 million in potential problem loans at
                December 31, 2024 as compared to $87.7 million at December 31, 2023. Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing, with a possibility of loss if weaknesses are not corrected. Such loans may need to be disclosed as
                nonperforming at some time in the future. Potential problem loans are classified by the Company’s loan rating system as “substandard.” 
Potential problem loans have increased to
                  more normalized levels and the increase primarily relates to a few CRE relationships reflecting changing conditions in certain CRE markets including construction delays, rising costs and delays in leasing up spaces. 
The increase in
                potential problem loans from December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the net migration of $41.9 million to substandard, partially offset by an increase of $10.0 million in nonaccrual commercial loan balances. Management cannot predict the
                extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors, which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that other loans will not become over 90 days past due, be placed on
                nonaccrual, become troubled loans modifications or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses. To mitigate this risk the Company maintains a diversified loan portfolio, has no significant concentration in any
                particular industry and originates loans primarily within its footprint.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures

The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company has exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is
              unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as an expense in other noninterest expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur
              and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated lives. The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments totaled $4.4 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $5.1 million as of December
              31, 2023. December 31, 2023 included $0.8 million of acquisition-related provision for unfunded loan commitments.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternate funding sources. The
              objective of liquidity management is to ensure the Company can fund balance sheet growth, meet the cash flow requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet
              their credit needs. Management’s ALCO is responsible for liquidity management and has developed guidelines, which cover all assets and liabilities, as well as off-balance sheet items that are potential sources or uses of liquidity. Liquidity
              policies must also provide the flexibility to implement appropriate strategies, along with regular monitoring of liquidity and testing of the contingent liquidity plan. Requirements change as loans grow, deposits and securities mature and
              payments on borrowings are made. Liquidity management includes a focus on interest rate sensitivity management with a goal of avoiding widely fluctuating net interest margins through periods of changing economic conditions. Loan repayments
              and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, the
              housing market, general and local economic conditions, and competition in the marketplace. Management continually monitors marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset
              prepayments.

The primary liquidity measurement the Company utilizes is called “Basic Surplus,” which captures the adequacy of its access to reliable sources of cash relative to the stability of its funding
              mix of average liabilities. This approach recognizes the importance of balancing levels of cash flow liquidity from short and long-term securities with the availability of dependable borrowing sources, which can be accessed when necessary. At
              December 31, 2024, the Company’s Basic Surplus measurement was 17.0% of total assets, or $2.34 billion, as compared to the December 31, 2023 Basic Surplus of 11.6%, or $1.54 billion, and was above the Company’s minimum of 5% (calculated at
              $689.3 million and $665.5 million, of period end total assets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) set forth in its liquidity policies.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, FHLB advances outstanding totaled $45.6 million and $322.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had $199.0 million and $77.0 million,
              respectively, of collateral encumbered by municipal letters of credit. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system and had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of approximately $1.71 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.11 billion at
              December 31, 2023. In addition, unpledged securities could have been used to increase borrowing capacity at the FHLB by an additional $957.3 million and $823.3 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or used to collateralize
              other borrowings, such as repurchase agreements. The Company also has the ability to issue brokered time deposits and to borrow against established borrowing facilities with other banks (federal funds), which could provide additional
              liquidity of $2.01 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition, the Bank has a “Borrower-in-Custody” program with the FRB with the addition of the ability to pledge automobile and residential solar loans as collateral. At
              December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had the capacity to borrow $1.13 billion and $1.02 billion, respectively, from this program. The Company’s internal policies authorize borrowing up to 25% of assets. Under this policy, remaining available
              borrowing capacity totaled $3.38 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.99 billion at December 31, 2023.

This Basic Surplus approach enables the Company to appropriately manage liquidity from both operational and contingency perspectives. By
                  tempering the need for cash flow liquidity with reliable borrowing facilities, the Company is able to operate with a more fully invested and, therefore, higher interest income generating securities portfolio. The makeup and term structure
                  of the securities portfolio is, in part, impacted by the overall interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet. Investment decisions and deposit pricing strategies are impacted by the liquidity position. The Company considers its Basic
                  Surplus position to be strong. However, certain events may adversely impact the Company’s liquidity position in 2025. 
While short-term interest rates have declined, they
                    remain elevated relative to recent history, which could result in deposit declines as depositors have alternative opportunities for yield on their excess funds.
 In the current economic environment, draws against lines of credit
                  could drive asset growth higher. Disruptions in wholesale funding markets could spark increased competition for deposits. These scenarios could lead to a decrease in the Company’s Basic Surplus measure below the minimum policy level of
                  5%. Note, enhanced liquidity monitoring was put in place to quickly respond to the changing environment during the pandemic including increasing the frequency of monitoring and adding additional sources of liquidity. While the pandemic
                  has come to an end, this enhanced monitoring continues as elevated interest rates and the recent bank failures have led to a deposit decline in the banking system and increased volatility to liquidity risk.

At December 31, 2024, a portion of the Company’s loans and securities were pledged as collateral on borrowings. Therefore, once on-balance sheet liquidity is reduced, future growth of earning
              assets will depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain additional funding, through growth of core deposits and collateral management and may require further use of brokered time deposits or other higher cost borrowing arrangements.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $188.6 million and $157.5 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The critical elements of net operating cash flows include net income,
              adjusted for non-cash income and expense items such as the provision for loan losses, deferred income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and cash flows generated through changes in other assets and liabilities.

Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $399.2 million and $44.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Critical elements of investing activities are loan and investment securities
              transactions.

Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $289.5 million and net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $105.4 million
                in 2024 and 2023. The critical elements of financing activities are proceeds from deposits, borrowings and stock issuance. In addition, financing activities are impacted by dividends and treasury stock transactions.

Commitments to Extend Credit

The Company makes contractual commitments to extend credit, which include unused lines of credit, which are subject to the Company’s credit approval and monitoring procedures. At December
              31, 2024 and 2023, commitments to extend credit in the form of loans, including unused lines of credit, amounted to $2.84 billion and $2.68 billion, respectively. In the opinion of management, there are no material commitments to extend
              credit, including unused lines of credit that represent unusual risks. All commitments to extend credit in the form of loans, including unused lines of credit, expire within one year.

Standby Letters of Credit

The Company does not issue any guarantees that would require liability-recognition or disclosure, other than its standby letters of credit. The Company guarantees the obligations or performance
              of customers by issuing standby letters of credit to third-parties. These standby letters of credit are generally issued in support of third-party debt, such as corporate debt issuances, industrial revenue bonds and municipal securities. The
              risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers and letters of credit are subject to the same credit origination, portfolio maintenance and
              management procedures in effect to monitor other credit and off-balance sheet products. Typically, these instruments have one-year expirations terms with an option to renew upon annual review; therefore, the total amounts do not necessarily
              represent future cash requirements. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, standby letters of credit were $50.8 million and $44.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company’s standby letters of credit was
              not significant. The following table sets forth the commitment expiration period for standby letters of credit at:

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company records all derivatives at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative,
            whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and
            qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. The Company may enter into derivative
            contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even if hedge accounting does not apply or if the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value
            of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings.

When the Company purchases or sells a portion of a commercial loan that has an existing interest rate swap, it may enter into a risk
                      participation agreement to provide credit protection to the financial institution that originated the swap transaction should the borrower fail to perform on its obligation. The Company enters into both risk participation agreements
                      in which it purchases credit protection from other financial institutions and those in which it provides credit protection to other financial institutions. Any fee paid to the Company under a risk participation agreement is in
                      consideration of the credit risk of the counterparties and is recognized in the income statement. Credit risk on the risk participation agreements is determined after considering the risk rating, PD and LGD of the counterparties.

Loans Serviced for Others and Loans Sold with Recourse

The total amount of loans serviced by the Company for unrelated third parties was approximately $982.5 million and $856.9 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31,
              2024 and 2023, the Company had $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of mortgage servicing rights. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company serviced $24.7 million and $26.4 million, respectively, of agricultural loans sold with
              recourse. Due to sufficient collateral on these loans and government guarantees, no reserve is considered necessary at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Capital Resources

Consistent with its goal to operate a sound and profitable financial institution, the Company actively seeks to maintain a “well-capitalized” institution in accordance with regulatory standards.
              The principal source of capital to the Company is earnings retention. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital measurements are in excess of both regulatory minimum guidelines and meet the requirements to be considered well-capitalized.

The Company’s primary source of funds is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various laws and regulations restrict the ability of banks to pay dividends to their stockholders. Generally, the
              payment of dividends by the Company in the future as well as the payment of interest on the capital securities will require the generation of sufficient future earnings by its subsidiaries.

Certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends. The approval of the OCC is required to pay dividends when a bank
              fails to meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards or when such dividends are in excess of a subsidiary bank’s earnings retained in the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years as specified in applicable OCC
              regulations. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $107.6 million and $106.6 million, respectively, of the total stockholders’ equity of the Bank was available for payment of dividends to the Company without approval by the OCC. The
              Bank’s ability to pay dividends also is subject to the Bank being in compliance with regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is currently in compliance with these requirements. Under the State of Delaware General Corporation Law, the
              Company may declare and pay dividends either out of accumulated net retained earnings or capital surplus.

Stock Repurchase Plan

The Company purchased 7,600 shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024 at an average price of $33.02 per share under
                its previously announced share repurchase program. The Company may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time to mitigate the potential dilutive effect of stock-based incentive plans and other potential uses of common stock for
                corporate purposes. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there were 1,992,400 shares available for repurchase under this plan 
authorized on December 18, 2023, 
which is set to expire on December 31, 2025.

ITEM 7A. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the Company. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in
                the normal course of the Company’s business activities or are immaterial to the results of operations.

Interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to
                interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than earning assets in a given period, a
                significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease
                in net interest income.

To manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, management monitors the Company’s interest rate risk. Management’s ALCO meets
                monthly to review the Company’s interest rate risk position and profitability and to recommend strategies for consideration by the Board. Management also reviews loan and deposit pricing and the Company’s securities portfolio, formulates
                investment and funding strategies and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the Board’s objectives in the most effective manner. Notwithstanding the Company’s interest rate risk management
                activities, the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income.

In managing the Company’s asset/liability position, the Board and management aim to manage the Company’s interest rate risk while minimizing
                NIM compression. At times, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the Board and management may determine to increase the
                Company’s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its NIM. The Company’s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the difference between long and
                short-term interest rates.

The primary tool utilized by the ALCO to manage interest rate risk is earnings at risk modeling (interest rate sensitivity analysis). Information, such as principal balance, interest rate,
                maturity date, cash flows, next repricing date (if needed) and current rates are uploaded into the model to create an ending balance sheet. In addition, the ALCO makes certain assumptions regarding prepayment speeds for loans and mortgage
                related investment securities along with any optionality within the deposits and borrowings. The model is first run under an assumption of a flat rate scenario (e.g., no change in current interest rates) with a static balance sheet. Four
                additional models are run in which a gradual increase of 200 bps, a gradual increase of 100 bps, a gradual decrease of 100 bps and a gradual decrease of 200 bps takes place over a 12-month period with a static balance sheet. Under these
                scenarios, assets subject to prepayments are adjusted to account for faster or slower prepayment assumptions. Any investment securities or borrowings that have callable options embedded in them are handled accordingly based on the interest
                rate scenario. The resulting changes in net interest income are then measured against the flat rate scenario. The Company also runs other interest rate scenarios to highlight potential interest rate risk.

The 
Company’s Interest Rate Sensitivity has remained in a near neutral
                    position. In the declining rate scenario, net interest income is projected to modestly decrease when compared to the forecasted net interest income in the flat rate scenario through the simulation period. The decrease in net interest
                    income is a result of earning assets repricing and rolling over at lower yields at a faster pace than interest-bearing liabilities decline and/or reach their floors. In the rising rate scenarios, net interest income is near neutral,
                    impacted by slowing prepayments speeds and increased deposit reactivity; the magnitude of potential impact on earnings may be affected by the ability to lag deposit repricing on NOW, savings, MMDA and time accounts. Net interest income
                    for the next twelve months in the +200/+100/-100/-200 bp scenarios, as described above, is within the internal policy risk limits of not more than a 5.0% reduction in net interest income in the +100/-100 bps scenarios and of not more
                    than a 7.5% reduction in net interest income in the +200/-200 bps scenarios. The following table summarizes the percentage change in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios over a 12-month period from the
                    forecasted net interest income in the flat rate scenario using the
 December 31, 2024 balance sheet position:

The Company anticipates that the trajectory of net interest income will
                    continue to depend significantly on the timing and path of short to mid-term interest rates which are heavily influenced by inflationary pressures and FOMC monetary policy. In response to the economic impact of the pandemic, the federal
                    funds rate was reduced to near zero in March 2020, causing term interest rates to decline sharply across the yield curve. As a result, the Company lowered deposit rates. Post-pandemic, inflationary pressures have resulted in a higher
                    overall yield curve with federal funds increases of 425 bps in 2022 with an additional 100 bps of increases in 2023. However, the tightening cycle ended in September of 2024, when the FRB lowered the federal funds rate by 50 bps, with a
                    total of 100 bps of federal funds rate reductions by the end of 2024. While deposit rates increased meaningfully in 2023 and continued to increase in early 2024 in conjunction with elevated short-term interest rates, the recent federal
                    funds rate reduction has provided the catalyst for the Company to begin reducing deposit rates. The Company continues to focus on managing deposit expense in an environment of still elevated but declining short-term interest rates while
                    allowing assets to reprice upward in relation to existing portfolio asset yields

FINANCIAL
                  STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

NBT Bancorp Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NBT Bancorp Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income,
          comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the
          consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
          period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s
          internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued
          by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
          audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
          Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
          financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
          and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
          accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
          communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
          judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
          opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for credit losses – loans evaluated on a collective basis

As 
discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the
          Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans evaluated on a collective basis (the collective ACL on loans) was $116.0 million of a total allowance for credit losses of $116.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The collective ACL on loans includes
          the measure of expected credit losses on a collective (pooled) basis for class segments of loans that share similar risk characteristics. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology where the respective quantitative allowance for each
          segment is measured by comparing the amortized cost to the present value of expected principal, interest and recovery cash flows projected using an econometric, probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) modeling methodology. The
          Company uses PD regression models to develop the PD, and LGD models to develop the LGD, using historical credit loss experience over the observation period for both the Company and segment-specific selected peers. The application of these models
          incorporates multiple weighted external economic forecasts for the economic variables over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to long-term average economic
          variables over a reversion period on a straight-line basis. Contractual cash flows over the contractual life of the loans are the basis for expected principal, interest and recovery cash flows, adjusted for modeled defaults, expected prepayments
          and curtailments, and discounted at the loan-level effective interest rate. After quantitative considerations, the Company applies additional qualitative adjustments, giving consideration to the effects of limitations inherent in the quantitative
          model, so that the collective ACL on loans is reflective of the estimate of lifetime losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.

We identified the assessment of the collective ACL on loans as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills
          and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ACL on loans due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the collective ACL on
          loans methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate (1) the PD and LGD and their significant assumptions including the external economic forecasts and economic variables, and the related weighting of the forecasts, the reasonable
          and supportable forecast periods, the composition of the peer group, and the observation period from which historical Company and peer experience was used, (2) the expected prepayments and curtailments assumptions, and (3) the qualitative
          adjustments and the significant assumptions, including the effects of limitations inherent in the quantitative model. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD 
regression
 and LGD models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to
          the Company’s measurement of the collective ACL on loans estimate, including controls over the:

•

development of the collective ACL on loans methodology

•

continued use and appropriateness of the PD regression and LGD models

•

performance monitoring of the PD regression and LGD models

•

identification and determination of the expected prepayments and curtailments assumptions and the significant assumptions used in the PD regression and LGD models

•

development of the qualitative methodology and related adjustments, including the significant assumptions used in the measurement of select qualitative adjustments

•

analysis of the collective ACL on loans results, trends, and ratios.

We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ACL on loans estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance
          and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

•

evaluating the Company’s collective ACL on loans methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles

•

evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the performance monitoring of the PD regression and LGD models, by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable
                  industry and regulatory practices

•

assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD regression and LGD models, by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use

•

evaluating the expected prepayments and curtailments assumptions by comparing to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and current economic considerations

•

evaluating the selection of economic forecasts and economic variables, including weighting of the forecasts, and underlying assumptions by comparing to the Company’s business environment and relevant
                  industry practices

•

evaluating the length of the observation period from which historical Company and peer experience was used and the reasonable and supportable forecast period by comparing them to specific portfolio risk
                  characteristics and trends

•

assessing the composition of the peer group by comparing to Company and specific portfolio risk characteristics

•

evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative adjustments and the effect of those adjustments on the collective ACL on loans by comparing to relevant credit risk factors, the current economic
                  environment and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models.

We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ACL on loans estimate by evaluating the:

•

cumulative results of the audit procedures

•

qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices

•

potential bias in the accounting estimate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2024 and 2023

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of NBT Bancorp Inc. and its subsidiaries, NBT Bank, National Association (“NBT Bank” or the “Bank”), NBT Financial Services, Inc.
      and NBT Holdings, Inc., conform, in all material respects, with GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. Collectively, NBT Bancorp Inc. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein as (the “Company”).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements.

Estimates associated with the allowance for credit losses are particularly
      susceptible to material change in the near term.

The following is a description of significant policies and practices:

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NBT Bancorp Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries mentioned above. All
        material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Amounts previously reported in the consolidated financial statements are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the current year’s presentation. In the “Parent Company
        Financial Information,” the investment in subsidiaries is recorded using the equity method of accounting.

The Company determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable
      interest entity under GAAP. Voting interest entities are entities in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses,
      the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities. The Company consolidates voting interest entities in which it has all, or at least a majority of, the voting interest. As defined in applicable
      accounting standards, variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when the Company has both the power and ability to
      direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company’s wholly-owned
      subsidiaries CNBF Capital Trust I, NBT Statutory Trust I, NBT Statutory Trust II, Alliance Financial Capital Trust I and Alliance Financial Capital Trust II are VIEs for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the accounts of
      these entities are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s operations are primarily in the community banking industry and include the provision of traditional banking services. The Company also provides other
      services through its subsidiaries such as insurance, retirement plan administration and wealth management. The Company operates in the geographical regions of upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Hampshire, western Massachusetts,
      Vermont, southern Maine 
and central and northwestern Connecticut. 

The Company manages its
        operations under the segments of Banking, including Wealth Management, Retirement Plan Administration and Insurance. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company disclosed a 
single
 reportable segment, as revenue from individual segments were below the disclosure threshold relative to consolidated revenue, total assets and operating profit or loss.
        Each year the Company evaluates its business activities, financial results and operational data to determine whether segment disclosure is required.

In accordance with
          Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, and as the Company has grown, management has reassessed its operating segment structure to enhance transparency in how
          financial performance is evaluated and resources are allocated by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). As a result of this reassessment, beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Bank has determined that it now operates
          through 
two
 reportable segments: Banking and Retirement Plan Administration, as they meet both the quantitative threshold and
          qualitative criteria for disclosure. Wealth Management is combined with our Banking segment in accordance with the similarity test outlined in ASC 280. Insurance does not meet materiality requirements for disclosure and is included in the “All
          Other” category.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers amounts due from correspondent banks, cash items in process of collection and institutional money market mutual funds to be cash equivalents for
      purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

61

Table

              of Contents

Securities

The Company classifies its securities at date of purchase as either held to maturity (“HTM”), avialable for sale (“AFS”) or equity. HTM debt securities are those that
      the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. AFS debt securities are securities that are not classified as HTM. AFS securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on AFS
      securities are excluded from earnings and are reported in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
      (“AOCI”). HTM securities are recorded at amortized cost. Transfers of securities between categories are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer. Non-marketable equity securities and equity securities without readily determinable fair values
      are carried at cost. The Company performs a qualitative assessment on equity securities to determine whether the investments are impaired and downward or upward adjustments are recognized through the income statement. All other equity securities are
      recorded at fair value, with net unrealized gains and losses recognized in income.

Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. Dividend and interest income
      are recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses on securities sold are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.

 Investments in Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock stock are required for membership in those organizations and are carried at cost
      since there is no market value available. The FHLB New York continues to pay dividends and repurchase stock. As such, the Company has not recognized any impairment on its holdings of FRB and FHLB stock. 

Allowance for Credit Losses – HTM Debt Securities

With respect to its HTM debt securities, the Company is required to utilize the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 methodology to estimate expected credit losses. Management measures expected credit losses on HTM debt
      securities on a collective basis by major security types that share similar risk characteristics, such as (as applicable): internal or external (third-party) credit score or credit ratings, risk ratings or classification, financial asset type,
      collateral type, size, effective interest rate, term, geographical location, industry of the borrower, vintage, historical or expected credit loss patterns, and reasonable and supportable forecast periods. Management classifies the HTM portfolio into
      the following major security types: U.S. government agency or U.S. government-sponsored mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations securities, and state and municipal debt securities.

The HTM mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations securities are issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are
      either explicitly and/or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government as to timely repayment of principal and interest, are highly rated by major rating agencies, and have a long history of zero credit losses. Therefore, the Company did not record an
      allowance for credit loss for these securities.

State and municipal bonds generally carry a Moody’s rating of A to AAA. In addition, the Company has a limited amount of New York state local
      municipal bonds that are not rated. The estimate of expected credit losses on the HTM portfolio is based on the expected cash flows of each individual bond over its contractual life and considers historical credit loss information, current conditions
      and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Given the rarity of municipal defaults and losses, the Company utilized Moody’s Municipal Loss Forecast Model as the sole source of municipal default and loss rates which provides decades of data across all
      municipal sectors and geographies. As with the loan portfolio, cash flows are forecast over a 6-quarter period under various weighted economic conditions, with a reversion to long-term average economic conditions over a 4-quarter period on a
      straight-line basis. Management may exercise discretion to make adjustments based on environmental factors. The Company determined that the expected credit loss on its HTM municipal bond portfolio was immaterial and therefore 
no
 allowance for credit losses was recorded.

Allowance for Credit Losses – AFS Debt Securities

The impairment model for AFS debt securities differs from the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology utilized for HTM debt securities
      because AFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Bank first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to
      sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities that do
      not meet the aforementioned criteria, in making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, adverse conditions specifically related to
      the security, failure of the issuer of the debt security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the
      security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. The cash flows should be estimated using information relevant to the collectability of the security, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and
      supportable forecasts. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair
      value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.

Loan Held for Sale and Loan Servicing

Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on an individual basis. Loan sales are recorded when the sales are funded. Gains and losses on sales
      of loans held for sale are included in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. Mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. Mortgage servicing rights are recorded at fair value upon sale
      of the loan, and are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.

62

Table

              of Contents

Loans

Loans are recorded at their current unpaid principal balance, net of unearned income and unamortized loan fees and expenses, which are amortized under the effective
      interest method over the estimated lives of the loans. Interest income on loans is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding.

For all loan classes within the Company’s loan portfolio, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when timely collection of principal and/or interest in accordance with
      contractual terms is in doubt. Loans are transferred to nonaccrual status generally when principal or interest payments become over 
ninety days

      delinquent, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, or sooner when management concludes circumstances indicate that borrowers may be unable to meet contractual principal or interest payments. When a loan is transferred to a
      nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued in the current period but not collected is reversed against interest income in that period. Interest accrued in a prior period and not collected is charged-off against the allowance for credit
      losses.

If ultimate repayment of a nonaccrual loan is expected, any payments received are applied in accordance with contractual terms. If ultimate repayment of principal is not
      expected, any payment received on a nonaccrual loan is applied to principal until ultimate repayment becomes expected. For all loan classes within the Company’s loan portfolio, nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when they become current
      as to principal and interest and demonstrate a period of performance under the contractual terms and, in the opinion of management, are fully collectible as to principal and interest. For loans in all portfolios, the principal amount is charged off
      in full or in part as soon as management determines, based on available facts, that the collection of principal in full or in part is improbable. For Commercial loans, management considers specific facts and circumstances relative to individual
      credits in making such a determination. For Consumer and Residential loan classes, management uses specific guidance and thresholds from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account
      Management Policy.

Beginning in 2023, with the Company’s adoption of ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments
        - 
CECL Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”)
, the recognition of a
 troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”)
 was eliminated and instead the Company evaluates borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty or loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. When a borrower is experiencing
        financial difficulties and the Company modifies a loan, such modifications generally include one or a combination of the following: an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with
        similar risk; a change in scheduled payment amount; or principal forgiveness. Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be different from those previously disclosed in TDR disclosures since the Company is no longer required
        to determine if a concession has been granted, which was a requirement to determine whether a loan modification was considered to be a TDR. Historically, a TDR would generally include one or a combination of the following: an extension of the
        maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; a temporary reduction in the interest rate; or a change in scheduled payment amount. TDR loans were nonaccrual loans; however, they could
        be returned to accrual status after a period of performance, generally evidenced by 
six months
 of compliance with their modified terms. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans

The CECL methodology requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of a loan (or pool of loans). The allowance for credit losses
      is a valuation account that is deducted from, or added to, the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net, lifetime amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes a loan
      balance is confirmed to be uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.

Management estimates the allowance balance for credit losses using relevant information, from internal and external sources, related to past events,
      current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. The Company then considers whether
      the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience is used. Adjustments to historical loss
      information is made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level or term as well as changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment
      rates, production metrics, property values, or other relevant factors. Company historical loss experience is supplemented with peer information when there is insufficient loss data for the Company. Peer selection is based on a review of institutions
      with comparable loss experience as well as loan yield, bank size, portfolio concentration and geography. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. Significant management judgment is
      required at various points in the measurement process.

Portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for credit
      losses. Upon adoption of CECL, management revised the manner in which loans were pooled for similar risk characteristics. Management developed segments for estimating loss based on type of borrower and collateral which is generally based upon federal
      call report segmentation and have been combined or subsegmented as needed to ensure loans of similar risk profiles are appropriately pooled.

During 2023, the Company made adjustments to the class segments within the portfolios to better align risk characteristics and reflect the
      monitoring and assessment of risks as the portfolios continue to evolve. Paycheck Protection Program was consolidated with Commercial & Industrial, as the portfolio had decreased to less than $
1
 million and no longer warranted a material class segment. The Other Consumer class segment was further separated into Residential Solar and Other Consumer. The growth in our
      Residential Solar loans warranted evaluation of this class separately from the Other Consumer class segments. The change to the class segments was applied retrospectively and did not have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses. 
The following
      table illustrates the portfolio and class segments for the Company’s loan portfolio:

Commercial Loans

The Company offers a variety of commercial loan products. The Company’s underwriting analysis for commercial loans typically includes credit
      verification, independent appraisals, a review of the borrower’s financial condition and a detailed analysis of the borrower’s underlying cash flows.

Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”)
 – The Company offers
      a variety of loan options to meet the specific needs of our C&I customers including term loans, time notes and lines of credit. Such loans are made available to businesses for working capital needs and are typically collateralized by business
      assets such as equipment, accounts receivable and perishable agricultural products, which are exposed to industry price volatility. To reduce these risks, management also attempts to obtain personal guarantees of the owners or to obtain government
      loan guarantees to provide further support.

Commercial Real Estate (“CRE”)
 – The Company offers CRE
      loans to finance real estate purchases, refinancing’s, expansions and improvements to commercial and agricultural properties. CRE loans are loans that are secured by liens on real estate, which may include both owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied
      properties, such as apartments, commercial structures, health care facilities and other facilities. The Company’s underwriting analysis includes credit verification, independent appraisals, a review of the borrower’s financial condition and a
      detailed analysis of the borrower’s underlying cash flows. These loans are typically originated in amounts of no more than 
80
% of the
      appraised value of the property. Government loan guarantees may be obtained to provide further support for agricultural property.

Consumer Loans

The Company offers a variety of Consumer loan products including Auto, Residential Solar and Other Consumer loans.

Auto 
– The Company provides both direct and indirect
      financing of automobiles (“Auto”). The Company maintains relationships with many dealers primarily in the communities that we serve. Through these relationships, the Company primarily finances the purchases of automobiles indirectly through dealer
      relationships. Auto loans are secured with collateral consisting of a perfected lien on the vehicle being purchased. Most of these loans carry a fixed rate of interest with principal repayment terms typically ranging from 
three
 to 
six years
, based upon the nature
      of the collateral and the size of the loan.

Residential
        Solar
 – The Company offers loans across a national
        footprint originated through our relationships with national technology-driven consumer lending companies to finance the purchase and installation of residential solar energy. Advances of credit through this business line are subject to the
        Company’s underwriting standards including criteria such as FICO score and debt to income thresholds. In 2017, the Company partnered with Sungage Financial, LLC. to offer financing to consumers for solar ownership with the program tailored for
        delivery through solar installers. Advances of credit through this business line are to prime borrowers and are subject to the Company’s underwriting standards. Residential solar loans carry a fixed rate of interest with principal repayment terms
        typically ranging from 
five
 to 
twenty-five years
. Typically, the Company collects origination fees that are deferred and recognized into interest income over the estimated life of the loan.

Other Consumer
 – The Other Consumer loan segment consists primarily of unsecured consumer loans and direct consumer loans. The Company offers unsecured consumer loans across a national footprint originated through our relationships with
          national technology-driven consumer lending companies to finance such things as dental and medical procedures, K-12 tuition and other consumer purpose loans. Advances of credit through this business line are subject to the Company’s underwriting
          standards including criteria such as FICO score and debt to income thresholds. Advances of credit through this business line are to prime borrowers and are subject to the Company’s underwriting standards. Typically, the Company collects
          origination fees that are deferred and recognized into interest income over the estimated life of the loan. The Company offers a variety of direct consumer installment loans to finance various personal expenditures. In addition to installment
          loans, the Company also offers personal lines of credit, overdraft protection, debt consolidation, education and other uses. Direct consumer installment loans carry a fixed rate of interest with principal repayment terms typically ranging from 
one
 to 
fifteen years
, based upon the
          nature of the collateral and the size of the loan. Consumer installment loans are often secured with collateral consisting of a perfected lien on the asset being purchased or a perfected lien on a consumer’s deposit account. Risk is reduced
          through underwriting criteria, which include credit verification, appraisals, a review of the borrower’s financial condition and personal cash flows. A security interest, with title insurance when necessary, is taken in the underlying real
          estate.

              of Contents

Residential

Residential loans consist primarily of loans secured by a first or second mortgage on primary residences, home equity loans and lines of credit in
      first and second lien positions and residential construction loans. We originate adjustable-rate and fixed rate, one-to-four-family residential loans for the construction or purchase of a residential property or the refinancing of a mortgage. These
      loans are collateralized by properties located in the Company’s market area. Loans on one-to-four-family residential are generally originated in amounts of no more than 
85
% of the purchase price or appraised value (whichever is lower) or have private mortgage insurance. Mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance are normally required. Construction loans
      have a unique risk because they are secured by an incomplete dwelling. This risk is reduced through periodic site inspections, including one at each loan draw period. For home equity loans, consumers are able to borrow up to 
85
% of the equity in their homes and are generally tied to Prime with a 
ten-year
 draw followed by a 
fifteen-year
 amortization. These loans carry a
      higher risk than first mortgage residential loans as they are often in a second position with respect to collateral.

Historical credit loss experience over the observation period for both the Company and segment-specific peers provides the basis for the estimation
      of expected credit losses, where observed credit losses are converted using models to probability of default (“PD”) rate curves through the use of segment-specific loss given default (“LGD”) risk factors that convert default rates to loss severity
      based on industry-level, observed relationships between the two variables for each asset class, primarily due to the nature of the underlying collateral. These risk factors were assessed for reasonableness against the Company’s own loss experience
      and adjusted in certain cases when the relationship between the Company’s historical default and loss severity deviated from that of the wider industry. The historical PD curves, together with corresponding economic conditions, establish a
      quantitative relationship between economic conditions and loan performance through an economic cycle.

Using the historical relationship between economic conditions and loan performance, management’s expectation of future loan performance is
      incorporated using externally developed economic forecasts which are probabilistically weighted to reflect potential forecast inaccuracy and model limitations. These forecasts are applied over a period that management has determined to be reasonable
      and supportable. Beyond the period over which management can develop or source a reasonable and supportable forecast, the model will revert to long-term average economic conditions using a straight-line, time-based methodology.

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis, with both a quantitative and qualitative analysis that is applied on a
      quarterly basis, when similar risk characteristics exist. The respective quantitative allowance for each segment is measured using an econometric, PD/LGD modeling methodology in which distinct, segment-specific multi-variate regression models are
      applied to multiple, probabilistically weighted external economic forecasts of economic variables. Under the discounted cash flows methodology, expected credit losses are estimated over the effective life of the loans by measuring the difference
      between the net present value of modeled cash flows and amortized cost basis. Contractual cash flows over the contractual life of the loans are the basis for modeled cash flows, adjusted for modeled defaults, expected prepayments and curtailments and
      discounted at the loan-level stated interest rate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are
      not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.

After quantitative considerations, management applies additional qualitative adjustments so that the allowance for credit losses is reflective of
      the estimate of lifetime losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Qualitative considerations include limitations inherent in the quantitative model; trends experienced in nonperforming and delinquent loans; changes in value
      of underlying collateral; changes in lending policies and procedures; nature and composition of loans; portfolio concentrations that may affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio; the experience, ability and depth of
      lending management and staff; the Company’s credit review system; and the effect of external factors; such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements.

The threshold for evaluating classified, commercial and CRE loans risk graded substandard or doubtful, and nonperforming loans specifically
      evaluated for individual credit loss is $
1.0
 million. When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are
      based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. If the loan is not collateral dependent, the allowance for credit losses related to individually assessed loans is based on discounted
      expected cash flows using the loan’s initial effective interest rate. Generally, individually assessed loans are collateral dependent.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures

The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company has exposure to credit risk via a contractual
      obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as an expense in other noninterest expense. The estimate includes
      consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated lives. Estimating credit losses on unfunded commitments requires the Bank to consider the
      following categories of off-balance sheet credit exposure: unfunded commitments to extend credit, unfunded lines of credit and standby letters of credit. Each of these unfunded commitments is then analyzed for a probability of funding to calculate a
      probable funding amount. The life of loan loss factor by related portfolio segment from the loan allowance for credit loss calculation is then applied to the probable funding amount to calculate a reserve on unfunded commitments.

Accrued Interest Receivable

Accrued interest receivable (“AIR”) balances are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has excluded interest
      receivable that is included in amortized cost of financing receivables from related disclosure requirements and AIR is written off by reversing interest income. For loans, write off typically occurs upon becoming over 
90
 to 
120
 days past due and therefore the
      amount of such write offs are immaterial. Historically, the Company has not experienced uncollectible AIR on investment securities.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of premises and equipment is determined using the straight-line method over the
      estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred.

Leases

The Company determines if a lease is present at the inception of an agreement. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement
      based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, are included in other assets and
      other liabilities, respectively, on the 
consolidated balance sheets
. Leases with original terms of 12 months or less are recognized in profit or loss on a
      straight-line basis over the lease term.

Operating lease ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to
      make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are further adjusted for lease incentives. Operating lease expense, which is comprised of amortization of the ROU asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability, is
      recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and is recorded in occupancy expense in the 
consolidated statements of income
.

The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For real estate leases, non-lease components and
      other non-components, such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes and insurance are not included in the measurement of the lease liability since they are generally able to be segregated. Our leases relate primarily to office space and
      bank branches, and some contain options to renew the lease. These options to renew are generally not considered reasonably certain to exercise, and are therefore not included in the lease term until such time that the option to renew is reasonably
      certain.

Other Real Estate Owned

Other real estate owned (“OREO”) consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or by acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. These assets are recorded at the
      lower of fair value of the asset acquired less estimated costs to sell or “cost” (defined as the fair value at initial foreclosure). At the time of foreclosure, or when foreclosure occurs in-substance, any excess loan balance over fair market value
      of the acquired asset, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent valuation write-downs are recorded as other expense. In connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the
      valuation of OREO, management obtains appraisals for properties. Operating costs associated with the properties are expensed as incurred. Gains on the sale of OREO are recognized as income when title has passed and the sale has met the minimum down
      payment requirements prescribed by GAAP. The balance of OREO is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business in excess of the fair value of the related net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested at the reporting
      unit level for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis or when events or circumstances dictate. The Company has elected June 30 as the annual impairment testing date for the insurance and retirement services reporting units and December
      31 for the Bank reporting unit.

The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors, by performing a qualitative analysis, to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads
      to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the events or circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
      reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the impairment test is not required. If the Company concludes otherwise, the Company is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair
      value of a reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount in order to determine if impairment is indicated. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount, the reporting unit is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is
      below the carrying value of the reporting unit, the difference is the amount of impairment.

Intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives
      are amortized over their useful lives. Core deposit intangibles and trust intangibles at the Company are amortized using the sum-of-the-years’-digits method. Covenants not to compete are amortized on a straight-line basis. Customer lists are
      amortized using an accelerated method. When facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the asset carrying value, using estimates of undiscounted future cash
      flows over the remaining asset life. Any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the goodwill impairment tests and determining the fair value of other intangible assets are judgmental and often
      involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using the discounted cash flows method, which uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rates
      reflecting the market rate of return and projected growth rates. Future events may impact such estimates and assumptions and could cause the Company to conclude that our goodwill or intangible assets have become impaired, which would result in
      recording an impairment loss.

Bank Owned Life Insurance

The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain employees, key executives and directors. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be
      realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock acquisitions are recorded at cost. Subsequent sales of treasury stock are recorded on an average cost basis. Gains on the sale of treasury stock are
      credited to additional paid-in-capital. Losses on the sale of treasury stock are charged to additional paid-in-capital to the extent of previous gains, otherwise charged to retained earnings.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
      between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
      those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax
      assets to the amount expected to be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of adequate future taxable income. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax
      benefits in income tax expense.

Tax positions are recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination
      being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.

Pension Costs

The Company has a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees, as well as supplemental employee retirement plans
      to certain current and former executives and a defined benefit postretirement healthcare plan that covers certain employees. Costs associated with these plans, based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits for employees, are charged
      to current operating expenses.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company maintains various long-term incentive stock benefit plans under which restricted stock units are granted to certain directors and key
      employees. Compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the requisite service period, based on the grant-date fair value of the award. For restricted stock units, compensation expense is recognized ratably over the
      vesting period for the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
      in the earnings of the entity (such as the Company’s dilutive restricted stock units and stock options).

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

At the Company, comprehensive income (loss) represents net income plus OCI, which consists primarily of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt
      securities for the period, changes in the funded status of employee benefit plans and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives designated as hedging instruments. AOCI represents the net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt securities, the previously
      unrecognized portion of the funded status of employee benefit plans and the fair value of instruments designated as hedging instruments, net of income taxes, as of the consolidated balance sheet dates.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended
      use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives
      designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and
      qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss
      recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions
      in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are
      recognized in earnings.

When the Company purchases or sells a portion of a commercial loan that has an existing interest rate swap, it may enter into a risk participation agreement 
to provide credit protection to the financial institution that originated the swap transaction should the borrower fail to perform on its obligation. The Company enters
        into both risk participation agreements in which it purchases credit protection from other financial institutions and those in which it provides credit protection to other financial institutions
. Any fee paid to the Company under a risk
      participation agreement is in consideration of the credit risk of the counterparties and is recognized in the income statement. Credit risk on the risk participation agreements is determined after considering the risk rating, PD and LGD of the
      counterparties.

Business Combinations

Business

            combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities are recorded at their acquisition date estimated fair values. The excess of
            the cost of acquisition over these fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date, changes to estimated fair values are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill.
            Certain transaction costs are expensed as incurred. See Note 3 for additional information.

Fair Value Measurements

GAAP states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
      between market participants. Fair value measurements are not adjusted for transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy exists within GAAP that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
      priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

 Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
      assets or liabilities; 

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable, either directly
      or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no
      market activity).

A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most U.S. government and agency securities, many other sovereign government
      obligations, liquid mortgage products, active listed equities and most money market securities. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company does not adjust the quoted prices for such
      instruments.

The types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations or quote from alternative pricing sources with
      reasonable levels of price transparency include most investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, less liquid mortgage products, less liquid agency securities, less liquid listed equities, state, municipal and provincial obligations and certain
      physical commodities. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain common equity securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs (exchange quoted prices). Other investment securities are
      reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The prices for Level 2 instruments are obtained through an independent pricing service or dealer market participants with whom the Company has historically transacted both purchases and
      sales of investment securities. Prices obtained from these sources include prices derived from market quotations and matrix pricing. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the
      U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and conditions, among other things. Management reviews the methodologies used  by its third-party
      providers in pricing the securities.

Level 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions. Valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or
      non-transferability and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate will be used. Management’s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain
      Level 3 investments. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment
      or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets and changes in financial ratios or cash flows.

Other Financial Instruments

The Company is a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
      financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit, standby letter of credit and certain agricultural real estate loans sold to investors with recourse, with the sold portion having a government guarantee that is
      assignable back to the Company upon repurchase of the loan in the event of default. The Company’s policy is to record such instruments when funded.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. The risk involved in issuing standby letters of
      credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers and letters of credit are subject to the same credit origination, portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit
      and off-balance sheet products. Under the standby letters of credit, the Company is required to make payments to the beneficiary of the letters of credit upon request by the beneficiary contingent upon the customer’s failure to perform under the
      terms of the underlying contract with the beneficiary. Standby letters of credit typically have 
one-year
 expiration terms with an option
      to renew upon annual review. The Company typically receives a fee for these transactions. The fair value of standby letters of credit is recorded upon inception.

Repurchase Agreements

Repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured financing transactions since the Company maintains effective control over the transferred
      securities and the transfer meets the other criteria for such accounting. Obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The securities underlying the agreements are delivered to a custodial
      account for the benefit of the counterparties with whom each transaction is executed. The counterparties, who may sell, loan or otherwise dispose of such securities to other parties in the normal course of their operations, agree to resell to the
      Company the same securities at the maturities of the agreements.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, 
Revenue

        from Contracts with Customers

(Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606) 
(“ASC 606”), and all subsequent ASUs that modified ASC 606. ASC
      606 does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including revenue from loans and securities and certain noninterest income streams such as fees associated with mortgage servicing rights, financial guarantees, derivatives and
      certain credit card fees are also not in scope. ASC 606 is applicable to noninterest revenue streams such as retirement plan administration fees, trust and asset management income, deposit related fees and annuity and insurance commissions.
      Noninterest revenue streams in-scope of ASC 606 are discussed below.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts consist of overdraft fees, monthly service fees, check orders and other deposit account related fees. Overdraft, monthly service,
      check orders and other deposit account related fees are transactional based, and therefore, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is
      primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to customers’ accounts.

Card Services Income

ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a Company ATM. Debit card income is primarily
      comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Company’s debit cards are processed through card payment networks. The Company’s performance obligations for these revenue streams are satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are
      rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month.

Retirement Plan Administration Fees

Retirement plan administration fees are primarily generated for services related to the recordkeeping, administration and plan design solutions of defined benefit,
      defined contribution and revenue sharing plans. Revenue is recognized in arrears for services already provided in accordance with fees established in contracts with customers or based on rates agreed to with investment trade platforms based on ending
      investment balances held. The Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized based on services completed or ending investment balances, for which receivables are recorded at the time of revenue recognition.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management revenue primarily is comprised of trust and other financial services revenue. Trust and asset management income is primarily
      comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts, pensions and other customer assets. The Company’s performance obligation is generally satisfied with the resulting fees recognized monthly, based upon services completed or
      the month-end market value of the assets under management and the applicable fee rate. Payment is generally received shortly after services are rendered or a few days after month end through a direct charge to customers’ accounts. The Company does
      not earn performance-based incentives. Financial services revenue primarily consists of commissions received on brokered investment product sales. For other financial services revenue, the Company’s performance obligation is generally satisfied upon
      the issuance of the annuity policy. Shortly after the policy is issued, the carrier remits the commission payment to the Company, and the Company recognizes the revenue. The Company does not earn a significant amount of trailing commission fees on
      brokered investment product sales. The majority of the trailing commission fees are calculated based on a percentage of market value of a period end and revenue is recognized when an investment product’s market value can be determined.

Insurance Revenue

Insurance and other financial services revenue primarily consists of commissions received on insurance. The Company acts as an intermediary between
      the Company’s customer and the insurance carrier. The Company’s performance obligation related to insurance sales for both property and casualty insurance and employee benefit plans is generally satisfied upon the later of the issuance or effective
      date of the policy. The Company earns performance based incentives, commonly known as contingent payments, which usually are based on certain criteria established by the insurance carrier such as premium volume, growth and insured loss ratios.
      Contingent payments are accrued for based upon management’s expectations for the year. Commission expense associated with sales of insurance products is expensed as incurred. The Company does not earn a significant amount of trailing commission fees
      on insurance product sales. The majority of the trailing commission fees are calculated based on a percentage of market value of a period end and revenue is recognized when an investment product’s market value can be determined.

              of Contents

Other

Other noninterest income consists of other recurring revenue streams such as account and loan fees, interest rate swap fees, safe deposit box rental fees and other
      miscellaneous revenue streams. These revenue streams are primarily transactional based and payment is received immediately or in the following month, and therefore, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, and the related revenue is
      recognized, at a point in time.

Contract Balances

A contract asset balance occurs when an entity performs a service for a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, which would result in
      contract receivables or assets, respectively. A contract liability balance is an entity’s obligation to transfer a service to a customer for which the entity has already received payment or for which payment is due from the customer. The Company’s
      noninterest revenue streams are largely based on transactional activity, or standard month-end revenue accruals such as asset management fees based on month-end market values. Consideration is often received immediately or shortly after the Company
      satisfies its performance obligation and revenue is recognized. The Company does not typically enter into long-term revenue contracts with customers, and therefore, does not experience significant contract balances.

Contract Acquisition Costs

ASC 606 requires the capitalization, and subsequently amortization into expense, of certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if these costs are
      expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company elected the
      practical expedient, which allows immediate expensing of contract acquisition costs when the asset that would have resulted from capitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one year or less, and did not capitalize any contract acquisition
      costs as of or during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Trust Operations

Assets held by the Company in a fiduciary or agency capacity for its customers are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, since such assets are
      not assets of the Company.

Subsequent Events

The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and/or disclosure and there were none identified.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In November
              2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,
 to enhance reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring annual and interim disclosure of incremental
              segment information. In addition, the amendments will enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for
              entities with a single reportable segment and include other disclosure requirements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years
              beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis, and aside from meeting the new disclosure requirements, the adoption did not have a material
              impact on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 and Note 22 for additional information.

Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted 

In December 2023, the
          FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, in response to requests from investors, lenders, creditors and other allocators of capital for enhanced income tax disclosures to support
          capital allocation decisions. The ASU requires enhanced disclosures primarily related to existing rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information to help investors better assess how the Company’s operations and related tax risks and tax
          planning and operational opportunities affect the Company’s tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The ASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company on January 1,
          2025 and should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application and early adoption are permitted. Aside from complying with the new disclosure requirements, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated
          financial statements.

In November
          2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,
 that addresses
          longstanding investor requests for more information of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. The ASU will require a tabular disclosure that disaggregates certain income statement expenses
          including employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization. In January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
            (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date,
 which revises the effective date of ASU 2024-03. The ASU will become effective in the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and early adoption is permitted. Aside
          from complying with the new disclosure requirements, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions

Pending Acquisition of
          Evans Bancorp, Inc. (Unaudited)

On September 9, 2024,
          the Company and the Bank, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Evans Bancorp, Inc. (“Evans”) and Evans Bank, National Association (“Evans Bank”), Evans’s subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company will acquire
          Evans. Evans, with assets of approximately $
2.19
 billion at December 31, 2024, is headquartered in Williamsville, New York. Its primary
          subsidiary, Evans Bank, is a federally-chartered national banking association operating 
18
 banking locations in Western New York.

Subject to the terms
          and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of each party, Evans will merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity, and immediately thereafter, Evans Bank will merge with
          and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank (the “Merger”).

Under the terms of
          the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Evans common stock will be converted into the right to receive 
0.91
 shares of the
          Company’s common stock. In December 2024, NBT announced that it had received the regulatory approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the waiver from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York necessary to complete its
          acquisition of Evans. Also in December 2024, the shareholders of Evans voted to approve the Merger. Evans reported over 
75
% of the
          issued and outstanding shares of Evans were represented at a special shareholder meeting and over 
96
% of the votes cast were voted to
          approve the Merger. NBT and Evans anticipate closing the transaction in second quarter of 2025 in conjunction with the core system conversion, pending customary closing conditions.

The Company incurred
          acquisition expenses related to the Merger of $
1.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Prior Period Acquisitions

On August 11, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Salisbury Bancorp, Inc. (“Salisbury”) through the merger of Salisbury with and into the
      Company, with the Company surviving the merger, for $
161.7
 million in stock. Salisbury Bank and Trust Company, Salisbury’s subsidiary, was
      a Connecticut-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Lakeville, Connecticut, operating 
13
 banking offices. The acquisition enhances
      the Company’s presence in Massachusetts’ Berkshire county, and extends its footprint into New York’s Dutchess, Orange and Ulster counties and Connecticut’s Litchfield county. In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued 
4.32
 million shares of common stock and acquired approximately $
1.46
 billion of identifiable assets. Goodwill of $
79.7
 million was recognized as a result of the merger
      and is not amortizable or deductible for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised the estimated fair value of premises and equipment, net and related deferred income taxes based upon receipt of land and building
      appraisals, which resulted in a $
1.7
 million increase in goodwill. The effects of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in
      the consolidated financial statements since that date. As a result of the full integration of the operations of Salisbury, it is not practicable to determine all revenue or net income included in the Company’s operating results relating to Salisbury
      since the date of acquisition as Salisbury results cannot be separately identified.

The Company determined that this acquisition constituted a business combination and therefore was accounted for using the acquisition method of
      accounting. Accordingly, as of the date of the acquisition, the Company recorded the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration paid at fair value based on management’s best estimates using information available at the date of the
      acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on updated information not available at the time of the acquisition. The amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected
      from combining the operations of the Company with Salisbury.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company used an independent valuation specialist
          to assist with the determination of fair values for certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities.

Cash and due from banks
 - The estimated fair value was determined to approximate the carrying amount of these assets.

Securities available for sale
 - The estimated fair value of the investment portfolio was based on quoted market prices and dealer quotes. The investment securities were sold
          immediately after the merger and no gains or losses were recorded.

Loans
 - The estimated fair value of loans were based on a discounted cash flow methodology applied on a pooled basis for
 non-purchased credit deteriorated (“non-PCD”) loans
        and for purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans.
 The valuation
          considered underlying characteristics including loan type, term, rate, payment schedule and credit rating. Other factors included assumptions related to prepayments, PD and LGD. The discount rates applied were based on a build-up approach
          considering the funding mix, servicing costs, liquidity premium and factors related to performance risk.

Core deposit intangible
 - The core deposit intangible was valued utilizing the cost savings method approach, which recognizes the cost savings represented by the expense of
          maintaining the core deposit base versus the cost of an alternative funding source. The valuation incorporates assumptions related to account retention, discount rates, deposit interest rates, deposit maintenance costs and alternative funding
          rates.

Wealth management customer intangible
 - The wealth management customer intangible was valued utilizing the income approach, which employs a present value analysis, which
          calculates the expected after-tax cash flow benefits of the net revenues generated by the acquired customers over the expected lives of the acquired customers, discounted at a long-term market-oriented after-tax rate of return on investment. The
          value assigned to the acquired customers represents the future economic benefit from acquiring the customers (net of operating expenses).

Deposits
 - The fair value of noninterest bearing demand deposits, interest checking, money market and savings deposit accounts from Salisbury were assumed to approximate the
          carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand.
 Certificate of deposit (“CD”)
 (time deposit accounts) were valued at the present value of the certificates’ expected contractual payments discounted at market rates for similar certificates.

Borrowings
 - The estimated fair value of short-term borrowings was determined to approximate stated value. Subordinated debt was valued using a discounted cash flow approach
          incorporating a discount rate that incorporated similar terms, maturity and credit rating.

Accounting for Acquired Loans - 
Acquired

          loans are classified into two categories: PCD loans and non-PCD loans. PCD loans are defined as a loan or group of loans that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Non-PCD loans had an allowance
          established on acquisition date, which was recognized as an expense through the provision for credit losses. For PCD loans, an allowance was recognized by adding it to the fair value of the loan, which is the amortized cost. There is no provision
          for credit loss expense recognized on PCD loans because the initial allowance is established by grossing-up the amortized cost of the PCD loan. The allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans of $
8.8
 million was recorded through the provision for loan losses within the unaudited interim consolidated statements of income.

The following table provides details related to the fair value of acquired PCD loans.

Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)

The following table presents certain
            unaudited pro forma financial information for illustrative purposes only, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as if Salisbury had been acquired on January 1, 2022. This unaudited pro forma information combines the historical results
            of Salisbury with the Company’s consolidated historical results and includes certain adjustments reflecting the estimated impact of certain fair value adjustments for the respective periods. The pro forma information is not indicative of what
            would have occurred had the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the year prior to the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma information does not consider any changes to the provision expense resulting from recording loan assets at fair
            value, cost savings or business synergies. As a result, actual amounts would have differed from the unaudited pro forma information presented and the differences could be significant.

Table

                of Contents

The Company does not believe the AFS securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which consisted of 
401
 and 
388
 individual securities,
      respectively, represented a credit loss impairment. AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of the AFS securities in an
      unrealized loss position consisted of debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises that carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, which are widely recognized as “risk-free” and
      have a long history of zero credit losses. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment
      securities. The Company does not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. The Company elected to exclude AIR from
      the amortized cost basis of debt securities. AIR on AFS debt securities totaled $
4.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
3.9
 million at December 31, 2023 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and reported in the 
other assets
 financial statement line.

None
 of the Bank’s HTM debt securities were past due
      or on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. There was 
no
 accrued interest reversed against interest income for the years
      ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 as all securities remained in accrual status. In addition, there were 
no
 collateral-dependent HTM
      debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. There was 
no
 allowance for credit losses on HTM securities as of December 31, 2024
      and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
66
% of the Company’s HTM debt securities were issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S.
      government-sponsored enterprises with bond ratings of A to AAA. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, which are widely recognized as “risk free,” and have a long history of zero credit losses.
      Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The remaining HTM debt securities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were comprised of state and municipal obligations with bond
      ratings of A to AAA excluding the $
84.7
 million of local municipal bonds which are not rated. Based on the Company’s CECL methodology, the
      expected credit loss on the HTM municipal bond portfolio was deemed immaterial, therefore no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. AIR on HTM debt securities totaled $
4.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
4.7
 million at December 31,
      2023 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and reported in the 
other assets
 financial statement line.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company serviced $
24.7
 million
      and $
26.4
 million, respectively, of agricultural loans sold with recourse. Due to sufficient collateral on these loans and government
      guarantees, no reserve is considered necessary at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

FHLB advances are collateralized by a blanket lien on the Company’s residential real estate mortgages.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has made loans at prevailing rates and terms to directors, officers and other related parties. Such loans, in
      management’s opinion, do not present more than the normal risk of collectability or incorporate other unfavorable features. The aggregate amount of loans outstanding to qualifying related parties and changes during the years are summarized as

Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit Quality of Loans

The allowance for credit losses totaled $
116.0
 million at 
December 31, 2024
, compared to $
114.4
 million at 
December
          31, 2023
. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 
1.16
%
 at 
December 31, 2024
, compared
            to 
1.19
%
 at 
December 31, 2023
.

The allowance for credit losses calculation incorporated a 6-quarter forecast period to account for forecast economic conditions under each scenario
        utilized in the measurement. For periods beyond the 6-quarter forecast, the model reverts to long-term economic conditions over a 4-quarter reversion period on a straight-line basis. The Company considers a baseline, upside and downside economic
        forecast in measuring the allowance.

The quantitative model as of December 31, 2024 incorporated a baseline economic outlook along with an alternative downside scenario sourced from a
        reputable third-party to accommodate other potential economic conditions in the model. At December 31, 2024, the weightings were 80% and 20% for the baseline and downside economic forecasts, respectively. The baseline outlook reflected a Northeast
        unemployment rate environment starting at 4.1% and increasing slightly during the forecast period to 4.2%. Northeast Gross Domestic Product (“GDP’s”) annualized growth (on a quarterly basis) is expected to start the first quarter of 2025 at
        approximately 3.8% before decreasing to a low of 2.6% in the third quarter of 2025 and then increasing to 3.9% by the end of the forecast period. Key assumptions in the baseline economic outlook included 
two 25 basis point federal funds rate cuts in 2025, quantitative tightening
          ending in early 2025, a post-election fiscal outlook with lower spending, lower taxes, and higher tariffs, and the economy currently being near full employment.
 The alternative downside scenario assumed deteriorated economic conditions
        from the baseline outlook. Under this scenario, Northeast unemployment increases to a peak of 7.5% in the first quarter of 2026. These scenarios and their respective weightings are evaluated at each measurement date and reflect management’s
        expectations as of December 31, 2024. Additional qualitative adjustments were made for factors not incorporated in the forecasts or the model, such as loss rate expectations for certain loan pools, considerations for inflation and recent trends in
        asset value indices. Additional monitoring for industry concentrations, loan growth and policy exceptions was also conducted. 

The quantitative model as of December 31, 2023 incorporated a baseline economic outlook along with an alternative downside scenario sourced from a
        reputable third-party to accommodate other potential economic conditions in the model. At December 31, 2023, the weightings were 70% and 30% for the baseline and downside economic forecasts, respectively. The baseline outlook reflected an
        unemployment rate environment starting at 3.8% and increasing slightly during the forecast period to 4.1%. Northeast GDP’s annualized growth (on a quarterly basis) was expected to start the first quarter o
f 2024 at approximately 3.7% before decreasing to a low of 2.9% in the third
          quarter of 2024 and then increasing to 3.8% by the end of the forecast period.
 Other utilized economic variable forecasts 
are mixed compared to the prior year, with retail sales improving, business output mixed and housing starts down
. Key assumptions in the baseline
        economic outlook included 
currently
          being in a full employment economy, continued tapering of the Federal Reserve balance sheet and the
 Federal Open Market Committee
 beginning to cut rates in the second quarter of 2024. The alternative downside scenario assumed deteriorated economic conditions from the
          baseline outlook. Under this scenario, Northeast unemployment increases to a peak of 7.0% in the first quarter of 2025. These scenarios and their respective weightings are evaluated at each measurement date and reflect management’s expectations
          as of December 31, 2023. Additional qualitative adjustments were made for factors not incorporated in the forecasts or the model, such as loss rate expectations for certain loan pools, considerations for inflation and recent trends in asset value
          indices. Additional monitoring for industry concentrations, loan growth and policy exceptions was also conducted.

The quantitative model as of December 31, 2022 incorporated a baseline economic outlook along with an alternative downside scenario sourced from a
        reputable third-party to accommodate other potential economic conditions in the model. At December 31, 2022, the weightings were 50% and 50% for the baseline and downside economic forecasts, respectively. The baseline outlook reflected an
        unemployment rate environment initially around pre-coronavirus (“COVID-19”) levels levels at 3.9% that increases slightly during the forecast period to 4.0%. Northeast GDP’s annualized growth (on a quarterly basis) was expected to start the first
        quarter of 2023 at approximately 3.9% and hovering around 4.6% by the end of the forecast period. Other utilized economic variables have generally deteriorated in their respective forecasts, with retail sales and housing starts forecasts declining
        from the prior year. Key assumptions in the baseline economic outlook included a full employment economy being realized in the near future, continued tapering of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, an increasing yield on ten-year treasury securities
        and a gradual decline in global oil prices. The alternative downside scenario assumed deteriorated economic and pandemic related conditions from the baseline outlook. Under this scenario, Northeast unemployment rises from 3.9% in the fourth quarter
        of 2022 to a peak of 6.9% in the first quarter of 2024. These scenarios and their respective weightings are evaluated at each measurement date and reflect management’s expectations as of December 31, 2022. Additional qualitative adjustments were
        made for factors not incorporated in the forecasts or the model, such as loss rate expectations for certain loan pools, considerations for inflation and recent trends in asset value indices. Additional monitoring for industry concentrations, loan
        growth and policy exceptions was also conducted.

 estimated allowance for credit losses related to AIR at December 31, 2024 and 2023 as it is excluded from
              amortized cost.

The Company’s
            January 1, 2023 adoption of ASU 2022-02, 
Financial Instruments - CECL Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures
 resulted in an insignificant change to its methodology for
            estimating the allowance for credit losses on TDRs. The ASU eliminated the guidance on TDRs and requires an evaluation on all loan modifications to determine if they result in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. The decrease in
            allowance for credit loss on TDR loans relating to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 was $
0.6
 million.

The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 increased compared to the allowance estimates as of December 31, 2023 primarily due to providing for current year loan growth, the slowing of
              prepayment speed assumptions, including the changes in prepayment model assumptions. These increases to the allowance for credit losses were partially offset by the change in forecast scenario weightings from 
70
% baseline and 
30
% downside to 
80
% baseline and 
20
% downside, and
              the shift in loan composition driven by other consumer and residential solar portfolios that are in a planned run-off status.
 The increase in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily due
            to the recording of $
14.5
 million of allowance for acquired Salisbury loans as of the acquisition date, which included both the $
8.8
 million of non-PCD allowance recognized through the provision for loan losses and the $
5.8
 million of PCD allowance reclassified from loans. The increase in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in loan
            balances and a modest deterioration in the economic forecast.

Individually Evaluated Loans

The threshold for evaluating classified, commercial and CRE loans risk graded substandard or doubtful, and nonperforming loans individually evaluated for credit loss is $
1.0
 million. As of December 31, 2024, 
three

              relationships were identified for individual credit loss evaluation which had an amortized cost basis of $
28.8

              million, with 
no
 allowance for credit loss. As of December 31, 2023, 
two
 of the three same relationships were identified for individual credit loss evaluation which had an amortized cost basis of $
17.3
 million, with 
no
 allowance for credit loss.

The increase in
              the amortized cost basis on an individual relationship basis from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the addition of 
one

              new individually evaluated relationship with an amortized cost basis of $
14.0
 million. This increase was partially offset by $
2.2
 million of charge-offs experienced during the year on the other two individually evaluated relationships.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were $
28.8
 million and $
17.3
 million, respectively, of loans
                  in nonaccrual status that were individually evaluated for expected credit loss without an allowance for credit losses.

Credit Quality Indicators

The Company has developed an internal loan grading system to evaluate and quantify the Company’s loan portfolio with respect to quality and risk, focusing on, among
        other things, borrower’s financial strength, experience and depth of borrower’s management, primary and secondary sources of repayment, payment history, nature of the business and industry outlook. The internal grading system enables the Company to
        monitor the quality of the entire loan portfolio on a consistent basis and provide management with an early warning system, which facilitates recognition and response to problem loans and potential problem loans.

Commercial Grading System

For C&I and CRE loans, the Company uses a grading system that relies on quantifiable and measurable characteristics when available. This includes comparison of
        financial strength to available industry averages, comparison of transaction factors (loan terms and conditions) to loan policy and comparison of credit history to stated repayment terms and industry averages. Some grading factors are necessarily
        more subjective such as economic and industry factors, regulatory environment and management. C&I and CRE loans are graded Doubtful, Substandard, Special Mention and Pass.

Doubtful

A Doubtful loan has a high probability of total or substantial loss, but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the asset, its
        classification as a loss is deferred. Doubtful borrowers are usually in default, lack adequate liquidity or capital and lack the resources necessary to remain an operating entity. Pending events can include mergers, acquisitions, liquidations,
        capital injections, the perfection of liens on additional collateral, the valuation of collateral and refinancing. Generally, pending events should be resolved within a relatively short period and the ratings will be adjusted based on the new
        information. Nonaccrual treatment is required for Doubtful assets because of the high probability of loss.

Substandard

Substandard loans have a high probability of payment default or they have other well-defined weaknesses. They require more intensive supervision
          by bank management. Substandard loans are generally characterized by current or expected unprofitable operations, inadequate debt service coverage, inadequate liquidity or marginal capitalization. Repayment may depend on collateral or other
          credit risk mitigants. For some Substandard loans, the likelihood of full collection of interest and principal may be in doubt and those loans should be placed on nonaccrual. Although Substandard assets in the aggregate will have a distinct
          potential for loss, an individual asset’s loss potential does not have to be distinct for the asset to be rated Substandard.

81

Table

                of Contents

Special Mention

Special Mention loans have potential weaknesses that may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company’s
        position at some future date. These loans pose elevated risk, but their weakness does not yet justify a Substandard classification. Borrowers may be experiencing adverse operating trends (i.e., declining revenues or margins) or may be struggling
        with an ill-proportioned balance sheet (i.e., increasing inventory without an increase in sales, high leverage and/or tight liquidity). Adverse economic or market conditions, such as interest rate increases or the entry of a new competitor, may
        also support a Special Mention rating. Although a Special Mention loan has a higher PD than a Pass asset, its default is not imminent.

Pass

Loans graded as Pass encompass all loans not graded as Doubtful, Substandard or Special Mention. Pass loans are in compliance with loan covenants
        and payments are generally made as agreed. Pass loans range from superior quality to fair quality. Pass loans also include any portion of a government guaranteed loan, including Paycheck Protection Program loans.

Consumer and Residential Grading System

Consumer and Residential loans are graded as either Nonperforming or Performing.

Nonperforming

Nonperforming loans are loans that are (1) over 
90
 days past due and interest is still accruing or (2) on nonaccrual status.

Performing

All loans not meeting any of the above criteria are considered Performing.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulties

The Company’s January 1, 2023 adoption of ASU 2022-02 eliminates the recognition and measurement of TDRs. Upon adoption of this guidance, the Company no longer recognizes an allowance for credit losses for the economic concession granted
          to a borrower for changes in the timing and amount of contractual cash flows when a loan is restructured. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 resulted in a change to reporting for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. With
          the adoption of ASU 2022-02 these modifications required enhanced reporting on the type of modifications granted and the financial magnitude of the concessions granted.

When the Company modifies a loan with financial difficulty, such modifications generally include one or a combination of the following: an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for
          new debt with similar risk; a change in scheduled payment amount; or principal forgiveness.

The following table shows the amortized cost basis at the end of the reporting period of the loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,
          disaggregated by class of financing receivable and type of concession granted:

Troubled Debt Restructuring

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, the Company accounted for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty when concessions
        were granted as TDRs. The following tables are disclosures related to TDRs in prior periods.

 The following tables illustrate the recorded investment and number of modifications designated as TDRs, including the recorded

Operating leases in which the Company is the lessee are recorded as operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, included in 
other assets
 and 
other liabilities
,
      respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have any significant finance leases in which we are the lessee as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Operating lease ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent
      our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents the
      Company’s incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. ROU assets are further adjusted for lease incentives. Operating lease expense, which is comprised of amortization of the ROU asset and the implicit interest accreted on the
      operating lease liability, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy expense in the consolidated statements of income.

The Company made a policy election to exclude the recognition requirements to all classes of leases with original terms of 12 months or less.
      Instead, the short-term lease payments are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For real estate leases,
      non-lease components and other non-components, such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes and insurance are not included in the measurement of the lease liability since they are generally able to be segregated.

Our leases relate primarily to office space and bank branches, and some contain options to renew the lease. These options to renew are generally not
      considered reasonably certain to exercise, and are therefore not included in the lease term until such time that the option to renew is reasonably certain. As of December 31, 2024, operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were $
27.6
 million and $
30.3
 million,
      respectively. As of December 31, 2023, operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were $

Borrowings

Short-Term Borrowings

In addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows, liquidity must also be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent
        banks as well as borrowings from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank. Other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time, including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered CD accounts.

Short-term borrowings totaled $
162.9
 million and $
386.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and
        2023, respectively, and consist of Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, which generally represent
        overnight borrowing transactions and other short-term borrowings, primarily FHLB advances, with original maturities of one year or less.

The Company has unused lines of credit with the FHLB and access to brokered deposits available for short-term financing. Those sources totaled approximately $
3.46
 billion and $
2.87
 billion at
        December 31, 2024 and 2023,
        respectively. Borrowings on the FHLB lines are secured by FHLB stock, certain securities and one-to-four family first lien mortgage loans. Securities collateralizing repurchase agreements are held in safekeeping by nonaffiliated financial
        institutions and are under the Company’s control.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of obligations having an original maturity at issuance of more than one year. A majority of the Company’s long-term debt
          is comprised of FHLB advances collateralized by the FHLB stock owned by the Company, and a blanket lien on its residential real estate mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2024 the Company had no callable long-term debt. A summary is as follows:

Subordinated Debt

On June 23, 2020, the Company issued $
100.0

          million aggregate principal amount of 
5.00
% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030. The subordinated notes, which qualify
          as Tier 2 capital, bear interest at an annual rate of 
5.00
%, payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on January 1, 2021, and a
          floating rate of interest equivalent to the 
three-month
 Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“
SOFR
”) plus a spread of 
4.85
%, payable quarterly in arrears
          commencing on October 1, 2025. The subordinated notes issuance costs of $
2.2
 million are being amortized on a straight-line basis into
          interest expense over 
five years
.

The Company may redeem the subordinated notes (1) in whole or in part beginning with the interest payment date of July 1, 2025, and on any
          interest payment date thereafter or (2) in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a “Tax Event”, a “Tier 2 Capital Event” or in the event the Company is required to register as an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act of
          1940, as amended. The redemption price for any redemption is 
100
% of the principal amount of the subordinated notes being redeemed,
          plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Any redemption of the subordinated notes will be subject to the receipt of the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to the extent then
          required under applicable laws or regulations, including capital regulations. 
The Company repurchased $
2.0
 million of the subordinated notes during the year ended December 31, 2022 at a discount of $
0.1
 million.

Junior Subordinated Debt

The Company sponsors 
five

          business trusts, CNBF Capital Trust I, NBT Statutory Trust I, NBT Statutory Trust II, Alliance Financial Capital Trust I and Alliance Financial Capital Trust II (collectively, the “Trusts”). The Company’s junior subordinated debentures include
          amounts related to the Company’s NBT Statutory Trust I and II as well as junior subordinated debentures associated with 
one
 statutory
          trust affiliate that was acquired from our merger with CNB Financial Corp. and 
two
 statutory trusts that were acquired from our
          acquisition of Alliance Financial Corporation (“Alliance”). The Trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing company-obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities to third-party investors and investing in the proceeds from the sale
          of such preferred securities solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the Company for general corporate purposes. The Company guarantees, on a limited basis, payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on
          redemption of the trust preferred securities. The Trusts are VIEs for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, as defined by GAAP. In accordance with GAAP, the accounts of the Trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated
          financial statements. See Note 1 for additional information about the Company’s consolidation policy.

The debentures held by each trust are the sole assets of that trust. The Trusts hold, as their sole assets, junior subordinated debentures of
          the Company with face amounts totaling $
98.0
 million at December 31, 2024. The Company owns all of the common securities of the Trusts
          and has accordingly recorded $
3.2
 million in equity method investments classified as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets at
          December 31, 2024. The Company owns all of the common stock of the Trusts, which have issued trust preferred securities in conjunction with the Company issuing trust preferred debentures to the Trusts. The terms of the trust preferred debentures
          are substantially the same as the terms of the trust preferred securities.

As of December 31, 2024, the Trusts had the following trust preferred securities outstanding and held the following junior subordinated
          debentures of the Company (dollars in thousands):

The Company’s junior subordinated debentures are redeemable prior to the maturity date at our option upon each trust’s stated option repurchase
          dates and from time to time thereafter. These debentures are also redeemable in whole at any time upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust indenture. Our obligations under the debentures and related documents, taken
          together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the issuers’ obligations under the trust preferred securities. The Company owns all of the common stock of the Trusts, which have issued trust preferred securities in
          conjunction with the Company issuing trust preferred debentures to the Trusts. The terms of the trust preferred debentures are substantially the same as the terms of the trust preferred securities.

With respect to the Trusts, the Company has the right to defer payments of interest on the debentures issued to the Trusts at any time or from
          time to time for a period of up to 
ten
 consecutive semi-annual periods with respect to each deferral period. Under the terms of the
          debentures, if in certain circumstances there is an event of default under the debentures or the Company elects to defer interest on the debentures, the Company may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on
          its capital stock or purchase or acquire any of its capital stock.

Despite the fact that the Trusts are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, $
97
 million of the $
101
 million in trust preferred securities
          issued by these subsidiary trusts is included in the Tier 1 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the FRB (NBT Bank owns $
1.0

          million of CNBF Trust I securities). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 requires bank holding companies with assets greater than $
500
 million to be subject to the same capital requirements as insured depository institutions, meaning, for instance, that such bank holding companies will not be able to count trust
          preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010 as Tier 1 capital. The aforementioned Trusts are grandfathered with respect to this enactment based on their date of issuance.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that
        some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Based on available evidence, gross deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized and a valuation allowance was not deemed necessary at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties on the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company monitors changes in
          tax statutes and regulations to determine if significant changes will occur over the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2024, no
          significant changes to UTBs are projected; however, tax audit examinations are possible, 
but it is not reasonably possible to estimate when examinations in
            subsequent years will be completed
. The Company recognized $
0.6
 million and $
0.5
 million of interest expense related to UTBs in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As of December 31, 2024, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal tax examination by tax authorities for years prior to 2021. The tax years 
2017 to 2019
 are currently being audited by New York State.

Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Post-Retirement Plans

The Company has a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan (“the Plan”) covering substantially all of its employees at December 31, 2024. Benefits paid
      from the Plan are based on age, years of service, compensation and social security benefits and are determined in accordance with defined formulas. The Company’s policy is to fund the Plan in accordance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
      1974 standards. Assets of the Plan are invested in publicly traded stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Prior to January 1, 2000, the Plan was a traditional defined benefit plan based on final average compensation. On January 1, 2000, the Plan was
      converted to a cash balance plan with grandfathering provisions for existing participants. Effective March 1, 2013, the Plan was amended. Benefit accruals for participants who, as of January 1, 2000, elected to continue participating in the
      traditional defined benefit plan design were frozen as of March 1, 2013. In May 2013, the noncontributory, frozen, defined benefit pension plan assumed from Alliance in the acquisition was merged into the Plan. In addition to the Plan, the Company
      provides supplemental employee retirement plans to certain current and former executives. The Company also assumed supplemental retirement plans for former executives in the Alliance acquisition. These supplemental employee retirement plans and the
      Plan are collectively referred to herein as “Pension Benefits.”

92

Table

              of Contents

In addition, the Company provides certain health care benefits for retired employees. Benefits were accrued over the employees’ active service period. Only employees
      that were employed by the Company on or before January 1, 2000 are eligible to receive post-retirement health care benefits. The Plan is contributory for participating retirees, requiring participants to absorb certain deductibles and coinsurance
      amounts with contributions adjusted annually to reflect cost sharing provisions and benefit limitations called for in the Plan. Employees become eligible for these benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the Company. For
      eligible employees described above, the Company funds the cost of post-retirement health care as benefits are paid. The Company elected to recognize the transition obligation on a delayed basis over 
twenty years
. In addition, the Company assumed post-retirement medical life insurance benefits for certain Alliance employees, retirees and their spouses, if applicable, in the
      Alliance acquisition. These post-retirement benefits are referred to herein as “Other Benefits.”

Accounting standards require an employer to: (1) recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post-retirement plans, which is
      measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation, as an asset or liability in its balance sheet; (2) recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income;
      and (3) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of its year-end balance sheet.

The components of AOCI, which have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, related to pensions and other post-retirement benefits are

The Company made 
no
 voluntary contributions to the
      pension and other benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

For measurement purposes, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical and prescription drug benefits for fiscal year 2024 were assumed to be 
7.0
% to 
12.0
%. The rates were assumed to
      decrease gradually to 
4.5
% for fiscal year 2034 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
      significant effect on amounts reported for health care plans.

Plan Investment Policy

The Company’s key investment objectives in managing its defined benefit plan assets are to ensure that present and future benefit obligations to all participants and
      beneficiaries are met as they become due; to provide a total return that, over the long-term, maximizes the ratio of the plan assets to liabilities, while minimizing the present value of required Company contributions, at the appropriate levels of
      risk; to meet statutory requirements and regulatory agencies’ requirements; and to satisfy applicable accounting standards. The Company periodically evaluates the asset allocations, funded status, rate of return assumption and contribution strategy
      for satisfaction of our investment objectives. 

The target and actual allocations expressed as a percentage of the defined benefit pension plan’s assets are as follows:

Determination of Assumed Rate of Return

The expected long-term rate-of-return on assets was 
6.7
%
      at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected
      benefit obligation. The assumption has been determined by reflecting expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset distribution and related historical rates of return. The appropriateness of the assumption is
      reviewed annually.

Employee 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plans

The Company maintains a 401(k) and employee stock ownership plan (the “401(k) Plan”). The Company contributes to the 401(k) Plan based on employees’ contributions out of
      their annual salaries. In addition, the Company may also make discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan based on profitability. Participation in the 401(k) Plan is contingent upon certain age and service requirements. The employer contributions
      associated with the 401(k) Plan were $
4.9
 million in 2024, $
4.4
 million in 2023 and $
4.0
 million in 2022.

Other Retirement Benefits

Included in other liabilities is $
0.6
 million and $
0.9
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for supplemental retirement benefits for retired executives from legacy plans assumed in
      acquisitions. The Company recognized $
0.1
 million in 2024, $
0.2
 million in 2023 and $
0.2
 million in 2022, related to these plans.

Stock-Based Compensation

In May 2024, the Company adopted the NBT Bancorp Inc. 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Stock Plan”) replacing the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Under the terms of the
      Stock Plan, equity-based awards are granted to directors and employees to increase their direct proprietary interest in the operations and success of the Company. The Stock Plan assumed all prior equity-based incentive plans and any new equity-based
      awards are granted under the terms of the Stock Plan. 
Restricted shares granted under the Plan typically vest after 
three
 or 
five years
 for employees and 
one year
 for non-employee directors. Restricted
      stock units granted under the Stock Plan may have different terms and conditions. Performance shares and units granted under the Stock Plan for executives may have different terms and conditions. Since 2011, the Company primarily grants restricted
      stock unit awards. Stock option grants since that time were reloads of existing grants which terminate 
ten years
 from the date of the 
grant. 
Under
          terms of the Stock Plan, stock options are granted to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Shares issued as a result of vesting of restricted stock
          unit awards and stock option exercises are funded from the Company’s treasury stoc
k.

The Company has outstanding restricted stock granted from various plans at December 31, 2024. The Company recognized $
6.0
 million, $
5.1
 million and $
4.5
 million in
        stock-based compensation expense related to these stock awards for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Tax
        benefits recognized with respect to restricted stock units were $
1.5
 million, $
1.3
 million and $
1.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units totaled $
6.0
 million at December 31, 2024 and will be recognized over 
1.4
 years on a weighted average basis. Shares issued are funded from the Company’s treasury stock. The following table summarizes information for

Certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends. The approval of the OCC is required to pay
      dividends when a bank fails to meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards or when such dividends are in excess of a subsidiary bank’s earnings retained in the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding 
two years
 as specified in applicable OCC regulations. At December 31, 2024, approximately $
107.6
 million of the total stockholders’ equity of the Bank
      was available for payment of dividends to the Company without approval by the OCC. The Bank’s ability to pay dividends also is subject to the Bank being in compliance with regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is currently in compliance with
      these requirements. Under the State of Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company may declare and pay dividends either out of accumulated net retained earnings or capital surplus.

The Company purchased 
7,600
 shares of its common stock
      during the year ended December 31, 2024, 
for a
        total of $
0.3
 million at an average price of $
33.02
 per share under its previously announced share repurchase
        program.
 On 
December 18, 
2023, the Board of Directors
      (“Board”) authorized a repurchase program for the Company to repurchase up to

2,000,000

shares

      of the outstanding shares of its common stock. The Company did 
no
t purchase any shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter of
      2024. The Company may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time to mitigate the potential dilutive effects of stock-based incentive plans and other potential uses of common stock for corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
1,992,400
 shares
      available for repurchase under this plan authorized on December 18, 2023, which is set to expire on December 31, 2025
.

15.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
      requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the
      regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of NBT Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting
      practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the
      table below) of total and Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 
In addition to maintaining minimum capital ratios, the
        Company is subject to a capital conservation buffer (“Buffer”) of 2.50% above the minimum to avoid restriction on capital distributions and discretionary bonus paychecks to officers. At 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023, the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.

Under their prompt corrective action regulations, regulatory authorities are required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions)
      with respect to an undercapitalized institution. Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution’s financial statements. The regulations establish a framework for the classification of banks into five categories: well-capitalized,
      adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the most recent notifications from the Bank’s regulators categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt
      corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 Capital to Average Asset ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that
      notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.

In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) announced an interim final rule
          to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the regulatory capital impact of the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date adjustment to the allowance for
          credit losses (after-tax) has been deferred and will phase into regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, the Company was allowed to defer the regulatory capital impact of the allowance for
          credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pre-tax) recognized through earnings for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustment to the allowance for credit
          losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, will also phase into regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.
 The Company adopted the
            capital transition relief over the permissible 
five-year
 period
.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

The Company’s concentrations of credit risk are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. The concentrations of credit risk with standby letters of credit, unused
      lines of credit, commitments to originate new loans and loans sold with recourse generally follow the loan classifications.

At December 31, 2024, approximately 
64
% of the Company’s
      loans were secured by real estate located in upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, Vermont, southern Maine and central and northwestern Connecticut. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a
      substantial portion of the Company’s portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions of those areas. Management is not aware of any material concentrations of credit to any industry or individual borrowers.

The Company is a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
      financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit, standby letters of credit and certain agricultural real estate loans sold to investors with recourse, with the sold portion having a government guarantee that is
      assignable back to the Company upon repurchase of the loan in the event of default. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit, standby letters
      of credit and loans sold with recourse is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved
      with extending loans to customers and is subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be obtained based on management’s assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness.

Since many loan commitments, standby letters of credit and guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts
      are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. The Company does not issue any guarantees that would require liability-recognition or disclosure, other than its standby letters of credit.

The Company guarantees the obligations or performance of customers by issuing standby letters of credit to third-parties. These standby letters of
      credit are generally issued in support of third-party debt, such as corporate debt issuances, industrial revenue bonds and municipal securities. The risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk
      involved in extending loan facilities to customers and letters of credit are subject to the same credit origination, portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit and off-balance sheet products. Typically, these
      instruments have 
one year
 expirations with an option to renew upon annual review; therefore, the total amounts do not necessarily
      represent future cash requirements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company’s standby letters of credit was not significant.

In the normal course of business there are various outstanding legal proceedings. If legal costs are deemed material by management, the Company accrues for the estimated
      loss from a loss contingency if the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide
      variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its assets and liabilities and
      through the use of derivative instruments. Specifically, the Company  may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash
      amounts, the value of which is determined by interest rates. Generally, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or
      expected cash payments. Currently, the Company has interest rate derivatives resulting from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company’s assets or liabilities. The
      Company manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

The
          Company enters into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These swaps are considered derivatives, but are not designated as hedging relationships. These instruments have interest rate and credit
          risk associated with them. To mitigate the interest rate risk, the Company enters into offsetting interest rate swaps with counterparties. The counterparty swaps are also considered derivatives and are also not designated as hedging
          relationships. Interest rate swaps are recorded within other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value. Changes to the fair value of assets and liabilities arising from these derivatives are
          included, net, in other operating income in the consolidated statements of income.

The Company is subject
        to over-the-counter derivative clearing requirements, which require certain derivatives to be cleared through central clearing houses. Accordingly, the Company clears certain derivative transactions through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Clearing
        House (“CME”). The CME requires the Company to post initial and variation margin payments to mitigate the risk of non-payment, the latter of which is received or paid daily based on the net asset or liability position of the contracts. A daily
        settlement occurs through the CME for changes in the fair value of centrally cleared derivatives. Not all of the derivatives are required to be cleared through the daily clearing agent. As a result, the total fair values of loan level derivative
        assets and liabilities recognized on the Company’s financial statements are not equal and offsetting.

In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
          announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of
 London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
 after 2021. In 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates
          based on SOFR that replaced LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. In 2023, the Company transitioned all of its financial instruments to an alternative benchmark rate.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
twenty

      and 
twelve
 risk participation agreements, respectively, with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to
      participated loans. Risk participation agreements provide credit protection to the financial institution that originated the swap transaction should the borrower fail to perform on its obligation. The Company enters into both risk participation
      agreements in which it purchases credit protection from other financial institutions and those in which it provides credit protection to other financial institutions.

Netting adjustments represents the amounts recorded to convert

                between counterparties as settlements of the outstanding derivative contracts instead of cash collateral.

(2)

Cash collateral represents the amount that cannot be used to offset our
                derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The other collateral consists of securities and is exchanged under bilateral collateral and master netting agreements
                that allow us to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral. The application of the other collateral cannot reduce the net derivative position below zero. Therefore, excess other collateral, if any, is not reflected
                above.

Fair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Instruments

GAAP states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
        between market participants. Fair value measurements are not adjusted for transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy exists within GAAP that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
        priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described
        below:

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable, either
        directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no
        market activity).

A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most U.S. government and agency securities, many other sovereign government
        obligations, liquid mortgage products, active listed equities and most money market securities. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company does not adjust the quoted prices for such
        instruments.

The types of instruments valued based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations or quote from alternative pricing sources with
        reasonable levels of price transparency include most investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, less liquid mortgage products, less liquid agency securities, less liquid listed equities, state, municipal and provincial obligations and certain
        physical commodities. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain common equity securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs (exchange quoted prices). Other investment securities
        are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The prices for Level 2 instruments are obtained through an independent pricing service or dealer market participants with whom the Company has historically transacted both purchases
        and sales of investment securities. Prices obtained from these sources include prices derived from market quotations and matrix pricing. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash
        flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and conditions, among other things. Management reviews the methodologies used by its
        third-party providers in pricing the securities.

Level 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions. Valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or
        non-transferability and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate will be used. Management’s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on
        certain Level 3 investments. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying
        investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets and changes in financial ratios or cash flows.

GAAP requires disclosure of assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair
          value on a non-recurring basis such as goodwill, loans held for sale, OREO, collateral-dependent loans individually evaluated for expected credit losses and HTM securities. Loans with fair value of $
28.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 were individually evaluated for expected credit losses where the amortized cost was adjusted to fair value. There were 
no
 loans individually evaluated for expected credit losses where the amortized cost was adjusted to fair value as of December 31, 2023. The Company
          uses the fair value of underlying collateral, less costs to sell, to estimate the allowance for credit losses for individually evaluated collateral dependent loans. The appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as
          economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses ranging from 
10
% to 
50
%. Based on the valuation techniques used, the fair value measurements for collateral dependent individually evaluated loans are classified as Level 3.

The following table sets forth information with regard to estimated fair values of financial instruments. This table excludes financial instruments for which the
        carrying amount approximates fair value. Financial instruments for which the fair value approximates carrying value include cash and cash equivalents, AFS securities, equity securities, AIR, non-maturity deposits, short-term borrowings, accrued
        interest payable and derivatives.

Table

              of Contents

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not
        reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair
        value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
        uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Fair value estimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and
        the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, the Company has a substantial wealth operation that contributes net fee income annually. The wealth management operation is not considered a financial
        instrument and its value has not been incorporated into the fair value estimates. Other significant assets and liabilities include the benefits resulting from the low-cost funding of deposit liabilities as compared to the cost of borrowing funds in
        the market and premises and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimate of fair
        value.

HTM Securities

The fair value of the Company’s HTM securities is primarily measured using information from a third-party pricing service. The fair value measurements consider
        observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and conditions, among
        other things.

Net Loans

Net loans include portfolio loans and loans held for sale. Loans were first segregated by type and then further segmented into fixed and variable
        rate and loan quality categories. Expected future cash flows were projected based on contractual cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments, and those expected future cash flows also includes credit risk, illiquidity risk and other market
        factors to calculate the exit price fair value in accordance with ASC 820.

Time Deposits

The fair value of time deposits was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach that applies prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity instruments. The
        fair values of the Company’s time deposit liabilities do not take into consideration the value of the Company’s long-term relationships with depositors, which may have significant value.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach that applies prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity instruments.

Subordinated Debt

The fair value of subordinated debt has been measured using the observable market price as of the period reported.

Junior Subordinated Debt

The fair value of junior subordinated debt has been estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.

Segment Reporting

Historically, the Company operated as a 
single
 reportable segment, providing a full range of banking services to retail and commercial customers. However, in accordance with ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, and as the Bank has grown, management has reassessed its operating segment structure to enhance transparency in how financial performance is evaluated
        and resources are allocated by the CODM. The updated guidance enhances disclosures by requiring more detailed information on segment profitability and certain key performance metrics used by management. Segments are components of an enterprise that
        are regularly evaluated by the CODM to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer.

As a result of this reassessment, as disclosed in Note 1, beginning with the fiscal
        year ended December 31, 2024, the Bank has determined that it now operates through 
two
 reportable segments:

Banking 
– Provides commercial banking, retail banking, and wealth management services primarily to customers in its market area, offering a broad array of banking and financial services to retail,
          commercial, and municipal customers. Included in Banking is the revenue and expenses from
 the wealth management business and the parent
 holding company. The parent company’s
          principal activities include the direct and indirect ownership of banking and non-banking subsidiaries, as well as the issuance of debt and equity. The parent company’s principal sources of revenue are the management fees and dividends it
          receives from its subsidiaries. Banking also includes corporate shared service costs such as the majority of equity compensation expense, as well as other general and administrative shared services costs including pension, retirement plan and
          supplemental retirement plan
 costs. Currently there is no allocation of these costs to other operating segments.

Our CODM reviews actual net income versus budgeted net income to assess segment
        performance and to make decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments. The CODM regularly receives expense information at a level consistent with that disclosed in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.

Reported segments and their financial information are not necessarily comparable to
        similar information reported by other financial institutions. Additionally, due to interrelationships among the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform as independent entities. Changes in
        management structure, allocation methodologies, or procedures may result in future revisions to previously reported segment financial data.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company only disclosed 
one
 reportable segment, as operations were assessed on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, prior year segment data has been retrospectively adjusted
        to conform to the current period presentation. The Company will continue to evaluate its segment disclosures in accordance with ASU 2023-07 and make necessary adjustments as business operations evolve.

Information about reportable segments and reconciliation of the information to the
        consolidated financial statements follows:

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and
                  Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
                  Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. No changes were made to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred
                  during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of NBT Bancorp Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
                    control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance
                    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial
                  reporting established in “Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013),” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment,
                  management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report
                  on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
                  of December 31, 2024, is included in this Item under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” on the following page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

NBT Bancorp Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited NBT Bancorp Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
                  over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
                  Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December
                  31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes
                  (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
                  reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a
                  public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
                  internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
                  that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
                  circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
                  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
                  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
                  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
                  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
                  are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
