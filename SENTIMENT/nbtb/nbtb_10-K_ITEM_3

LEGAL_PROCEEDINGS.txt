ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

The common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “NBTB.” The closing price of the Common Stock on
            January 31, 2025 was $47.63. As of January 31, 2025, there were 5,194 stockholders of record of Common Stock. No unregistered securities were sold by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Stock Performance Graph

The following stock performance graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return (i.e., price change, reinvestment of cash dividends and stock dividends received) on our Common Stock against
            the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Stock Market (U.S. Companies) Index and the KBW Regional Bank Index (Peer Group). The stock performance graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2019. The graph further assumes the
            reinvestment of dividends into additional shares of the same class of equity securities at the frequency with which dividends are paid on such securities during the relevant fiscal year. The yearly points marked on the horizontal axis
            correspond to December 31 of that year. We calculate each of the referenced indices in the same manner. All are market-capitalization-weighted indices, so companies judged by the market to be more important (i.e., more valuable) count for more
            in all indices.

Dividends

The Company depends primarily upon dividends from subsidiaries for a substantial part of its revenue. Accordingly, the ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends primarily upon the receipt
            of dividends or other capital distributions from the subsidiaries. Payment of dividends to the Company from the Bank is subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions. Under OCC regulations, the Bank may pay dividends to the Company
            without prior regulatory approval so long as it meets its applicable regulatory capital requirements before and after payment of such dividends and its total dividends do not exceed its net income to date over the calendar year plus retained
            net income over the preceding two years. At December 31, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with all applicable minimum capital requirements and had the ability to pay dividends of $107.6 million to the Company without the prior approval of the
            OCC.

If the capital of the Company is diminished by depreciation in the value of its property or by losses, or otherwise, to an amount less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the
            issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets, no dividends may be paid out of net profits until the deficiency in the amount of capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all
            classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets has been repaired. See the section captioned “Supervision and Regulation” in
