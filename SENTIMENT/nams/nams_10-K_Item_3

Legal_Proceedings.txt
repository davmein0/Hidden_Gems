SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about the Company’s expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will” and “would,” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Examples of forward-looking statements in this Annual Report include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company’s disclosure concerning its operations, cash flows, financial position and dividend policy.

Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report and in any document incorporated by reference in this Annual Report may include, for example, statements about:

•
the potential liquidity and trading of the Company’s public securities;

•
the Company’s ability to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to it;

•
the efficacy and safety of the Company’s product candidate, obicetrapib, as well as potential reimbursement and anticipated market size and market opportunity;

•
the Company’s dependence on the success of obicetrapib, including the obtaining of regulatory approval to market obicetrapib;

•
the timing, progress and results of clinical trials for obicetrapib, including statements regarding the timing of initiation and completion of studies or trials and related preparatory work and the period during which results of trials will become available and marketing submissions made;

•
the Company’s ability to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel;

•
the Company’s limited experience in marketing or distributing products;

•
managing the risks related to the Company’s international operations;

•
the Company’s ability to achieve the broad degree of physician adoption and use and market acceptance necessary for commercial success;

•
the Company’s estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;

•
developments regarding the Company’s competitors and the Company’s industry;

•
the impact of government laws and regulations;

•
the Company’s reliance on third parties for all aspects of the manufacturing of obicetrapib for clinical trials; and

•
the Company’s efforts to obtain, protect or enforce its patents and other intellectual property rights related to the Company’s product candidate.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section titled “
Risk Factors
” in this Annual Report. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of this Annual Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as specifically required by law. You should, however, review the factors and risks that the Company describes in the reports it files from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect the Company’s beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to the Company as of the date of this Annual Report. And while the Company believes that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. The Company’s statements should not be read to indicate that it has conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and you are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.

Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements were reasonable at the time made, it cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. You should carefully consider the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report and any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that may be issued by the Company or persons acting on its behalf.

SUMMARY OF SELECTED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS

Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should carefully review and consider the full discussion of our risk factors in the section titled “
Risk Factors
” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report. Some of the more significant risks include the following:

Risks Related to Our Limited Operating History, Financial Condition and Capital Requirements

•
We are a clinical-stage company with limited operating history, no approved products and no historical product revenues, which makes it difficult to assess our future prospects and financial results. We have incurred net losses since our inception, and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate any product revenue or become profitable or, if we achieve profitability, may not be able to sustain it.

•
We may require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this capital when needed and on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, commercialization efforts or other operations.

Risks Related to Our Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization

•
We are dependent on the success of our only product candidate, obicetrapib, and cannot guarantee that obicetrapib will successfully complete clinical development, receive regulatory approval or, if approved, be successfully commercialized.

•
Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. Results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results and our clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of obicetrapib.

•
The regulatory approval processes of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) and other comparable regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for obicetrapib, our business will be substantially harmed.

•
Obicetrapib may produce undesirable side effects that we may not have detected in our previous preclinical studies and clinical trials. This could prevent us from gaining approval or market acceptance, including broad physician adoption, for our product candidate if approved, or from maintaining such approval and acceptance, and could substantially increase commercialization costs and even force us to cease operations.

•
We are developing obicetrapib in combination with other therapies, and safety of supply issues with combination products may delay or prevent development and approval of our combination product candidate.

•
Even if we receive regulatory approval for obicetrapib or our future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expenses, force us to limit or withdraw regulatory approval and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.

•
Obicetrapib, if approved, will face significant competition from competing therapies and our failure to compete effectively may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.

•
We currently intend to rely on our collaboration with A. Menarini International Licensing S.A., part of Menarini Group ("Menarini") for the commercialization of obicetrapib, if approved, in certain European areas. Failure or delay of Menarini to fulfill all or part of its obligations to us under the exclusive license agreement , dated June 23, 2022, with Menarini (the "Menarini License"), a breakdown in collaboration between the parties or a complete or partial loss of this relationship could materially harm our business if obicetrapib is approved in the relevant jurisdictions.

Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy

•
We have expanded and expect to continue expanding our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.

•
Our international operations subject us to various risks, and our failure to manage these risks could adversely affect our results of operations; we may also be exposed to significant foreign exchange risk.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property

•
We may not be successful in obtaining all of the necessary intellectual property rights to allow us to develop and commercialize our product candidate, obicetrapib. If our efforts to obtain, protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights related to our product candidates and technologies are not adequate, including due to the risk that we are unaware of prior art that may affect the validity of our patents, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market and we otherwise may be harmed.

5

•
Third-party claims alleging intellectual property infringement may adversely affect our business, and we may be subject to lawsuits claiming that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could be expensive and time consuming, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, or subject future sales to royalty payments, which could damage our business.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities

•
Sales of a substantial number of our securities in the public market by certain of our securityholders pursuant to a registration statement we filed and/or by our existing securityholders could cause the price of our Ordinary Shares and our warrants, each representing the right to purchase one Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50, to fall.

•
We no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” as of December 31, 2024 and, as a result, we are no longer able to avail ourselves of certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and therefore expect to incur increased expenses due to increased disclosure requirements.
