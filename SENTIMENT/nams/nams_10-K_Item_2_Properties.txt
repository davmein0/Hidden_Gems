Item 2. Properties

We have our corporate headquarters at Gooimeer 2-35, 1411 DC, Naarden, the Netherlands, where we lease a small office space pursuant to a lease agreement entered into on July 3, 2020 which will continue until terminated by either us or the landlord upon one-month prior written notice. This facility houses our operations, human resources, information technology, finance, clinical operations and program management functions.

We also lease an administrative office of approximately 1,375 square feet, located at 20803 Biscayne Blvd., Suite #105, Aventura, FL 33180. This office space houses our U.S. administration, human resources, information technology, finance, clinical operations and program management functions.

We believe that these existing facilities will be adequate for our near-term needs. If required, we believe that suitable additional or alternative space would be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms. We are not aware of any environmental issues or other constraints that would materially impact the intended use of our facilities.
