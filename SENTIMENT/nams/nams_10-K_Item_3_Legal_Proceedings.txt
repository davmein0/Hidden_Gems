Overview

We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to improve patient care in populations with cardiometabolic diseases where currently approved therapies have not been adequate or well tolerated. We seek to fill a significant unmet need for a safe, well tolerated and convenient LDL-C lowering therapy. In multiple Phase 3 trials, we have investigated obicetrapib, an oral, low-dose, once-daily, highly selective CETP inhibitor, alone or as a fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe, as preferred LDL-C lowering therapies to be used as an adjunct to statin therapy for patients at risk of CVD with elevated LDL-C, for whom existing therapies are not sufficiently effective or well tolerated. We believe that CETP inhibition may also play a role in other indications by potentially mitigating the risk of developing diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.

Obicetrapib, is a next-generation, oral, low-dose, highly selective CETP inhibitor that we are developing to potentially overcome the limitations of current LDL-C lowering treatments. In addition to LDL-C, obicetrapib has shown significant reductions in Lp(a) and small LDL particles, all with safety comparable to placebo. We believe that obicetrapib has the potential to be a once-daily oral CETP inhibitor for lowering LDL-C, if approved. In each of our Phase 3 clinical trials, BROADWAY and BROOKLYN, evaluating obicetrapib as an adjunct to high-intensity statin therapy, obicetrapib met its primary and secondary endpoints, with statistically significant reductions in LDL-C observed. In our Phase 3 TANDEM clinical trial, evaluating obicetrapib in combination with ezetimibe as an adjunct to high-intensity statin therapy, obicetrapib in combination with ezetimibe met its primary and secondary endpoints, with statistically significant reductions in LDL-C observed. In five of our Phase 2 clinical trials, TULIP, ROSE, OCEAN, ROSE2 and our Japan Phase 2b clinical trial, evaluating obicetrapib as a monotherapy or a combination therapy with ezetimibe 10 mg, we observed statistically significant LDL-C lowering with side effects similar in frequency and severity to placebo including muscle-related side effects and drug-related TESAEs. We have observed obicetrapib to be well tolerated in an aggregate of over 3,500 patients with dyslipidemia in our clinical trials to date. Furthermore, we believe that obicetrapib’s oral delivery, demonstrated activity at low doses, chemical properties and tolerability make it well-suited for combination approaches.

Lowering of LDL-C, has been associated with MACE benefit in trials of LDL-C lowering drugs, including the REVEAL trial with the CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib. In our Phase 3 BROADWAY clinical trial we observed a positive trend in the exploratory MACE endpoint and we are performing a Phase 3 CVOT PREVAIL trial to reconfirm this relationship.

Obicetrapib has shown to not only reduce LDL-C but also several additional biomarkers associated with MACE. To date, obicetrapib has shown reductions in non-HDL-C, ApoB, and sdLDL-P. In our clinical trials, we have also observed reductions in Lp(a), which is believed to be an independent MACE risk factor, along with reductions in total LDL particles and more specifically small LDL particles, which are believed to be more atherogenic particles.

CVD is a leading cause of death worldwide. ASCVD is primarily caused by atherosclerosis, which involves the build-up of fatty material within the inner walls of the arteries. Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of heart attacks, strokes and peripheral vascular disease. One of the most important risk factors for ASCVD is hypercholesterolemia, which refers to elevated LDL-C levels within the body, commonly known as high cholesterol.

A significant proportion of patients with high cholesterol do not achieve acceptable LDL-C levels using statin therapy alone. We estimate that in the United States there are approximately 30 million patients that are not at their risk-based LDL-C goals despite treatment with lipid lowering therapy, including approximately 13 million with ASCVD. Existing non-statin treatment options have been largely unable to address the needs of patients with high cholesterol due to limited efficacy, an inconvenient injectable administration route and, in the past, market access restrictions. It is estimated that over 75% of ASCVD and HeFH outpatients prefer oral drugs to injectable therapies.

Our goal is to develop and commercialize an LDL-C lowering monotherapy and a fixed-dose combination therapy, which offers the advantage of a single, low dose, once-daily oral pill, and fulfills the significant unmet need for an effective and convenient LDL-C lowering therapy. If we obtain marketing approval, we intend to commercialize obicetrapib for patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH and elevated levels of LDL-C despite being treated with currently available optimal lipid lowering therapy.

We have partnered with Menarini, providing them with the exclusive rights to commercialize obicetrapib 10 mg, either as a sole active ingredient product or in a fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe, in the majority of European countries, if approved. Subject to receipt of marketing approval, our current plan is to pursue development and commercialization of obicetrapib in the United States ourselves, and to consider additional partners for jurisdictions outside of the United States and the EU, including in Japan and China. In addition to our partnership with Menarini, we may in the future utilize a variety of types of collaboration, license, monetization, distribution and other

90

arrangements with other third parties relating to the development or commercialization, once approved, of obicetrapib or future product candidates or indications. We are also continually evaluating the potential acquisition or license of new product candidates.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $771.7 million as compared to $340.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash is primarily driven by the proceeds of the February 2024 Offering (as defined below), the December 2024 Offering (as defined below), Warrant exercises, exercises of options and the achievement of a clinical development milestone, partially offset by cash outflows related to research and development costs as we continue development of obicetrapib and increased spending on selling, general and administrative expenses to support our growing organization.. As of December 31, 2024, we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company,” and, as a result, we are no longer able to avail ourselves of certain reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, and we expect to incur increased expenses as a result.

Recent Developments

December 2024 Follow-On Offering

On December 13, 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering (the “December 2024 Offering”) of 14,667,347 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $24.50 per Ordinary Share and, in lieu of Ordinary Shares to certain investors, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 4,882,653 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $24.4999 per Pre-Funded Warrant, which represents the per share public offering price for the Ordinary Shares, less the $0.0001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant. Of the 14,667,347 Ordinary Shares issued and sold in the offering, 2,550,000 Ordinary Shares were issued and sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Ordinary Shares at the public offering price per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the December 2024 Offering were $453.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.

Positive Topline Data from Pivotal Phase 3 BROADWAY Clinical Trial

On December 10, 2024, we announced positive topline data from our Phase 3 BROADWAY clinical trial. The primary endpoint was the least-squares mean of the percent change in LDL-C from baseline to day 84 for obicetrapib 10 mg compared to placebo, using imputation for missing data. The primary endpoint was achieved with statistical significance with an LDL-C reduction of 33% (p<0.0001). As part of the safety analysis, the trial adjudicated MACE as an exploratory endpoint, including death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and coronary revascularization. In addition, a 21% reduction in MACE favoring obicetrapib was observed. The observed changes in other biomarkers, including HDL-C, non-HDL-C, Lp(a), ApoB, and Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) were consistent with data reported in our prior clinical trials. As part of the safety analysis, key AEs of special interests were monitored. Among these AEs, glycemic control and renal function were monitored and each of the events favored obicetrapib. Overall, obicetrapib was also observed to be well-tolerated, with safety results, including blood pressure, comparable to placebo.

Positive Topline Data from Pivotal Phase 3 TANDEM Clinical Trial

On November 20, 2024, we announced positive topline data from our Phase 3 TANDEM clinical trial. The co-primary endpoints were percent change from baseline in LDL-C of the fixed-dose combination compared to each monotherapy arm after 84 days and obicetrapib 10 mg compared to placebo after day 84. Secondary endpoints incorporated percent changes from baseline in other biomarkers, including Lp(a), non-HDL-C and ApoB. The TANDEM trial met all co-primary endpoints, including the obicetrapib-ezetimibe fixed dose combination achieving an LS mean reduction of 48.6% (p < 0.0001) compared to placebo at day 84. In the trial, the fixed-dose combination of obicetrapib and ezetimibe was observed to be well tolerated, with safety results comparable to placebo.

Positive Topline Data from Pivotal Phase 3 BROOKLYN Clinical Trial

On November 18, 2024, we announced additional positive data from our Phase 3 BROOKLYN clinical trial. The trial met its primary endpoint of percent change from baseline in LDL-C of obicetrapib 10 mg compared to placebo after 84 days. The trial also met several of its prespecified secondary endpoints with statistical significance and observed results consistent with our prior clinical trials. Key secondary endpoints included percent changes from baseline of obicetrapib 10 mg compared to placebo after 84 days in Lp(a), ApoB, HDL-C and non-HDL-C. The p-value for the LS mean for all secondary endpoints compared to placebo was <0.0001 following 84 days of treatment with obicetrapib. Obicetrapib was also observed to be well tolerated, with safety results in the treatment arm comparable to placebo and no observed increase in blood pressure.

Components of our Results of Operations

Revenue

To date, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products. Our revenue has been solely derived from our license agreement with Menarini. Two performance obligations for the Menarini license were identified at contract inception, comprising a license to use the Company's intellectual property (the "license performance obligation") and a promise to continue the development activities for the licensed compound (the "R&D performance obligation"). Pursuant to the Menarini License, we received a non-refundable, non-creditable upfront amount of $120.9 million (€115.0 million) from Menarini on July 7, 2022, of which $98.6 million (€93.5 million) was

91

attributed to the license performance obligation and recognized as revenue upon the execution of the Menarini License on June 23, 2022. The remaining $22.3 million (€21.5 million) was attributed to the R&D performance obligation and initially recognized as deferred revenue.

Additionally, in partial contribution to our costs of development of the Licensed Products, Menarini may pay us €27.5 million, payable in two equal annual installments. Due to the scientific uncertainties around the commercialization of the Licensed Products based on the success of clinical trials, which is out of our control, the fixed €27.5 million was considered constrained at contract execution and is not initially recognized within the transaction price until it becomes highly probable of no significant revenue reversal. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the probability of significant reversals for any amounts that become likely to be realized prior to recognizing the constrained amounts associated with these payments within the transaction price.

Under the Menarini License, we are also entitled to receive certain cost sharing payments, sales-based royalties and payments based upon the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercial milestones linked to the enhanced value of the license performance obligation. These milestones are contingent payments and represent variable considerations that are not initially recognized within the transaction price, due to the scientific uncertainties around the commercialization of the Licensed Products based on the success of clinical trials. Our ability to receive and generate revenue from these payments is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully complete the development of and obtain regulatory approval for obicetrapib within the Menarini Territory. The uncertainty of achieving these milestones significantly impacts our ability to generate revenue. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the probability of significant reversals for any amounts that become likely to be realized prior to recognizing the variable consideration associated with these payments within the transaction price.

We do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future. Any revenue generated from potential future collaborations may vary due to the many uncertainties in the development of obicetrapib and other factors.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are recognized as an expense when incurred and are typically made up of costs from our clinical and preclinical activities, drug development and manufacturing costs, and costs for CROs and investigative sites. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data provided by vendors of their actual costs incurred. At each balance sheet date, we estimate the level of services provided by vendors and the associated expenditure incurred for the services performed.

All such costs are for the purpose of advancing our product candidate to successfully complete clinical development, attain regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialize our product candidate. Much of our current focus in our ongoing trials is on patient recruitment and retention and data cleaning. Research and development expenses consist of the following:

•
clinical expenses primarily incurred by CROs assisting with our sponsored clinical trials and including clinical investigator costs, patient enrollments and costs of clinical sites;

•
manufacturing expenses arising from API and drug product development as performed by our CMOs, which are used in our clinical trials and research and development activities;

•
costs associated with obtaining potential regulatory approval of our product candidate, including preparation and submission of filings, ongoing monitoring and compliance with comments and recommendations provided by regulatory authorities, and regulatory-related advisory fees;

•
contracted personnel and employment costs attributed to research and development efforts, which includes management fees, salaries, share-based compensation expenses, bonus plans and payments to contractors who work for us for a fixed number of hours per week or per month;

•
preclinical and nonclinical research and development expenses of the product candidate; and

•
other clinical costs such as clinical trial insurance and other consultancy fees.

We expect our research and development expenses to be significant as we advance obicetrapib through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval. The process of conducting the necessary clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. Clinical trials generally become larger and more costly to conduct as they advance into later stages and, in the future, we will be required to make estimates for expense accruals related to clinical trial expenses. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of obicetrapib. See the section entitled “
Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization
” for more information regarding the risks associated with clinical development.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

92

We recognize selling, general and administrative expenses on the accrual basis when incurred. These expenses mainly relate to consultant fees, employee costs, legal costs, marketing and communication, intellectual property costs due to increased efforts to drug patent development and protection globally, and general overhead costs.

Due to the general growth of the organization associated with administering ongoing and planned clinical trials and our focus on commercial preparedness, we expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses may increase. We will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company. Additionally, if and when a regulatory approval of a product candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations.

Interest Income

Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method. Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2024 is related to interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Net Foreign Exchange Gain/Loss

Our exchange gain/loss relates mainly to cash balances denominated in foreign currencies, but also to transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposure is mainly related to the Euro. As of December 31, 2024, our net exposure to foreign currency risk was $108.6 million compared to $114.3 million as of December 31, 2023, mainly related to the Euro.

Income Tax

We have a history of losses and therefore have de minimis amounts of corporate tax. We expect to continue incurring losses as we continue to invest in our clinical and preclinical development programs. Consequently, any deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance on our balance sheet.

Revenue

Revenue increased by $31.5 million, or 223.4%, to $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This change is largely due to $27.3 million of revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the license performance obligation under the Menarini License for a clinical success milestone compared to $5.4 million of such revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023. The remainder of the change is due to an increase of $9.5 million in the revenue recognized related to the R&D performance obligation in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase in revenue related to the R&D performance obligation is composed of the following:

•
recognition of $11.9 million of revenue for a general development cost reimbursement in the year ended December 31, 2024 while no such cost reimbursement was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023; and

•
an offsetting decrease of $2.3 million in recognition of deferred revenues in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to differences in the percentage of completion achieved in each respective year related to the performance obligation.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses decreased by $8.0 million, or 5.0%, to $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $159.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by:

•
a $10.2 million decrease in manufacturing costs;

•
a $1.1 million decrease in non-clinical expenses related to preclinical studies;

•
a $0.9 million decrease in clinical expenses due to clinical trial which are complete or nearing completion;

•
a partially offsetting $0.9 million increase in regulatory expenses; and

•
a partially offsetting $3.1 million increase in personnel expenses.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $32.8 million, or 87.2%, to $70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by:

•
a $25.9 million increase in personnel expenses related to selling, general and administrative expenses, of which our share-based compensation arrangements account for $10.3 million. The remainder is largely due to increased recruitment and employment costs for individuals involved with administrative and commercial preparedness activities to support the growth of the organization;

•
a $10.9 million increase in marketing and communication expenses related to startup costs as we begin to build capabilities to support our planned commercial launch of obicetrapib, if approved; and

•
a partially offsetting $3.5 million decrease in finance and administration expenses primarily due to costs incurred in 2023 in connection with an underwritten public offering of Ordinary Shares by certain of our shareholders. We did not sell any Ordinary Shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering.

Interest Income

Interest income increased by $5.6 million, to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by greater cash balances and investments in marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Fair Value Change - Earnout

Fair value change - earnout was a loss of $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change is driven by changes in the market price during the period for Ordinary Shares and an increase in the estimated probability of achieving the earnout milestone from 40% as of December 31, 2023 to 100% as of December 31, 2024.

Fair Value Change - Warrants

Fair value change - warrants was a loss of $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a loss of $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change is driven by changes in the market price during the period for the Warrants, which trade under the symbol "NAMSW."

Foreign Exchange Gains/(Losses)

Net foreign exchange gains/(losses) were a loss of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a gain of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This change was largely driven by a weakening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar.

94

Loss for the Year

Loss for the year increased by $64.7 million, to $241.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $176.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The individual components of the change are described above.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022

Please refer to the section titled “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a comparative discussion of our fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and, since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Since inception, we have not generated any product revenues or net positive cash flows from operating activities. We will not receive any product revenues or net positive cash flows from operating activities until we successfully develop a product candidate, obtain regulatory approval, and successfully commercialize it.

To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials of obicetrapib. As a result, we are not yet profitable and have incurred losses in each annual period since our inception. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated loss of $558.6 million. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will relate primarily to, and increase substantially as a result of:

•
the progress and costs of our discovery, preclinical and non-clinical development;

•
the progress and costs of our clinical trials, including costs related to clinical sites, clinical investigators and CROs that are assisting with our sponsored clinical trials, and other research and development activities;

•
the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approval, including the expenses of filing NDAs and MAAs, and the related expenses involved in validating our manufacturing processes;

•
the costs associated with any future investigator-sponsored preclinical studies and clinical trials;

•
the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent applications, claims, patents and other intellectual property rights;

•
the costs and timing of obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidate for clinical trials by establishing production capacities through contracts with CMOs;

•
the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;

•
compensation expenses associated with increased headcount;

•
the costs of preparing for launch and commercialization of our product candidate; 

•
losing our status as an emerging growth company; and

•
the costs of operating as a public company in the United States.

We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other factors that may adversely affect our business. The magnitude of our future net losses will depend on the rate of future growth of our expenses combined with our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and working capital unless and until eliminated by revenue generation and growth.

We have historically funded our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of shares, the sale of convertible notes, proceeds from the Menarini License and the proceeds from the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $771.7 million. Until we can generate substantial revenue, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, convertible loans, warrants, collaborations, or other means. We may consider raising additional capital to take advantage of favorable market conditions or for other strategic considerations even if we have sufficient funds for planned operations. In addition to our partnership with Menarini, we may in the future utilize a variety of types of collaboration, license, monetization, distribution and other arrangements with other third parties relating to the development or commercialization, once approved, of obicetrapib or future product candidates or indications. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or privately placed equity offerings of securities, the terms of these securities or offerings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our other shareholders’ rights. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing and selling equity or

95

equity-linked securities, shareholders will experience dilution. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we would likely be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, licensing or selling assets, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Capital may become difficult or impossible to obtain due to poor market or other conditions outside of our control. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds on favorable terms as and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others any of our potential future product candidates that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. See the section titled “
Risk Factors
” for additional detail regarding these risks.

We plan to utilize our existing cash and other financial assets on hand primarily to fund our research and development initiatives to continue or commence clinical trials and seek regulatory approval for obicetrapib. We also expect to make capital expenditures to support our anticipated growth. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy which has the primary purpose of capital preservation and liquidity. We are also continually evaluating the potential acquisition or license of new product candidates.

Sources of Liquidity

December 2024 Follow-on Offering

On December 13, 2024, we completed the December 2024 Offering of 14,667,347 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $24.50 per Ordinary Share and, in lieu of Ordinary Shares to certain investors, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 4,882,653 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $24.4999 per Pre-Funded Warrant, which represents the per share public offering price for the Ordinary Shares, less the $0.0001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant. Of the 14,667,347 Ordinary Shares issued and sold in the December 2024 Offering, 2,550,000 Ordinary Shares were issued and sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Ordinary Shares at the public offering price per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the December 2024 Offering were $453.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.

February 2024 Follow-on Offering

On February 16, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering (the “February 2024 Offering”) of 5,871,909 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $19.00 per Ordinary Share and, in lieu of Ordinary Shares to certain investors, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 4,736,841 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $18.9999 per Pre-Funded Warrant, which represents the per share public offering price for the Ordinary Shares less the $0.0001 per share exercise price for each such Pre-Funded Warrant. Of the 5,871,909 Ordinary Shares issued and sold in the February 2024 Offering, 1,383,750 Ordinary Shares were issued and sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional Ordinary Shares at the public offering price per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the February 2024 Offering were $190.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.

Menarini License

On June 23, 2022, we entered into the Menarini License, pursuant to which we granted Menarini an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain of our intellectual property and our regulatory documentation to undertake post approval development activities and commercialize the Licensed Products, for any use in the Menarini Territory. Pursuant to the Menarini License, Menarini made a non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment to us of €115 million. Menarini has also committed to providing us €27.5 million in funding for the research and development activities related to the Licensed Products over two years, together with bearing 50% of any development costs incurred in respect of the pediatric population in the Menarini Territory. We are also eligible to receive up to €863 million upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, €30 million of which has been received to date. If obicetrapib is approved, and successfully commercialized by Menarini, we will be entitled to tiered royalties ranging from the low double-digits to the mid-twenties as a percentage of net sales in the Menarini Territory, with royalty step-downs in the event of generic entrance or in respect of required third-party IP payments. See the section titled “
Business—Commercial
” for a full description of the Menarini License.

As of December 31, 2024, we have received a total of €30 million in milestone payments from Menarini, €25 million of which was received in the year ended December 31, 2024.

Warrants

In the year ended December 31, 2024, 1,384,640 Warrants were exercised at an exercise price of $11.50 per Ordinary Share, generating gross proceeds of $13.8 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had another 2,632,581 outstanding Warrants to purchase 2,632,581 Ordinary Shares, exercisable at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, which will expire on November 23, 2027, at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. Based on the exercise price of the Warrants, we may receive up to $30.3 million, assuming the exercise of all Warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The exercise of the Warrants, and any proceeds we may receive from their exercise, are highly dependent on the price of our Ordinary Shares and the spread between the exercise price of the Warrant and the price of an Ordinary Share at the time of exercise. For example, to the extent that the trading price of the Ordinary Shares exceeds $11.50 per share, it is more likely that holders of our Warrants will exercise their Warrants. If the trading price of the Ordinary Shares is less than $11.50 per share, it is unlikely that such holders will exercise their Warrants. The exercise price of the Warrants has at times exceeded the market price of the Ordinary Shares. To the extent that the price of our Ordinary Shares is below $11.50, we believe that the Warrant holders will be unlikely to cash exercise their warrants, resulting in little to

96

no cash proceeds to us. There can be no assurance that our Warrants will be in the money prior to their expiration and, as such, certain unexercised Warrants may expire worthless. As such, it is possible that we may never generate any additional cash proceeds from the exercise of our Warrants. We have not included, and do not intend to include, any potential cash proceeds from the exercise of our Warrants in our short-term or long-term liquidity projections. We will continue to evaluate the probability that the Warrants are exercised over the life of our Warrants and the merit of including potential cash proceeds from the exercise thereof in our liquidity projections.

Business Combination and PIPE Financing

In July 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement with FLAC, NewAmsterdam Pharma and Merger Sub, which closed on November 22, 2022.

Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, we and FLAC also entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (the "PIPE Investors"), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase from us, and we agreed to issue and sell to such PIPE Investors in a private placement, an aggregate of 23,460,000 Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $234.6 million (the "PIPE Financing"). The PIPE Financing closed substantially concurrently with the Business Combination.

We received an aggregate of $306.3 million from the Business Combination and associated PIPE Financing at the closing of the Business Combination, prior to deducting the $2.6 million of transaction costs directly attributable to these financing activities.

Net Cash Flows Provided By/Used In Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities increased by $17.4 million from $141.2 million in 2023 to $158.6 million in 2024. This change was primarily due to an increase in operating expenditures, the underlying reasons for which are described above, partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash received related to the achievement of clinical development milestones in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Net Cash Flows Provided By/Used In Investing Activities

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $62.8 million from $0.0 million in 2023 to $62.8 million in 2024. This change was primarily due to investments in marketable securities.

Net Cash Flows Provided By Financing Activities

Net cash flows provided by financing activities was $659.5 million in 2024 compared to $8.9 million in 2023, an increase of $650.6 million. This change was primarily related to the February 2024 Offering and the December 2024 Offering, which together generated net proceeds of $645.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by the Company. The remaining change is due to a $5.1 million increase in the proceeds received from the exercise of Warrants and a $0.5 increase in net proceeds from the exercise of options.

Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements

Third-Party Service Agreements

We have entered into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, and other third parties for preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing services. The terms generally provide us with the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Payments due upon cancellation generally consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. However, some of our service providers also charge cancellation fees upon cancellation. The amount and timing of such payments are not known, but at December 31, 2024 they are estimated to be a maximum of $11.8 million due within

97

one year and $2.4 million due in more than a year. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $771.7 million, which is sufficient to fund these obligations.

Leases

We are party to a services agreement (the "Naarden Lease") pursuant to which an affiliate of Forbion leased us office space; an office lease agreement with Renaissance Aventura LLC, dated May 24, 2021, as amended April 9, 2024 (as amended, the “Miami Lease”); and an office sublease agreement with GR8 People, Inc., dated April 2, 2024 (the “Yardley Lease”). Under the Naarden Lease, we are obligated to pay €40 thousand per year in rent. The Naarden Lease will continue until terminated by either us or the landlord. Pursuant to the Miami Lease, we are required to pay annual rent ranging from $75 thousand to $82 thousand, increasing from the low end of the range to the higher end of the range for each year of the lease. The Miami Lease will expire by its terms on October 31, 2027, unless terminated earlier by either party pursuant to the terms of the Miami Lease. Pursuant to the Yardley Lease, we are required to pay annual rent ranging from $189 thousand to $194 thousand, increasing from the low end of the range to the higher end of the range for each year of the lease. The Yardley Lease will expire by its terms on April 3, 2026, unless terminated earlier by either party pursuant to the terms of the Yardley Lease.

Menarini License

We will be responsible for the development and commercialization costs related to Licensed Products other than those in the Menarini Territory. In addition, under specified conditions of the agreement, we agreed to bear 50% of certain development costs incurred by the other party in the development of the Licensed Products in the Menarini Territory. Please see “
Business—Marketing and Sales
” above for a description of the Menarini License.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Prior to 2023, we prepared our financial statements in accordance with the IFRS as permitted in the United States based on our qualification as a foreign private issuer under the rules and regulations of the SEC. In connection with the loss of our status as a foreign private issuer effective on January 1, 2024, we, as a domestic filer, prepared our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The transition was made retrospectively for all periods from our inception.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates when there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. If actual results differ from our estimates, or to the extent these estimates are adjusted in future periods, our results of operations could either benefit from, or be adversely affected by, any such change in estimate.

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
 Disclosures About Market Risk

Our principal financial liabilities consist of trade and other payables lease liability, derivative warrant liabilities and derivative earnout liability. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance our day-to-day operations. Our financial assets consist of prepayments and other receivables and cash, that are derived from our operating activities and funding.

We are exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Our senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Board of Directors reviews and approves policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and other price risks.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expense resulting from short-term interest-bearing assets. We invest in high-quality financial instruments, primarily money market funds and U.S. government and agency securities with maturities of less than one year, which we believe are subject to limited credit risk. We regularly review our investments and monitor the financial markets and we do not currently hedge interest rate exposure. Due to the nature of our investments, we do not believe an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would have a

98

material effect on our financial condition. We do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk or changes in credit ratings arising from our investments.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to cash and trade and other payables denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the U.S. Dollar. As of December 31, 2024, our net exposure to foreign currency risk was $108.6 million, mainly related to the Euro. As of December 31, 2024, the effect of a hypothetical 1% change in exchange rates on currencies denominated in other than our functional currency would result in a potential change in future earnings in our consolidated statement of operations of approximately $1.1 million.

We partly manage our foreign currency risk by selectively holding foreign currency in our cash to offset foreign currency exposures from lease liabilities and trade and other payables. We plan to use this cash to settle future expenses we expect to incur in those foreign currencies.

Other Market Price Risk

As a result of the Business Combination, we have derivative warrant liabilities and a derivative earnout liability which are measured at fair value through profit or loss. As at December 31, 2024, the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities and the derivative earnout liability were $37.5 million and $44.8 million, respectively. The value of the derivative warrant liability is directly correlated to the market price of a publicly traded Warrant which is traded under the symbol NAMSW. With all other variables held constant, a 1% change in the market price of NAMSW would change the value of the derivative warrant liability by 1% or $0.4 million. The value of the derivative earnout liability is directly correlated to the market price of a publicly traded Ordinary Share which is traded under the symbol NAMS. With all other variables held constant, a 1% change in the market price of NAMS would change the value of the derivative earnout liability by 1% or $0.4 million.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. We are exposed to credit risk primarily from our treasury activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions and have limited credit risk exposure from our operating activities. We hold available cash in bank accounts with banks which have investment grade credit ratings. Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of the banks with which it holds assets.

We perform research and development activities and do not yet have any sales. We are able to reclaim VAT, which is recoverable from tax authorities. Management periodically reviews the recoverability of the balance of input value added tax and believes it is fully recoverable.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

99

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)", issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Remediation

As discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to:

•
a lack of consistent and documented risk assessment procedures and control activities related to financial reporting, with a sufficient level of management review and approval, and adequate application of controls over information technology; and

•
failure to maintain a sufficient complement of personnel commensurate with its accounting and reporting requirements as it continues to grow as a company, and ability to: (i) design and maintain formal accounting policies, including maintaining appropriate segregation of duties; (ii) design and maintain controls over the preparation and review of journal entries and financial statements, including the fair presentation and disclosure of complex accounting matters.

Throughout the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, our management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, executed the previously disclosed remediation plan which included the following measures:

•
performed a detailed risk assessment;

•
hired additional internal and external accounting resources, including third-party internal control advisors and technical accounting advisors;

•
redesigned and documented critical processes and controls associated with internal control over financial reporting;

•
designed and maintained formal accounting policies, procedures and controls over the fair presentation of our financial statements;

•
implemented a new enterprise resource planning system;

•
established proper segregation of duties and management review and approvals across all key business processes, applications and controls over information technology; 

•
designed, implemented and maintained controls over the preparation and review of journal entries and financial statements;

100

•
designed, implemented and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and information technology; and

•
implemented management audit tooling to monitor control performance.

Management implemented the majority of the remediation plan in the year ended December 31, 2023 and further tested, strengthened and improved the Internal Control Framework in the year ended December 31, 2024, including performing operating effectiveness testing.

Our management completed operating effectiveness testing over the implemented remediation procedures and controls during the year ended December 31, 2024, and found them to be operating effectively. As a result, management has concluded that the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting have been remediated as of December 31, 2024.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Deloitte Accountants B.V., our independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte Accountants B.V. is contained in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Other than the remediation activities described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a‑15(d) and 15d‑15(d) of the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

102

We believe Dr. Kastelein’s deep scientific and medical knowledge about NewAmsterdam Pharma’s product candidate and his experience in senior management, provide Dr. Kastelein with the qualifications and skills to serve on the Board of Directors.

The code of business conduct and ethics includes a provision that provides for a process by which employees and directors can report potential irregularities. The code of business conduct and ethics also provides protection from retaliation or discrimination by the Company against whistleblowers due to reporting issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

If the nomination and corporate governance committee approves a candidate for further review they will establish an interview process for the candidate. The nomination and corporate governance committee will also take into consideration the candidate’s personal attributes, including, without limitation, personal integrity, loyalty, ability to apply sound and independent business judgment, awareness of a director’s vital part in our good corporate citizenship and image, time available for meetings and consultation on our matters and willingness to assume broad, fiduciary responsibility.

Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

We maintain a shareholder-approved, formal, written compensation policy consistent with Dutch law. The compensation policy provides that the amount, level and structure of compensation should contribute to the Company's strategy, long-term interests and sustainability by:

•
attracting, retaining and motivating highly skilled individuals with the qualities, capabilities, profile and experience needed to support and promote the growth and sustainable success of the Company and its business;

•
driving strong business performance, promoting accountability and incentivizing the achievement of short and long-term performance targets with the objective of furthering long-term value creation in a manner consistent with the Company's identity, mission and values;

•
assuring that the interests of the Company's directors are closely aligned to those of the Company, its business and its stakeholders; and

•
ensuring overall market competitiveness of the compensation packages, while providing the Board of Directors sufficient flexibility to tailor the Company's compensation practices on a case-by-case basis, depending on the market conditions from time to time.

To achieve these objectives, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) regularly evaluates our executive compensation program to determine components of compensation and establish compensation levels that are appropriate based on each executive’s level of experience, performance, growth potential, job responsibility and criticality of role, and that align with the Company's size and stage.

Executive Compensation Components

Our executive compensation program generally consists of, and is intended to strike a balance among, the following three principal components: base salary, annual performance-based cash bonuses and long-term incentive equity grants. We also provide our executive officers with severance and change-in-control benefits, as well as other benefits available to all our employees, including retirement benefits under the Company’s U.S. 401(k) plan, retirement arrangements for employees in other countries and participation in employee benefit plans. The following chart summarizes the key features and objectives of the three main elements of compensation.

Element

Description

Objectives

Base Salary

•
Fixed cash compensation. 
•
Determined based on each executive officer’s role, individual skills, experience, performance, and external market value.

•
Provide stable compensation to executive officers, allow the Company to attract and retain skilled executive talent and maintain a stable leadership team.

Short-Term Incentives: Annual Bonus Plan

•
Variable cash compensation based on the level of achievement of pre-determined annual corporate goals and personal performance.

•
Promote and reward the achievement of key annual strategic, business and operational goals.

107

Long-Term Incentives: Equity-Based Compensation

•
Variable equity-based compensation.
•
Share options: Right to purchase shares at a price equal to the share price on the grant date.

•
Motivate and reward achievement of multi-year strategic goals and delivery of sustained long-term value to shareholders, as well as attract and retain executive officers.

Compensation Program Governance

The Compensation Committee assesses the effectiveness of our executive compensation program from time to time and reviews risk mitigation and governance matters, which includes maintaining the following best practices:

What We Do

​☑

Pay for Performance

The majority of total executive compensation is variable and at-risk.

☑

Balance Short- and Long-Term Compensation

The allocation of incentives among annual cash incentives and long-term equity incentives does not over-emphasize short-term performance at the expense of achieving long-term goals.

☑

Combination of Balanced Performance Metrics

We use a diverse set of milestone performance metrics in our annual performance bonus plan to ensure that no single measure affects compensation disproportionately.

☑

Independent Compensation Consultant

The Compensation Committee has engaged an independent compensation consultant to provide information and advice for use in Compensation Committee decision-making.

☑

Peer Data

We develop a peer group of companies based on industry, development stage, therapeutic focus, research and development expense, market capitalization, employee headcount, and number of years as a public company to reference for compensation decisions.

☑

Clawback

We maintain a clawback policy compliant with SEC and Nasdaq rules.

☑

Double Trigger Change-in-Control Provisions

We entered into agreements with each of the NEOs that provide certain financial benefits if there is both a change in control and a termination of employment (a “double trigger”). A change in control alone would not trigger cash severance pay.

What We Don’t Do

✘

No Hedging or Pledging of Company Securities

We prohibit officers and non-employee directors from engaging in hedging, pledging or short sale transactions in Company securities.

✘

No Perks

We do not provide material perquisites to executive officers.

✘

No Excise Tax Gross-Ups

We do not provide excise tax gross-ups.

✘

No Share Options Below Fair Market Value

We do not grant share options with an exercise price below fair market value.

✘

No Guaranteed Compensation

We do not have agreements with our NEOs that provide any guarantees relating to base salary increases or the amounts of any annual cash incentive awards or long-term equity awards.

108

✘

No Special Retirement Benefits

We do not provide defined benefit pension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our executive officers or employees. Our NEOs and other executives are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan (U.S.) or personal pension plan on the same basis as our other employees.

✘

No Share Option Repricing

We do not permit repricing of share options or share appreciation rights without shareholder approval.

Compensation Determination Process

Role of our Shareholders

Our shareholders have adopted a formal, written compensation policy in accordance with Dutch law. Changes to the compensation policy will require a vote of the General Meeting by simple majority of votes cast. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee determine the compensation of individual directors and executive officers with due observance of the compensation policy to the extent applicable.

We did not consider the results of any shareholder advisory vote on the 2024 compensation of our NEOs, as no such vote was required due to our status as an “emerging growth company” as of December 31, 2024.

Role of the Compensation Committee

The Compensation Committee establishes the compensation philosophy and objectives (in accordance with the compensation policy), determines the structure, components and other elements of executive compensation, and reviews and approves the compensation of the NEOs or recommends it for approval by the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee structures the executive compensation program to accomplish its articulated compensation objectives in light of the compensation philosophy described above.

The Compensation Committee annually reviews compensation policies and procedures to determine if any updates are needed. The Compensation Committee also approves, or recommends to the Board of Directors for approval, the corporate objectives associated with our annual performance-based cash incentive program, as well as assessing the Company’s performance against those corporate objectives after the end of the year or making a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to the extent to which the Company has met those corporate objectives.

The Compensation Committee meets periodically throughout the year to manage and evaluate our executive compensation program, and generally determines executive compensation on an annual basis, typically at the beginning of each fiscal year; however, decisions may occur during the year for new hires, promotions or other special circumstances as the Compensation Committee determines appropriate.

Role of the CEO and Management

The Compensation Committee generally seeks the input of our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") when discussing the performance of, and compensation for, our executive officers, including the NEOs other than the CEO. Our CEO is instrumental in developing both our annual and long-term strategic objectives and goals, which are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors. Our CEO is also instrumental in providing perspective on our performance against those goals.

Our CEO reviews the performance of the other executive officers, including the other NEOs, annually and presents his conclusions to the Compensation Committee. Our CEO then provides corresponding compensation recommendations, including as to base salary adjustments, annual performance-based cash compensation targets and payouts, and equity awards. The Compensation Committee considers the CEO’s input as one factor in its deliberations to determine the compensation of our executive officers, including the other NEOs. The Compensation Committee gives significant weight to the recommendations of the CEO in light of his greater familiarity with the day-to-day performance of his direct reports and the importance of incentive compensation in driving the execution of managerial initiatives developed and led by the CEO.

While the CEO may attend Compensation Committee meetings, the CEO may not be present during voting or deliberations on his compensation and does not play a role in determining his compensation.

In addition, other members of management may attend Compensation Committee meetings to provide background information or advice, or to answer questions posed by members of the Compensation Committee, including with respect to the financial, accounting, tax and retention implications of various compensation decisions.

109

Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant

The Compensation Committee recognizes that there is value in procuring independent, objective expertise in connection with fulfilling its duties, and pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to select and retain advisors to assist it with carrying out its duties and responsibilities.

The Compensation Committee has engaged the services of an independent compensation consultant, the Human Capital Solutions practice of Aon plc (“Aon”), to assist it in connection with making executive compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee has worked with Aon to develop a peer group, to provide a competitive market analysis of the base salary, annual performance-based cash incentive awards and long-term incentive compensation of our executive officers compared against the peer group, and to review other market practices and trends with respect to executive compensation.

The Compensation Committee annually assesses the independence of Aon pursuant to SEC and Nasdaq rules. In 2024, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Aon consistent with Nasdaq listing standards and concluded that the engagement of Aon does not raise any conflict of interest.

While the Compensation Committee took into consideration the review and recommendations of Aon when making decisions about our executive compensation program, ultimately, the Compensation Committee made its own independent decisions in determining our executives’ compensation.

Consideration of Comparative Market Data

The Compensation Committee believes that obtaining relevant market and benchmark data is important to making determinations about executive compensation. This information provides a solid reference point and helpful context for making compensation decisions, even though, relative to other companies, there are differences and unique aspects of the Company.

With Aon’s assistance and input, the Compensation Committee annually adopts a peer group of companies that it uses as a reference group to provide a broad perspective on competitive pay levels and practices.

In doing so, the Compensation Committee seeks to approve a peer group that is representative of the sector in which we operate and includes companies within an appropriate defined range in terms of key attributes.

In October 2023, the Compensation Committee determined that our peer group for determining the compensation of our NEOs in 2024 would consist of Phase 2 and Phase 3 biopharmaceutical/biotechnology companies. In general, the selection criteria consisted of the following:

•
market capitalizations between one-third and three times the market capitalization of the Company;

•
annual revenues less than $100 million;

•
fewer than 150 employees; and

•
preference given to companies that went public within the last five years.

Based on these criteria, the peer group for setting 2024 compensation consisted of the following 24 companies:

4D Molecular Therapeutics, Inc.

Humacyte, Inc.

PMV Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

89bio, Inc.

IDEAYA Biosciences, Inc.

Replimune Group, Inc.

Akero Therapeutics, Inc.

Immunovant, Inc.

Scholar Rock Holding Corporation

Belite Bio, Inc.

Inhibrx, Inc.

Structure Therapeutics Inc.

Cogent Biosciences, Inc.

Keros Therapeutics, Inc.

Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Krystal Biotech, Inc.

Ventyx Biosciences, Inc.

Cullinan Oncology, Inc.

Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Vera Therapeutics, Inc.

Erasca, Inc.

Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.

Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

The Compensation Committee utilizes the compensation of executive officers of the companies in this peer group as one reference point in the compensation-setting process along with various other factors, such as the executive’s performance, experience, and competitive market conditions.

Additionally, when considering the establishment of 2024 compensation levels for our NEOs, the Compensation Committee, upon recommendation from Aon, supplemented the 2024 peer group long-term incentive market data with data derived from the Radford 2023 Global Life Science Survey for public pre-commercial biopharma companies with under 150 employees. This survey data was used to obtain a general understanding of the compensation practices of companies similar to ours at the time.

The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation practices of our peer group, together with the data derived from the Radford 2023 Global Life Science Survey, provided us with appropriate compensation reference points for evaluating and determining the compensation of our NEOs during 2024.

2024 Executive Compensation Program

Our executive compensation program generally consists of, and is intended to strike a balance among, the following three principal components: base salary, annual performance-based cash bonus, and long-term incentive equity compensation.

CEO and NEO Pay Mix

Though the Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal or informal policies or guidelines that specify the allocation of compensation between these three elements, consistent with our “pay-for-performance” philosophy, the Compensation Committee has determined that NEO compensation packages must include an emphasis on and substantial portion of variable, at-risk pay while ensuring adequate base salary to attract and retain talent. The Compensation Committee considers compensation to be at-risk if it is subject to performance-based payment or vesting conditions or if its value depends on share price appreciation.

Our executive compensation is linked strongly to the performance of the business, with a majority of annual target compensation being variable and at-risk. In 2024, 90% of the total target compensation for the CEO was at-risk and 77% of the total target compensation for all other NEOs was at-risk. The following pay mix pie chart graphics illustrate our emphasis on variable, at-risk pay and long-term incentives.

The percentages of target total direct compensation as calculated above are based on the annualized 2024 base salary, the 2024 annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (assuming achievement at the target level), and the grant date fair value of the annual option grants to NEOs. Each compensation element is described in this section and outlined in more detail in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.

Base Salary

We provide our executive officers with fixed cash compensation in the form of a base salary. In establishing base salaries, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion and considers several factors, including the performance of the individual executive officer, the officer’s potential to contribute to our long-term strategic goals, the officer’s role and scope of responsibilities within our Company, individual experience and skills, the officer’s compensation as compared to similarly situated executives at comparable companies in our peer group, competitive market dynamics for the position, and (with respect to other NEOs) the input of our CEO. None of our NEOs is currently party to an employment agreement or other agreement or arrangement that provides for automatic or scheduled increases in base salary.

Annual base salaries for our NEOs for the positions they held as of December 31, 2024, as compared with their annual base salaries as of December 31, 2023, were as follows:

Annual Performance-Based Cash Bonus

The annual cash incentive bonus plan (the “Annual Bonus Plan”) is a cash-based plan that rewards executive officers for the achievement of key short-term objectives. The structure of the Annual Bonus Plan incentivizes executive officers to achieve research, clinical, operational, and organizational results that the Compensation Committee views as critical to the execution of our business strategy.

For the NEOs, the amount of the payout, if any, under the Annual Bonus Plan is based on operational performance as well as individual performance. The Annual Bonus Plan gives considerable weight to achievement of key corporate and individual goals, while providing the Compensation Committee with the ability to exercise its best judgment in determining the overall level of achievement of such goals.

Target Opportunities.
 The Compensation Committee determines the target cash incentive opportunity available to each NEO by taking the individual’s annual base salary in effect for the year and multiplying it by the individual’s target incentive percentage. Among other factors, the target incentive percentages are determined with reference to the peer group company percentages of salary for the respective positions and the proportion of total direct compensation represented by the annual cash incentive. For 2024, our NEOs had the following annual cash bonus targets:

Corporate Performance Goals.
 As a pre-commercial biopharmaceutical company, we do not have material revenue or profits at this stage, and our success is measured by achievement of research and development milestones and other key strategic and operational goals.

In evaluating corporate performance, the Compensation Committee considered our achievement against the 2024 corporate goals as follows:

•
Clinical development goals to progress our product candidate (relative weighting 40%, or plus 75% upon achievement of stretch goals);

•
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls goals relating to on-time supply for clinical trials and launch readiness (5%);

•
Finance goals of assuring adequate funding for current activities and a reasonable runway (20%);

•
Intellectual Property, Operations and Business Development goals related to patents, trademarks and regulatory requirements, hiring for new key positions, and initiating various business development activities (15%, or plus 25% upon achievement of stretch goals); and

•
Commercial / Medical Affairs goals, including the development and execution of launch plan in multiple markets (20%).

Corporate Performance Goals and Related Payouts. 
If we do not achieve an objective of corporate performance, there is no corresponding amount to be included in the payout related to that element. If we achieve the objective, the Compensation Committee will authorize a payout of the portion of the overall opportunity allocated to that element; if we exceed the objective by achieving a stretch goal, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, authorize a higher payout, but the total payout will not exceed 200% of an executive’s overall target incentive.

2024 Achievement of Corporate Goals. 
In January 2025, the Compensation Committee met to consider how the Company had performed against corporate performance goals. While the Compensation Committee considered management’s views regarding their 2024 achievements, the Compensation Committee made an independent determination regarding corporate performance, which included consideration of the following:

Clinical Research

In 2024, we announced updated clinical results for the following:

112

•
In April, we announced that we met the enrollment target for PREVAIL, the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating obicetrapib in adult patients with a history of ASCVD, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled, despite being on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. Driven by strong patient and physician interest globally, we extended enrollment to the end of April and randomized over 9,500 patients.

•
In May, we announced the initiation of REMBRANDT, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating obicetrapib and ezetimibe against placebo on coronary atherosclerotic plaque characteristics in adults with or at high-risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

•
In July, we announced positive statistically significant results from BROOKLYN, the first of two pivotal Phase 3 trials of obicetrapib. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of 10 mg obicetrapib compared to placebo and showed that obicetrapib has a substantial and rapid effect on LDL levels. Obicetrapib was also observed to be well tolerated, with safety results comparable to placebo and no increase in blood pressure.

•
In November, we announced positive topline results from TANDEM, the Phase 3 trial evaluating obicetrapib and ezetimibe fixed-dose combination. These results will support our global regulatory filings for the 10 mg obicetrapib and 10 mg ezetimibe fixed-dose combination in adult patients with HeFH and/or ASCVD or multiple ASCVD risk factors, which will potentially offer a simple, once-daily treatment capable of significantly reducing LDL-C and improve cardiovascular outcomes.

•
In December, we announced positive topline data from a pivotal Phase 3 BROADWAY clinical trial evaluating obicetrapib in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Corporate

•
In February, we completed an upsized public offering of 5,871,909 ordinary shares and 4,736,841 pre-funded warrants, generating net proceeds of $190.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The offering attracted several new and existing investors.

•
In April, we appointed Juliette Audet as Chief Business Officer.

•
In June, we announced the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 12,006,305, titled “Salts of Obicetrapib and Processes for their Manufacture and Intermediates Thereof.” The patent contains claims covering amorphous obicetrapib hemicalcium, the solid form that will be used in the Company’s products and will be listed in the FDA’s “Orange Book” as a drug substance patent, if approved. The issuance of this composition of matter patent provides intellectual property protection for obicetrapib until July 2043.

•
In December, we completed an upsized public offering of 14,667,347 ordinary shares and 4,882,653 pre-funded warrants, generating net proceeds of $453.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The offering attracted several new and existing investors.

Individual Performance. 
In determining Annual Bonus Plan payouts, the Compensation Committee also evaluated the individual performance of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee views the inclusion of individual performance as an important component of the annual cash bonus plan because it motivates the NEOs for individual performance, even if overall corporate performance is lower. In assessing the individual performance of our NEOs, the Compensation Committee, with the input of our CEO for the non-CEO NEOs, considered each such officer’s individual contributions to the achievement of our 2024 goals, and the officer’s individual performance in helping to execute on our strategic and operating initiatives.

Overall Payouts. 
Based on the assessment described above, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors determined, that the Company’s corporate performance exceeded the 2024 goals. The Compensation Committee determined an overall 2024 performance level, as determined with reference to both corporate performance and individual performance. The amounts of the annual bonus awards for 2024 were determined as follows:

Equity-Based Incentive Awards

The third and largest component of the executive compensation program is long-term equity incentives. The Compensation Committee designed the long-term incentive opportunity for the NEOs to motivate and reward executive officers to achieve multiyear strategic goals and deliver sustained long-term value to shareholders.

We believe that equity awards provide our executives with a strong link to our long-term performance, create an ownership culture and help to align the interests of our executives and our shareholders. Long-term equity incentives also promote retention because executive officers will only receive value if they remain employed by us over the required term.

Grants to our NEOs and other employees are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and are generally made upon commencement of employment, promotion or annually during the first quarter of each year. We believe that our equity awards are an important retention tool for our executive officers, as well as for our other employees.

We have used stock option grants as our primary equity vehicle because we believe that they are an effective means by which to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. Among companies that are similar to ours in terms of stage of development, options are very common as the form of equity awards. Share options can motivate stock price appreciation over the long term because they deliver value only if the stock price increases. The use of share options also can provide tax and other advantages to our executive officers relative to other forms of equity compensation.

In determining the number of options to be granted to an NEO, the Compensation Committee takes into account equally both the range of long-term incentive award values granted to executive officers at the companies in the peer group and the range of grant size as a percent of the companies in the peer group.

The annual option incentive awards granted to our NEOs are set forth in the table below:

The amounts reflect the grand date fair value of the options granted.

The exercise price of all share option awards to NEOs is equal to the closing price of our shares on the date of the grant, and all share options granted in 2024 have a ten-year term. The options are subject to time-based vesting, with 25% of the total number of shares underlying the award vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal monthly installments for 36 months, subject to the applicable NEO's continued service through each such vesting date.

Additional Elements of Compensation

Employee Benefits

Our NEOs are eligible to participate in all our employee benefit plans, such as medical, dental, vision, group life, short and long-term disability and our 401(k) plan for U.S. employees, in each case on the same basis as other employees, subject to applicable laws. Under our 401(k) plan, the Company currently makes matching contributions of 100% of the first 3% and then 50% of the next 2% of employee contributions. We believe these benefits are important to attracting and retaining experienced employees, including our executives.

Ms. Audet resides in Switzerland and is employed by the Company in Switzerland. In 2024, the Company made contributions to Ms. Audet’s statutory Swiss pension plan account in accordance with Swiss law.

Perquisites

We do not provide material perquisites to our executive officers.

Severance and Change in Control Arrangements

We have entered into employment agreements with all our NEOs that provide for at-will employment without any specific term. Each of the agreements sets forth the NEO’s severance benefits payable upon a qualifying termination of employment or change in control of the Company. The “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” section below describes and quantifies the severance and other benefits potentially payable to the NEOs in further detail.

These agreements provide for a combination of a cash severance payment, continued health benefits and acceleration of vesting on outstanding equity awards in specified circumstances. Acceleration of vesting is subject to a “double trigger” arrangement, meaning that

114

vesting acceleration occurs only in the event of a change in control of the Company in connection with or followed by a termination of employment without cause by us, or with good reason by the NEO.

Given the industry in which we participate and the range of strategic initiatives that we may explore, we believe reasonable and competitive severance and change-in-control payment and benefit arrangements are an essential element of our executive compensation package and assist us in recruiting and retaining a talented executive team. We also believe such payments and benefits are in the best interests of our shareholders because they incentivize senior executives to continue to strive to achieve shareholder value in connection with change-in-control situations, particularly where the possibility of a change-in-control and the related uncertainty may lead to the departure or distraction of senior executives to the detriment of our Company and our shareholders.

We do not provide any excise tax gross ups in connection with severance paid upon termination without cause or relating to a change-in-control transaction. All change-in-control cash payments are structured to be on a “double-trigger” basis, requiring a termination without cause by us, or with good reason by the NEO, in connection with the change-in-control transaction.

Additional Compensation Policies and Practices

Clawback Policy

In 2023, the Compensation Committee of our Board adopted our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (the “Clawback Policy”), designed to comply with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608, which provides for recoupment of incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the relevant securities laws. The policy applies to our current and former executive officers. Compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure (as defined in the Clawback Policy) that is determined to have been paid erroneously given the restatement is subject to recoupment.

Equity Granting Practices

The Compensation Committee does not grant stock options or similar equity awards during periods in which there is material nonpublic information about our Company, including (1) outside a “trading window” established in connection with the public release of quarterly results information or (2) at any time during the four business days prior to or the one business day following the filing of our periodic reports or the filing or furnishing of a Form 8-K that discloses material nonpublic information. The Compensation Committee does not take material nonpublic information into account when determining the timing and terms of equity awards. Stock options may occasionally be awarded on an off-cycle basis, including to new hires. The Company has not timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information to affect the value of executive compensation.

Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies

We have a policy that prohibits our executive officers, directors and other employees from engaging in short sales, transactions in put or call options, or other inherently speculative transactions with respect to our shares. In addition, our insider trading policy prohibits pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan or ownership of Company securities in a margin account. Any violation of these policies may result in disciplinary action, including dismissal for cause.

Tax Considerations; Section 162(m)

When reviewing compensation matters, the Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax consequences to us (and, when relevant, to our executive officers) of the various payments under our compensation programs. Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction for any publicly held corporation for individual compensation of more than $1.0 million to certain executive officers in any taxable year. The Compensation Committee may provide compensation to executive officers that may not be tax deductible if it believes that providing that compensation is in the best interests of our Company and its shareholders.

Accounting Policies for Stock-Priced Compensation

We follow the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (“ASC 718”) for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC 718 requires companies to calculate the grant date “fair value” of their stock-based awards using a variety of assumptions. ASC 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based awards in their income statements over the period that an employee is required to render service in exchange for the award. Grants of share options under our equity incentive award plans are accounted for under ASC 718. Our Board or Compensation Committee will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs.

Equity Incentive Plans

LTIP

We have established our LTIP, under which we may grant options, restricted shares, restricted share units, share appreciation rights and other equity and equity-based awards. As of December 31, 2024, the total number of Ordinary Shares underlying awards granted under the LTIP (other than awards granted as Earnout RSUs in accordance with the Business Combination Agreements or as replacement awards in connection with a merger or business combination) will not exceed 17,772,578; provided that the number of Ordinary Shares reserved for grant under the LTIP will increase annually on January 1 of each calendar year by 5% of the-then issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares or such lower number as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

The LTIP is administered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has delegated authority to grant awards under the LTIP to the Compensation Committee for awards to eligible participants not then serving on the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has also delegated the authority to grant awards under the LTIP to non-executive officers to Dr. Davidson who will determine when to grant equity awards and the terms of such awards. We may grant awards under the LTIP to our directors, employees, consultants or other advisors. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may condition awards under the LTIP upon the achievement or satisfaction of performance criteria and/or continued service with the Company and determines the vesting conditions for awards under the LTIP. The LTIP includes provisions for good leavers and bad leavers as well as for change-in-control.

Rollover Option Plan

We also established a rollover option plan (the “Rollover Plan”) in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, under which we assumed the outstanding options of certain optionholders of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. who held their options through entities

120

in exchange for a grant of options to acquire Ordinary Shares. The total number of Ordinary Shares underlying the options covered by the Rollover Plan is 1,736,545. Any Ordinary Shares underlying options granted under the Rollover Plan that are forfeited, canceled or otherwise terminated will become available for issuance under the LTIP.

The Rollover Plan is administered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee. The Rollover Plan includes provisions applicable in the event of a change-in-control.

Supplementary LTIP

We have also established our supplementary long-term incentive plan (the “Supplementary LTIP”), under which we may grant options, restricted shares, restricted share units, share appreciation rights and other equity and equity-based awards to our employees and consultants (but not our directors). The total number of Ordinary Shares underlying awards that may be granted under the Supplementary LTIP (other than awards granted as replacement awards in connection with a merger or business combination) will not exceed 1,040,233.

The Supplementary LTIP is administered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has delegated authority to grant awards under the Supplementary LTIP to the Compensation Committee for awards to anyone not then serving on the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has also delegated the authority to grant awards under the Supplementary LTIP to non-executive officers to Dr. Davidson, who will determine when to grant equity awards and the terms of such awards. The awards issued under the Supplementary LTIP will have terms substantially similar to those issued under the LTIP. The Supplementary LTIP includes provisions applicable in the event of a change-in-control.

Inducement Plan

We have also established our inducement plan (the “Inducement Plan”), under which we may grant options, restricted shares, restricted share units, share appreciation rights and other equity-based awards to our newly-hired (or newly-hired, after a bona fide period of non-employment) employees (but not directors). The total number of Ordinary Shares underlying awards that may be granted under the Inducement Plan will not exceed 1,500,000.

The Inducement Plan is administered exclusively by the Compensation Committee. The Inducement Plan includes provisions applicable in the event of a change-in-control.

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification

Under Dutch law, our directors may be held liable for damages in the event of improper or negligent performance of their duties. They may be held liable for damages to the Company and to third parties for infringement of the Articles of Association or of certain provisions of Dutch law. In certain circumstances, they may also incur other specific civil, administrative and criminal liabilities. Subject to certain exceptions, the Articles of Association provide for indemnification of our current and former directors and other current and former officers and employees as designated by the Board of Directors. No indemnification under the Articles of Association will be given to an indemnified person:

•
if a competent court or arbitral tribunal has established, without having (or no longer having) the possibility for appeal, that the acts or omissions of such indemnified person that led to the financial losses, damages, expenses, suit, claim, action or legal proceedings as described above are of an unlawful nature (including acts or omissions which are considered to constitute malice, gross negligence, intentional recklessness and/or serious culpability attributable to such indemnified person);

•
to the extent that his or her financial losses, damages and expenses are covered under insurance and the relevant insurer has settled, or has provided reimbursement for, these financial losses, damages and expenses (or has irrevocably undertaken to do so);

•
in relation to proceedings brought by such indemnified person against us, except for proceedings brought to enforce indemnification to which he or she is entitled pursuant to the Articles of Association, pursuant to an agreement between such indemnified person and us, which has been approved by us or pursuant to insurance taken out by us for the benefit of such indemnified person; and

•
for any financial losses, damages or expenses incurred in connection with a settlement of any proceedings effected without our prior consent.

Under the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may stipulate additional terms, conditions and restrictions in relation to the indemnification described above.

We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers providing for procedures for indemnification and advancements by us of certain expenses and costs relating to claims, suits or proceedings arising from his or her service to us or, at our request, service to other entities, as officers or directors to the maximum extent permitted by Dutch law and subject to the exceptions provided in such agreements.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

121

The Compensation Committee consists of Louis Lange, M.D., Ph.D., William H. Lewis and Mark C. McKenna. All members of the compensation committee are independent directors, and none of our executive officers or former executive officers served on the compensation committee or on the board of any company that employed any member of the compensation committee or the Board of Directors during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Director Compensation

Director Compensation

The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee determine the compensation of individual directors in accordance with our compensation policy to the extent applicable. All non-employee directors are paid an annual retainer of $43,000. Non-employee directors may receive further compensation ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 for serving as chair or member of committees (i.e., Audit Committee or Compensation Committee). We have also granted and expect to continue granting certain non-employee directors, other than those affiliated with our significant shareholders, options to purchase Ordinary Shares as compensation for their service on the Board of Directors.

Director Service Agreement

We entered into services agreements with all of our directors which regulate their services as our directors. These services agreements, except for James N. Topper’s services agreement, contain non-competition and non-solicitation arrangements, as well as a requirement to assign and transfer to us any intellectual and industrial property rights originating from the director’s services as a director or inventor for us, but do not provide for compensation.

Director Indemnification Agreements

The Articles of Association require us to indemnify our current and former directors to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to certain exceptions. We entered into indemnification agreements with all of our directors providing for procedures for indemnification and advancements by us of certain expenses and costs relating to claims, suits or proceedings arising from their service to us or, at our request, service to other entities, as directors or officers to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Director Compensation Table

The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation earned for service on the Board of Directors by our non-employee directors during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

The following table sets forth information regarding the actual beneficial ownership of Ordinary Shares as of February 18, 2025, by:

•
each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by the Company to beneficially own more than 5% of outstanding Ordinary Shares;

•
each of our executive officers or directors; and

•
all of our executive officers and directors, as a group.

The SEC has defined “beneficial ownership” of a security to mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power and/or investment power over such security. A shareholder is also deemed to be, as of any date, the beneficial owner of all securities that such shareholder has the right to acquire within 60 days after that date through (i) the exercise of any option, warrant or right, (ii) the conversion of a security, (iii) the power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement, or (iv) the automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, Ordinary Shares subject to options or other rights (as set forth above) held by that person that are currently exercisable, or will become exercisable within 60 days thereafter, are deemed outstanding, while such shares are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other person. Each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the Ordinary Shares shown as beneficially owned by such person, except as otherwise indicated in the table or footnotes below.

123

The beneficial ownership of Ordinary Shares is based on 109,817,812 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding, as of February 18, 2025. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by them. To our knowledge, no Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by any executive officer, director or director nominee have been pledged as security. None of our shareholders has different voting rights from other shareholders.

Item 13. Certain Relationships
 and Related Transactions, and Director Independence

Independence of the Board of Directors

The nomination and corporate governance committee and Board of Directors have undertaken a review of the independence of our directors and considered whether any director has a relationship that, in the opinion of such committee or the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a member of the Board of Directors. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning such director’s background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, the Board of Directors has determined that all of our directors, other than Dr. Davidson and Dr. Kastelein, are “independent directors,” as such term is defined in Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2). In making these determinations, the Board of Directors considered the current and prior relationships that each director has with the Company and all other facts and circumstances that the Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each director.

126

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons

We adopted a related party transaction policy that requires the review and, if applicable, approval or ratification of any related party transaction by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee or another designated committee consisting solely of independent directors. Our Audit Committee will review this related party transaction policy periodically and will recommend changes to the Board of Directors as appropriate.

In addition, under Dutch law and the Articles of Association, our directors may not take part in any discussion or decision-making that involves a subject or transaction in relation to which he or she has a direct or indirect personal conflict of interest with us. Such a conflict of interest would generally arise if the director concerned is unable to serve our interests and the business connected with us with the required level of integrity and objectivity due to the existence of the conflicting personal interest. The Articles of Association provide that if as a result of conflicts of interests no resolution of the Board of Directors can be adopted, the resolution may nonetheless be adopted by the Board of Directors as if none of our directors had a conflict of interest. In that latter case, each of our director is entitled to participate in the discussion and decision-making process and to cast a vote.

A related party transaction is generally any transaction in which the Company or its subsidiaries is or will be a participant, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a director (or nominee), executive officer, immediate family member, or any beneficial owner of more than 5% of our Ordinary Shares, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

Certain Related Party Transactions

Investor Rights Agreement

In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we entered into the Investor Rights Agreement, dated November 22, 2022 (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), with the Sponsor and the former FLAC directors (the “FLAC Initial Shareholders”), and certain NewAmsterdam Pharma shareholders agreed not to sell, assign, offer to sell, contract, pledge, grant, or otherwise dispose of or enter into any swap or other similar arrangement, with respect to the Ordinary Shares such persons received in connection with the Business Combination for six months from the date the Domestication became effective (the “Final Closing Date”), subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, the FLAC Initial Shareholders agreed not to sell, assign, offer to sell, contract, pledge, grant, or otherwise dispose of or enter into any swap or other similar arrangement, with respect to the Ordinary Shares they received in connection with the Business Combination for a period beginning on the Final Closing Date and ending one year after the Final Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions above ended with respect to the Ordinary Shares held by the NewAmsterdam Pharma shareholders and 50% of the Ordinary Shares held by the FLAC Initial Shareholders, as the case may be, received in connection with the Business Combination, on May 22, 2023 according to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement. The restrictions on the remaining 50% of the Ordinary Shares of the FLAC Initial Shareholders received in connection with the Business Combination ended on November 23, 2023, one year after the Final Closing Date. An aggregate of 44,914,642 Ordinary Shares held by former NewAmsterdam Pharma shareholders (including Amgen and MTPC) had registration rights pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement.

In June 2023, certain of our selling securityholders (the “Selling Securityholders”) exercised their right pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement to demand an underwritten shelf takedown of Ordinary Shares. On June 6, 2023, the Company and certain of the Selling Securityholders, including affiliates of Forbion, entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC and SVB Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”). The Underwriting Agreement related to an underwritten public offering of 13,857,415 Ordinary Shares by those certain Selling Securityholders at a public offering price of $11.50 per Ordinary Share (the “Secondary Offering”). In connection with the Secondary Offering, certain of the participating Selling Securityholders granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 2,078,612 Ordinary Shares at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, which option was partially exercised for 1,930,280 additional Ordinary Shares in connection with the closing of the Secondary Offering. The Company did not sell any Ordinary Shares in the Secondary Offering and did not receive any proceeds from the Secondary Offering.

Indemnification Agreements

The Articles of Association provide for certain indemnification rights for our current and former directors and other current and former officers and employees as designated by the Board of Directors (the “Indemnified Persons”). Specifically, we indemnify the Indemnified Persons against any financial losses or damages and any expense reasonably paid or incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed suit, to the extent these relate to such Indemnified Persons’ current or former position with the Company as permitted by applicable law.

We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers providing for procedures for indemnification and advancements by us of certain expenses and costs relating to claims, suits or proceedings arising from his or her service to us or, at our request, service to other entities, as officers or directors to the maximum extent permitted by Dutch law and subject to the exceptions provided in such agreements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
 REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), Mezzanine Equity and Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit) and Cash Flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Research and development accruals and prepayments – Refer to Notes 2, 7 and 8 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

As disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company records research and development accruals and prepayments for clinical trials based on estimates of the progress to completion of specific research and development tasks using data including information provided by vendors on their actual costs incurred. For certain vendors involved in clinical trials, the actual progress of the research and development activities may significantly differ from timing and value of invoices received and/or payments remitted under the terms of the agreements. Estimates of expenses incurred are further determined through discussions with both internal personnel and vendors as to the status of progress of completion of the specified research and development tasks. Expenses incurred in excess of amounts invoiced are recorded as accruals. Payments made in excess of expenses incurred are recorded as prepayments.

We identified the research and development accruals and prepayments of certain vendors in clinical trials as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment required by management in estimating the progress of the research and development activities conducted, as the progress is not directly observable. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing procedures to audit management's estimates of progress and evaluating the results of those procedures.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the research and development accruals and prepayments included the following, among others:

•
Evaluating the Company’s process, methodology, and significant assumptions made in estimating the value of expenses incurred for which the invoice has not been received and the payments made for which underlying procedures had not been carried out.

F-
2

•
Testing the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the measurement and recognition of the accruals and prepayments including sending direct confirmations with the vendors.

•
Inspecting selected research agreements, as well as amendments thereto, to evaluate whether the progress of the clinical trials reflects all relevant contractual elements.

•
Assessing publicly available information, such as press releases and investor presentations, and board’s meeting minutes regarding the status of clinical trial activities and comparing this information to the judgments applied in recording of the accruals and prepayments.

•
Performing retrospective analysis of accruals at the end of the prior period to current year activity for a selection of contracts to assess the accuracy of the Company’s estimation methodology.

•
Performing inquiries with Company personnel outside of the finance department who are responsible for overseeing the activities performed by the Company’s contracted third-party vendors, which include the vendor’s estimate of the progress of a selection of clinical trials.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.	The Company
NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V. (“NewAmsterdam Pharma” or the “Company”) is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to improve patient care in populations with metabolic diseases where currently approved therapies have not been adequate or well-tolerated. The Company was incorporated in the Netherlands as a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) under the name NewAmsterdam Pharma Company B.V. on June 10, 2022. On November 21, 2022, the Company’s corporate form was converted to a Dutch public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) and its name was changed to NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V. The Company’s ordinary shares, nominal value €
0.12
 per share (the "Ordinary Shares") are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and trade under the symbol “NAMS.”
In November 2022, the Company conducted an internal reorganization for the purpose of participating in the merger of the acquired company, Frazier Lifesciences Acquisition Corporation (“FLAC”) as described in Note 3. As a result of the internal restructuring and merger, NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V., FLAC and NewAmsterdam Pharma Investment Corporation, a new Cayman-based exempted company, became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of more advanced or effective therapies, dependence on key executives, protection of and dependence on intellectual property, compliance with government regulations and ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Significant additional research and development efforts and regulatory approval will be required prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.
Going Concern
The Company has incurred net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and had an accumulated deficit of $
558.6
 million as of 
December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $
771.7
 million. Management believes that the existing financial resources are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least the twelve-month period following the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any reference in these notes to the applicable guidance is meant to refer to authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Functional and Reporting Currency
The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries has been the United States Dollar (“USD” or “$”) since January 1, 2023. Prior to that the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries was the Euro (“EUR” or “€”). Significant elements involved in the determination of the functional currency change included a shift in the Company’s sources of financing from EUR to USD given its access to the U.S. public market and an increase of

F-
9

operating costs incurred in USD due to Phase 3 trials taking place predominantly in the United States, among other factors. Given these significant changes, management concluded that the majority of the factors supported the determination of the USD as the functional currency.
The reporting currency of the Company is USD.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has a controlling financial interest either through variable interest or through voting interest. Currently, the Company has no involvement with variable interest entities and all subsidiaries are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions, balances, income, and expenses are eliminated in consolidation. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognized in assets are also eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, assumptions related to the Company’s revenue recognition, accrual of research and development expenses, valuation of stock option awards and valuation of derivative instruments. The Company based its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates when there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. If actual results differ from the Company’s estimates, or to the extent these estimates are adjusted in future periods, the Company’s results of operations could either benefit from, or be adversely affected by, any such change in estimate.
Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are carried at fair value under U.S. GAAP either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting and reporting. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:
•
Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
For 
assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing

F-
10

categorization 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole), at the end of each reporting period.
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer. The Company has one business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results, and plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, the Company has 
one
 operating segment and, therefore, 
one
 reportable segment, which comprises the discovery, development and commercialization of transformative therapies for cardio-metabolic diseases.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash comprises checking and savings deposits. The carrying amount of these assets is approximately equal to their fair value due to their short-term nature. The Company maintains certain deposits which exceed the amounts covered by insurance provided by the government of the country in which the deposits are held. The Company has not experienced any losses related to amounts held in excess of such limits.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government and U.S. government agency obligations that are classified as available-for-sale. All marketable securities have a maturity of less than one year from the date of purchase. Further, since these securities are highly liquid and available to fund current operations, they are classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company adjusts the cost of available-for-sale debt securities for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The Company includes such amortization and accretion as a component of interest income, net based on the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses and declines in value, if any, that the Company judges to be the result of impairment or as a result of recognizing an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of interest income, net. To determine whether an impairment exists, the Company considers whether it intends to sell the debt security and, if the Company does not intend to sell the debt security, it considers available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. During the year ended December 31, 2024
 the Company determined it did 
no
t have any securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired. Prior to 2024 the Company held 
no
 marketable securities.
Marketable securities are stated at fair value, excluding accrued interest, with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company did 
no
t have any realized gains or losses on marketable securities.
Property Plant and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and is recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Upon disposal of an asset, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss on the transaction is recognized.
The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:

F-
11

Estimated Useful Life (in years)

Computer equipment

5

Office furniture and equipment

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest expense) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets, an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value is recorded. To date, the Company has not recorded any material impairment losses on long-lived assets.
Leases
In accordance with ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02” or “ASC 842”), the Company classifies leases at the lease commencement date. At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the circumstances present. Leases with a term greater than 
one year
 will be recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use assets (“ROU”), lease liabilities, and if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. The Company includes renewal options to extend the lease in the lease term where it is reasonably certain that it will exercise these options. Lease liabilities and the corresponding ROU are recorded based on the present values of lease payments over the terms. The Company determines the discount rate based on the implicit rate in the contract and if not readily determinable, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates that would be incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis, over similar terms, amounts equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Variable payments that do not depend on a rate or index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as incurred. Lease contracts do not include residual value guarantees nor do they include restrictions or other covenants. Certain adjustments to ROUs may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid, incentives received, or lease prepayments. If significant events, changes in circumstances, or other events indicate that the lease term or other inputs have changed, the Company would reassess lease classification, remeasure the lease liability using revised inputs as of the reassessment date, and adjust the ROU. Lease agreements with a noncancelable term of less than 12 months and no purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise are not recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Costs related to such lease agreements are operating cash flows and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Derivative Warrants Liability
The Company accounts for the public warrants and private placement warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
 ASC 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity
, under which the public warrants and private placement warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities carried at fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized as (expense)/income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The public warrants are valued based on the quoted market price as of each relevant reporting date, which is a Level 1 fair value measurement. The private warrants were initially and subsequently determined to have value equal to the public warrants as the terms of the instruments are substantially equivalent. The valuation of the private warrants is considered to be a Level 2 fair value measurement.
Derivative Earnout Liability
The Company accounts for the Earnout Shares (as defined below) allocated to Participating Shareholders (as defined below) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
 ASC 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity
, 
under which the Earnout Shares allocated to Participating Shareholders do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities carried at fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in

F-
12

fair 
value is recognized as (expense)/income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The liability is valued utilizing the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the probability of achieving the applicable milestone. The valuation of the Earnout Shares allocated to Participating Shareholders is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement.
Tranche Rights
On December 30, 2020, we entered into the Series A Subscription Agreement to issue Series A Preferred Shares for up to an aggregate amount of €
160
 million, occurring in two tranches. The first tranche closed in January 2021 (the “First Closing”). The Series A subscription agreement entitled us to cause the investors to subscribe for the second tranche Series A Preferred Shares upon the occurrence of certain clinical development and business development milestones.
As part of the Series A subscription agreement, investors were entitled to participate in the second tranche earlier, if they elect. This tranche right was determined to be a “freestanding financial instrument” as defined in the ASC Master Glossary because the tranche rights were transferable, and they did not need to be transferred with the related Series A shares. Further, upon the exercise of tranche rights, Series A shares held by investors remain outstanding. Management assessed the freestanding financial instrument under ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
, and determined that the tranche rights should be accounted for as a liability at fair value and revalued at each reporting period until settlement, with changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. This determination was made because the tranche rights were exercisable at the investor’s election, and therefore future issuance of Series A shares were a contingent event that was not in the Company’s control.
We issued the second tranche of Series A Preferred Shares in February 2022. This exercise of the tranche rights resulted in cash proceeds to the company, derecognition of the tranche right liability, and Series A Preferred Shares recognized at fair value, with the difference recorded to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Profit rights - Dezima acquisition
On April 9, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Saga Investments Coöperatief U.A., an affiliate of Amgen (“Amgen”) (the “2020 SPA”), to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of Dezima, a company whose principal activity was to develop compounds that treat cardiovascular disease related to dyslipidemia. The principal reason for this acquisition was to secure the intellectual property, licensing and know-how of the patented drug Obicetrapib and the in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). The Company paid consideration of €
1
 for the IPR&D asset and could potentially make an additional contingent payment depending on future qualifying exit events, if they occurred. In connection with the 2020 SPA, the Company and Amgen entered into a profit right and waiver agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (“MTPC”) (the “Profit Right Agreement”) in consideration for the waiver of certain rights held by MTPC prior to the Dezima transaction.
The Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. The acquisition of Dezima was accounted for as an asset acquisition because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the IPR&D of Obicetrapib. Additionally, the Company determined that as of the acquisition date, the IPR&D did not have an alternative future use by which the economic benefits could be anticipated and estimated. Therefore, it did not meet the definition of an asset and was expensed as incurred.
The aggregate contingent consideration to be paid to Amgen and MTPC would become payable upon a traditional underwritten public offering or an exit event, as defined in the 2020 SPA. These rights were recognized as a contingent consideration liability. Contingent consideration in an asset acquisition is measured and recognized when payment becomes probable and a reliable estimate can be made. Subsequent changes in the accrued amount of

F-
13

contingent consideration are measured and recognized at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement as an adjustment to the cost basis of the acquired asset or group of assets. However, as the acquired asset in the Dezima transaction was IPR&D with no alternative future use, any adjustment to the cost is expensed during the period and not capitalized.
The execution of the Menarini License (as defined in Note 4), in combination with the FLAC Merger (as defined in Note 3), qualified as an exit event pursuant to the 2020 SPA. As a result, on the Closing Date (as defined in Note 3), pursuant to the Profit Right Agreement, Amgen and MTPC each received their respective contingent payments in the form of Ordinary Shares. Immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the value of the financial liability was adjusted to equal the fair value of the Ordinary Shares to be issued to Amgen and MPTC at the closing of the Business Combination with the change in fair value recognized through earnings in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Finally, the liability was derecognized with the corresponding offset to equity to record the issuance of the Ordinary Shares to Amgen and MTPC.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASU 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and subsequent amendments (collectively, “ASC 606”).
Under ASC 606, to determine the recognition of revenue, the Company performs the following five steps:
1.
identify the contract(s) with the customer;
2.
identify the performance obligations in the in the contract;
3.
determine the transaction price;
4.
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5.
recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company performs an analysis to identify the performance obligations for its license agreement. Where a license agreement comprises several promises, it must be assessed whether these promises are capable of being distinct within the context of the contract. Promised goods or services are considered distinct when: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) the promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property, the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own and whether the required expertise is readily available. In addition, the Company considers whether the customer can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises.
The Company estimates the transaction price based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include both fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each arrangement that includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the amount of the potential payments and the likelihood that the payments will be received. The Company utilizes either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate variable consideration to include in the transaction price based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration expected to be received. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is highly probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.

F-
14

After the transaction price is determined, it is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on the estimated standalone selling price. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction, probabilities of technical and regulatory success and the estimated costs. Certain variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amounts the Company would expect to receive for each performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods and/or services as provided in the license agreement. The control can be transferred over time or at a point in time – which results in the recognition of revenue over time or at a point in time. The Company recognizes revenue over time as the customer simultaneously receive the benefits provided by the Company’s performance, satisfied over time.
Upfront licensing payments are recognized as revenue at the point in time when the Company transfers control of the license only if the license is determined to be a separate performance obligation from other undelivered performance obligations. Contingent development costs and milestone payments are generally included in the transaction price at the amount stipulated in the respective agreement and recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.
The Company will recognize royalty revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied)
Research and Development Expense
Research and development costs are recognized as an expense when incurred and are typically made up of clinical and preclinical activities, drug development and manufacturing costs, and include costs for clinical research organizations and investigative sites. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as information provided by vendors on their actual costs incurred. The determination of the level of services performed by the vendors and the associated expenditure incurred for the services provided is made at each balance sheet date.
Quantification of the research and development expenses incurred during the period requires judgment based on key estimates comprising of non-financial data, because the progress of activities is not directly observable and therefore the precise timing of the research and development activities may not be entirely certain. In estimating progress toward completion of specific tasks, the Company therefore uses non-financial data such as number of patient screenings, patient visits, patient enrollment, clinical site activations and vendor information of actual costs incurred. This data is obtained through reports from outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials or the completion of services and reviewed by Company personnel.
The costs of intangibles that are purchased from others for a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred or at the time when no alternative future use is identified.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Expenses are recognized on the accrual basis when incurred.
Personnel Expenses
Wages and salaries, social security contributions, payroll taxes, bonuses, and other employee benefits are recognized on the accrual basis in which the employee provides the associated services.

F-
15

The Company’s pension plans are classified as defined contribution plans, and, accordingly, no pension obligations are recognized in the balance sheet. Costs relating to defined contribution plans are included in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period in which they are incurred, and outstanding contributions are included in trade and other payables.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 178 – 
Compensation – Stock Compensation 
("ASC 718")
. 
Share-based compensation is measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Forfeitures and modifications are accounted for as they occur. The Company classifies share-based compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period. For the purposes of calculating the weighted-average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding, the Ordinary Shares underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants issued in the February 2024 Offering and the December 2024 Offering (as defined in Note 9 below) are included. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive given the net loss for each period presented.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a 
greater than 50% likelihood
 of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.
Foreign Currency and Currency Translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net loss for the respective periods.
Prior 
to January 1, 2023 the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries was the Euro. The reporting currency of the Company is USD. The Company translated assets and liabilities in prior periods at the exchange rate

F-
16

in 
effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Unrealized translation gains and losses are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments which are included in the Company’s balance sheet within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Note 3.	FLAC Merger
Prior to November 22, 2022, NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V. was a shell company with no active trade or business, and all relevant assets and liabilities, as well as income and expenses, were borne by NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. FLAC was a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on October 7, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or a similar business combination. FLAC completed its initial public offering on December 11, 2020 and listed on the Nasdaq.
On 
July 25, 2022
, FLAC entered into a Business Combination Agreement (“Business Combination Agreement”) with NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V., the Company, and NewAmsterdam Pharma Investment Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
On November 22, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, the following transactions occurred (collectively, the “Business Combination”).
•
On the date prior to the Closing Date, the shareholders of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. (“Participating Shareholders”) exchanged their interest for Ordinary Shares such that the Company became the direct parent of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. (the “Exchange”). In connection with the Exchange, 
17,016,872
 NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. shares of €

Immediately following the Merger, each outstanding warrant to purchase a Class A ordinary share, par value $
0.0001
 per share, of FLAC became a warrant to purchase 
one
 Ordinary Share, on the same contractual terms which resulted in the issuance of 
167,000
 private placement warrants and 
4,600,000
 public warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”).

F-

•
Each NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. option that was outstanding and unexercised remained outstanding, and to the extent unvested, such option will continue to vest in accordance with its applicable terms, and at the time of the Exchange, such NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. options became options to purchase, and will when exercised be settled in Ordinary Shares.
•
In addition to the transactions described above, 
8,656,330
 Ordinary Shares were issued to Amgen and MTPC pursuant to their profit rights granted upon the acquisition of Dezima.
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting FLAC was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. This determination is primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business Combination, NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V.'s shareholders had the majority of the voting power of the combined entity, NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. comprised all of the ongoing operations of the combined entity, NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V.’s shareholders had the ability to appoint a majority of the governing body of the combined entity, and NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V.’s senior management comprised all of the senior management of the combined entity. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of the Company, immediately following the Exchange, issuing shares for the net assets of FLAC. As of the Closing Date the net assets of FLAC totaled $
67.9
 million which consisted of $
71.9
 million of cash, less liabilities assumed of $
4.0
 million. The Company provided consideration with fair value of $
130.1
 million in the form of Ordinary Shares. The difference between consideration paid and net assets acquired is recorded within additional paid in capital. No goodwill or intangibles were recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V.
Following the Merger, upon the achievement of a certain clinical development milestone, the Company will issue to the Participating Shareholders, Amgen, MTPC and holders of options to purchase shares of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. prior to the closing of the Business Combination, who were directors, officers, employees or consultants of NewAmsterdam Pharma as of the date of the Business Combination Agreement and who are at the time of achievement of such milestone still providing services to the Company (the “Participating Optionholders”), 
1,886,137
 additional Ordinary Shares (the “Earnout Shares”), which in the case of the Participating Optionholders will take the form of awards of restricted stock units.
The Company raised an additional $
234.6
 million in net equity proceeds through a private placement of Ordinary Shares with existing shareholders of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V., FLAC and other new investors (the “PIPE Financing”).
Both the Merger and PIPE Financing closed as of November 22, 2022. Upon consummation of the transactions, the Company’s Ordinary Shares began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker NAMS. The Public Warrants are traded under the ticker NAMSW. The Company also amended existing share-based compensation agreements held by employees of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. prior to the Merger in addition to making additional share-based payments.

Note 4.	Revenue
On June 23, 2022, NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. entered into a licensing agreement with A. Menarini International Licensing S.A. (“Menarini”) (the “Menarini License”), pursuant to which it granted Menarini an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain of its intellectual property and its regulatory documentation to undertake post approval development activities and commercialize multiple brands of obicetrapib, either as a sole active ingredient product or in a fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe (the “Licensed Products”), for any use in the majority of European Countries (“Menarini Territory”).
The Company remains responsible for the development and commercialization costs related to Licensed Products, excluding local development, regulatory and commercialization costs incurred by Menarini in the Menarini Territory. In addition, Menarini is expected to purchase the Licensed Products from the Company in accordance with a supply agreement that is to be executed following the execution of the Menarini License and prior to

F-
18

commercialization. As such, the Company determined that the agreements should not be combined as a single contract pursuant to the guidance prescribed in ASC 606.
The Menarini License includes a non-refundable upfront payment, fixed reimbursements for the Company’s continued development costs, payments based upon the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercial milestones, sales-based royalties, and certain cost sharing payments made by Menarini to the Company and by the Company to Menarini.
The Company has evaluated the Menarini License based on the requirements of ASC 606 and has concluded the following:
Within the license performance obligation described below, there are various licenses granted under the Menarini License which do not currently represent distinct performance obligations in themselves, as the licenses are highly interrelated and Menarini would likely be unable to derive significant benefits from their access to these licenses on an individual basis.
•
The Company, considering that (i) there are no material restrictions included in the contract which would prevent Menarini to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits and (ii) the majority of the Company’s remaining development activities are in late-stage development and are not expected to significantly affect the functionality of the underlying intellectual property, concludes that the license as of the effective date of the contract has standalone value. As such, the Company concluded that the promise in granting the licenses to Menarini is to provide a right to use the Company’s intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted and therefore, revenue accrued and allocated to this performance obligation has been recognized at a point in time.
•
The Company has also identified an additional performance obligation that consists of the research and development activities related to the general development and commercialization costs related to Licensed Products. The Company determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time as Menarini simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services provided as they are performed. This is based on the fact that Menarini is receiving status of the research periodically which allows it to make informed decisions in its local development activities. The Company further considered that the licenses and the research and development services are not highly interdependent or highly interrelated because the Company is able to fulfill its promise to transfer the licenses regardless of fulfilling its promise to perform the remaining research and development services. The Company also concluded that the licenses are considered distinct as Menarini could benefit from the licenses together with readily available resources other than the Company’s research and development services. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method to measure its progress toward completion of its performance obligation and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize each period. The Company believes this is the best measure of progress because other measures do not reflect how the Company transfers its performance obligation to Menarini. In applying the cost-based input method of revenue recognition, the Company uses actual clinical study enrollment figures as well as actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs expected to be incurred attributable to the Menarini Territory for the performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of third-party contract costs relative to the level of patient enrollment in the studies. Revenue will be recognized based on the level of costs incurred relative to the total budgeted costs for the performance obligation.
As such, 
two
 performance obligations for the Menarini License were identified at contract inception, comprising a license to use the Company’s intellectual property
 (the “license performance obligation”) and a promise to continue the development activities for the licensed compound (the “R&D performance obligation”).
The Company’s assessment of the transaction price included an analysis of amounts it expected to receive, which at contract inception consisted of the non-refundable, upfront payment of $
120.9
 million that was received by the Company in July 2022. The Company considers this non-refundable fee to be the initial transaction price.
The Company has allocated the transaction price to each performance obligation identified on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The Company has used a combination of methods to calculate the stand-alone selling prices, using the expected cost plus a margin approach to calculate the standalone selling price of the research and

F-
19

development services required in the Menarini License and needed to commercialize obicetrapib in the Menarini Territory and the residual approach to calculate the stand-alone selling price for the license based on the fair value of the total promised goods and services in the Menarini License considering that the Company has not yet established a price for licenses, has not historically sold licenses on a stand-alone basis (i.e., the selling price is uncertain), and the amount allocated is consistent with the allocation objective as the Company believes the stated upfront amount is consistent with a risk-adjusted price that a market participant would be willing to pay for the licenses.
In 2022, at contract inception, the Company allocated $
98.6
 million to the license performance obligation which was immediately recognized as revenue in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and $
22.3
 million to the R&D performance obligation, which was initially recognized as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet. The revenue related to the R&D performance obligation is recognized over time as costs are incurred in connection with fulfilling the obligation. At each reporting date the Company reviews the total costs incurred to date and the total expected costs necessary to fulfill the R&D performance obligation. Revenue related to the R&D performance obligation is recognized based upon the percentage of total costs expected costs incurred to date based upon the latest information available to management.
The Menarini License also provides for certain milestone payments from Menarini to the Company upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones linked to the enhanced value of the license performance obligation. More specifically, the Company is eligible to receive up to an additional €
863
 million upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, €
30
 million of which has been received as of 
December 31, 2024. These milestones are contingent payments that represent variable consideration that are not initially recognized within the transaction price, due to the scientific uncertainties around the continued development and commercialization of the Licensed Products based on the success of clinical trials. At the end of each reporting period, the Company assessed the probability of significant reversals for any amounts that became likely to be realized prior to recognizing the variable consideration associated with these payments within the transaction price.
In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 the Company recognized revenues of $
27.3
 million, $
5.4
 million and nil, respectively, related to the achievement of clinical milestones. Revenues related to the achievement of milestones under the Menarini License are attributed to the license performance obligation and are recognized when the milestone is achieved.
Additionally, in partial contribution to our costs of development of the Licensed Products, Menarini may pay us €
27.5
 million, payable in two equal annual installments. These development cost contributions are considered to be linked to the R&D performance obligation. Due to the scientific uncertainties around the commercialization of the Licensed Products based on the success of clinical trials, which is not within the control of the Company, the fixed €
27.5
 million is considered constrained at contract inception and is not initially recognized within the transaction price until it becomes highly probable of no significant revenue reversal.
In the year ended December 31, 2024, it was determined that the first installment of the development cost reimbursements was probable to be realized with no significant reversals. As such, the amount of the first installment was added to the transaction price. Based on the percentage of completion of the R&D performance obligation, as described above, $
11.9
 million was recognized as revenue as a cumulative catchup and the remaining $
2.4
 million was recognized as deferred revenue.
The deferred revenue is recognized within current and non-current liabilities based on the expected timing of the associated research and development services. In connection with the Menarini License, the company recognizes as current liabilities the amount for which it expects to perform the associated services within twelve months after the reporting period and the remaining amounts are recognized as non-current liabilities.
Lastly, the Company is entitled to receive tiered royalty payments based on annual aggregate net sales of all Licensed Products in the Menarini Territory, subject to specified reductions upon commercialization. The royalty term begins for each Licensed Product on a country-by-country basis upon the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ends on the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire patent that includes a valid claim, (ii)

F-
20

the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country for such Licensed Product and (iii) a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such country (the term of the agreement). In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from royalty payments at the later of (i) the occurrence of the subsequent sale; or (ii) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based milestone or royalty payments has been allocated has been satisfied. The Company anticipates recognizing these royalty payments if and when subsequent sales are generated from the Licensed Products.
To date the Menarini License has been the only source of revenue to the Company and all such revenues derive from Italy.

The estimated fair value of the Earnout Shares to Participating Shareholders was determined using Level 3 inputs, other than the Company's share price as a Level 1 input, as no observable market inputs were available. The Earnout Shares allocated to Participating Shareholders have been measured at fair value using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Given the assumed zero dividend rate and the fact that no strike price exists that would have led to any volatility measure relative to the Company's share price, the fair value of the Earnout Shares allocated to Participating Shareholders resulting from the Black-Scholes pricing model is entirely driven by the Company’s closing share price as a Level 1 input and the probability of milestone completion as a Level 3 input. 
As such, the relevant inputs to the fair value of the derivative earnout liability are as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2024
 the Company announced positive topline results from its Phase 3 BROOKLYN and BROADWAY clinical trials. Completion of and positive results from the BROOKLYN and BROADWAY trials are the main components of the milestone which is required in order for the Earnout Shares to be issued, excepting completion of certain study reports. The Company has determined that the completion of the BROOKLYN and BROADWAY clinical trial with both clinical trials meeting their primary endpoints increases the estimated probability of achieving the milestone from 
40
% as of December 31, 2023 to 
100
% as of December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
 only Ordinary Shares were outstanding or authorized.

Note 10.	Share-Based Compensation
The Company has four Share-based payment plans and one restricted share award in place as at December 31, 2023:
•
The Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”);
•
The Company’s Supplementary Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Supplementary Plan”);
•
The Company’s Rollover Option Plan (the “Rollover Plan,”);
•
The Company’s Inducement Plan (the “Inducement Plan,” together with the Plan, the Supplementary Plan and the Rollover Plan, the “Plans”); and
•
Chief Executive Officer Restricted Share Award.
Long Term Incentive Plans
The Plans are equity-settled, and the Company may grant various forms of equity awards, including the granting of options to purchase Ordinary Shares (“Company Options”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), pursuant to the Plans. In total, as of December 31, 2024
 a maximum of 
22,049,356
 Ordinary 
Shares may be reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plans. The number of Ordinary Shares reserved for grant under the Plan will increase annually on

F-
24

January 
1 of each calendar year by 
5
% of the then issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares or such lower number as may be determined by the Board of Directors.
The contractual term is 
10
 years from grant date for options granted under the Plans. In general, each Company Option granted in 2023 has a 
four-year
 vesting period with 
25
% vesting after 
one year
 and the remaining 
75
% vesting in equal monthly installments over the next following 
three years
.

Modification of Options
In 2024, a total of 
399,153
 Company Options granted to one employee were modified. For 
210,655
 of the modified Company Options the vesting period was shortened, of which 
200,655
 such modified Company Options also had the exercise period extended. For the other 
188,498
 modified Company Options only the exercise period was extended. The total fair value of the 
210,655
 modified Company Options for which the vesting period was shortened is equal to $
1.2
 million. Any expense previously recognized for such Company Options was reversed on the modification date and the full fair value of the modified Company Options was recognized over the new applicable service period. For the 
188,498
 modified Company Options for which only the exercise period was extended the total fair value of the modification is equal to $
0.1
 million, all of which is recognized on the modification date.
In 2023, the vesting period was shortened for 
490,067
 Company Options granted to an employee in relation with the signing of an employment separation agreement. At the modification date, 
255,243
 Company Options were expected to vest both under the original and the modified vesting conditions. For these Company Options, the modification did not result in any incremental compensation cost. For the 
234,824
 Company Options that were not probable to vest as of the modification date based on the original terms, the incremental fair value granted is equal to the fair value of the modified award of $
12.19
 (i.e., the value of the modified award, as determined on the modification date, compared to its prior zero value). In 2023, the total incremental fair value of $
2.9
 million has been fully recognized over the remaining modified requisite service period.
The changes for the year ended

Expected Term
The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). The Company utilizes this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla nature of the Company’s stock-based awards.
Expected Volatility
Since the Company was privately held through November 2022, it alone does not have sufficient relevant company-specific historical data to support its expected volatility alone. In prior periods, due to the insufficiency of historical volatility data on the Company’s own securities, the expected volatility input was determined using comparable companies alone. Beginning on January 1, 2024 expected volatility input was determined using a weighted average calculation considering the volatility of the Company’s own securities and the volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. Initially, the volatility of the Company’s Ordinary Shares is assigned a weighting of 
10
%. This weighting will be increased by 
5
% per calendar quarter (i.e. to 
15
% in Q2 2024, 
20
% in Q3 2024 and 
25
% in Q4 2024), until the expected volatility input is based entirely on the historical volatility of the Company’s Ordinary Shares. For purposes of identifying comparable companies, the Company selected companies with comparable characteristics, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, with a term that approximates the expected life of the option.
Expected Dividend
The expected dividend rate is zero as the Company currently has no history or expectation of declaring dividends on its ordinary shares.
Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)
As at December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company had allocated 
143,002
 and 
143,002
 Earnout Shares, respectively, to be granted to Participating Optionholders if and when a certain clinical development milestone is achieved during the earnout period. These Earnout Shares will be delivered in the form of awards of RSUs (the "Earnout RSUs") granted pursuant to the Plan to such Participating Optionholders who are, at the time of achievement of such milestone, still providing services to the Company.
The development milestone consists of the achievement and public announcement of Positive Phase 3 Data for each of the Company’s BROADWAY clinical trial and BROOKLYN clinical trial at any time during the period beginning on November 22, 2022 and ending on the date that is five years after such date.
Prior to 2024 
no
 expense was recognized in relation to the Earnout RSUs as the milestone was not deemed probable to occur. During 2024 the probability of the milestone completion was reassessed and the milestone was deemed probable to occur. Therefore, the Company began to recognize expense in relation to the Earnout RSUs in accordance with ASC 718.
The following summarizes the share-based payment expensed recognized by type of award and line-item:

Chief Executive Officer Restricted Share Award
In July 2021, our chief executive officer, Michael Davidson, M.D., paid the fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares (in aggregate $
838,806
) when he made an investment in restricted shares issued through Depositary Receipts. The total fair value of these equity-settled share-based payment awards amounts to nil and there will be no expenses recognized in the income statement. This award had a 
four year
 vesting period with 
25
% vesting on August 1, 2021 and the remaining 
75
% vesting in equal monthly installments over the following 
three years
.
In connection with the award arrangement, if Dr. Davidson leaves the Company, all unvested Ordinary Shares will be cancelled against payment by the Company to him of the lower of the (i) the purchase price paid and (ii) the fair market value of such Ordinary Shares at the time of forfeiture. In order to reflect the consideration paid and the possibility that the Ordinary Shares would be repurchased if Dr. Davidson becomes a "Good Leaver" (as such term is defined in the award agreement) during the vesting period, the Company has recognized the consideration as a financial liability until the award has fully vested, at which time it will be reclassified to equity provided that Dr. Davidson remains with the Company. This liability is measured at the lower of (i) the purchase price paid and (ii) the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares at the end of the reporting period. The liability for unvested Ordinary Shares as at December 31, 2024 and 2023
 amounted to 
nil
 and $
0.1
 million, respectively.
For the year ended 
December 31, 2024, the movements in the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding are as follows:

Note 11. Segment Information
The Company has 
one
 operating segment and, therefore, 
one
 reportable segment, which comprises the discovery, development and commercialization of transformative therapies for cardio-metabolic diseases.
To date the Menarini License has been the only source of revenue to the Company and all such revenues derive from Italy. The nature of the revenues are described in detail in Note 4 - Revenue.
The chief operating decision maker assesses performance and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net loss and earnings/(loss) before tax, adjusted for certain non-cash and non-operating items such as share-based compensation, change in fair value of derivatives and foreign currency gains or losses.
 Adjusted

F-
27

earnings/(loss) 
before taxes is used to monitor budget versus actuals and evaluate the operations of the Company. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets. The future prospects of the Company are highly dependent upon the results of its ongoing clinical trials and interactions with regulatory agencies. Such results and interactions are utilized together with assessment of the comparison of budget versus actuals in order to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources.
The following table presents the adjusted earnings/(loss) before taxes for the Company's single segment for each of the years ended December 31,

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income, if any, the timing and the amount of which are uncertain. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant component of objective negative evidence evaluated was our cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future

F-
29

growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as at December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023
, the Company had a valuation allowance of $
184.6
 million and $
129.8
 million, respectively, representing an increase of $54.8 million. The valuation allowance is recorded on the balance sheet. A valuation allowance is a non-cash charge, and does not limit the Company’s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, including its ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforward amounts, against future taxable income. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
As of December 31, 2024
, we had net operating loss carryforwards for Netherlands fiscal unity, US, and state income tax purposes of $
420.3
 million, $
111.1
 million, and $
39.2
 million, respectively. We also have federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
1.9
 million that expire beginning in 2043 and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
0.7
 million which can be carried forward indefinitely.
The future utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and credits may be subject to an annual limitation, due to Dutch and US tax law and as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations will not impact our effective tax rate.
We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition at the effective date to be recognized. As of December 31, 2024
 we have 
no
t identified any unrecognized tax benefits that should be recorded.
We have elected to include interest and penalties as a component of tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, we did 
no
t recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. Although the timing and outcome of an income tax audit is highly uncertain, we do not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change during the next 12 months.
With an effective date of November 21, 2022, NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V. formed a fiscal unity with NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. and NewAmsterdam Pharma B.V. for corporate income tax purposes. A company and its subsidiaries that are part of the fiscal unity are jointly and severally liable for the tax payable by the fiscal unity.
We are subject to taxation in the United States, the Netherlands and various state jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024
, the tax years for 2021, 2022, and 2023 are subject to examination by the tax authorities in the United States and the tax year for 2023 is subject to examination by the tax authorities in the Netherlands. Due to our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, the income tax returns remain open to U.S. federal and state tax examinations. The Company is not currently under examination in any tax jurisdiction.

Note 13.	Net Loss per Ordinary Share
As discussed in Note 3, in connection with the Business Combination the Participating Shareholders exchanged their interest in the outstanding shares of NewAmsterdam Pharma Holding B.V. for shares in the Company at a ratio of approximately 
2.13
. In order to present net loss per ordinary share on a comparable basis across all periods, the number of ordinary shares outstanding prior to the Business Combination have been adjusted for the exchange ratio of approximately 
2.13
 for the purposes of calculating the number of weighted average shares outstanding.
Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share was calculated as follows:

Note 14.	Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan for its U.S. employees (the "US Plan") and a defined contribution pension plan for its employees in the Netherlands (the "NL Plan"). The US Plan allows eligible employees to voluntarily defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis, subject to the maximum annual amounts as set periodically by the IRS. The Company makes matching contributions of 
100
% of the first 
3
% of employee contributions and 
50
% of the next 
2
% of employee contributions. The NL Plan provides for a monthly, pre-tax contribution by the Company of 
15
% of an employee's gross income, subject to statutory maximums. The Company made matching contributions of $
0.5
 million, $
0.1
 million and $
0.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively. Company contributions vest immediately for each participant.

Note 15.	Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
The Company has entered into a variety of agreements financial commitments in the normal course of business with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and other third parties for preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing services. The terms generally provide us with the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Payments due upon cancellation generally consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancellable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. However, some of our service providers also charge cancellation fees upon cancellation. The amount and timing of such payments are not known, but at December 31, 2024
 they are estimated to be a maximum of $
14.2
 million.
According to the terms of the Menarini License the Company will be responsible for development and commercialization costs related to Licensed Products other than those in the Menarini Territory. In addition, under specified conditions of the agreement, we agreed to bear 
50
% of certain development costs incurred by the other party in the development of the Licensed Products in the Menarini Territory.

Note 16.	Related Parties
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may enter into transactions with entities that are associated with a party that meets the criteria of a related party of the Company. These transactions are reviewed quarterly and to date have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
