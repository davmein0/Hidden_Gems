Item 1. Business.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy through the development of innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases. We believe cell therapies are one of the forward pillars of medicine, and our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective and more broadly accessible. Although cell therapies have shown benefits to date, cell therapies have primarily been constrained to existing biologic structures, which has limited their impact and opportunity. Our novel synthetic binding scaffold, the D-Domain, is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts). Existing cell therapy solutions, most of which use a biologic-based, single chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domain, tend to be difficult to manufacture, beneficial to a limited segment of patients, often result in high toxicity, and have narrow applicability in treatable indications. We believe we can address these limitations by engineering a new class of D-Domain powered cell therapies, including classical single infusion CAR-Ts called “ddCARs” and dosable and controllable universal CAR-Ts called “ARC-SparX”, to address hematologic cancers, solid tumors, and indications outside of oncology, such as autoimmune diseases.

Our lead program is a BCMA-targeting ddCAR product candidate called anitocabtagene autoleucel or “anito-cel” (formerly, CART-ddBCMA), which is currently being evaluated in our pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 and the Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trials in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM). We have partnered anito-cel with Kite Pharma Inc., a Gilead company (Kite), through our co-development/co-commercialization collaboration agreement, as described in more detail in “Licenses and Collaborations” below (the Kite Collaboration Agreement). Recently, Kite initiated a global Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial (iMMagine-3) of anito-cel in patients with second through fourth line rrMM. Kite will manufacture anito-cel for iMMagine-3. This followed the completion of the technical transfer to Kite, which was announced in May 2024, as well as the transfer of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for anito-cel in rrMM, which has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Outside of our collaboration with Kite, we intend to evaluate anito-cel for the treatment of certain non-oncology indications, including some autoimmune disorders. We received FDA clearance of an IND application and have initiated a Phase 1 trial in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in 2024.

We also are developing two clinical-stage ARC-SparX programs in Phase 1 trials: ACLX-001, which targets BCMA in rrMM; and our wholly-owned ACLX-002, which targets CD123 in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In November 2023, Kite exercised its option under the Kite Collaboration Agreement to negotiate a license for ACLX-001.

In December 2024, at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), we presented preliminary data from our pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial evaluating anito-cel, in patients with rrMM. We believe these results, along with the data from our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating anito-cel in rrMM, further demonstrate that our D-Domain technology can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefits. As of the October 31, 2024 data cutoff date for the iMMagine-1 ASH presentation, 86 patients were evaluable for efficacy based on a follow-up of at least two months after treatment with anito-cel, and 98 patients were evaluable for safety based on a follow-up of at least one month after treatment with anito-cel. Data were assessed using the 2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria for MM. For more information regarding the IMWG uniform response criteria for MM, see the section entitled “Our Multiple Myeloma Program - anito-cel: Phase 1 Trial in rrMM” below. All patients in iMMagine-1 received a single infusion of anito-cel (target dose of 115×10
6
 CAR+ T cells).

Key highlights from the preliminary data presented for iMMagine-1 as of the October 31, 2024 data cutoff date are as follows:

•
For the 86 efficacy evaluable patients with median follow-up of 9.5 months, per IMWG criteria:

•
97% (83 of 86) overall response rate (ORR) achieved;

1

•
53 of 86 (62%) patients achieved complete response (CR) or a stringent complete response (sCR); and

•
70 of 86 (81%) patients achieved very good partial response (VGPR) or higher.

•
Of those evaluable for MRD testing (n=58), 54 (93%) were MRD-negative at a minimum of 10
-5 
sensitivity.

•
Median progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were not reached, as less than half of all dosed subjects had experienced an event of progression or death. 

•
Using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, which calculates the cumulative survival probability in any given length of time through analysis of subjects who have had an event (death or progression) within specified time intervals:

•
PFS rates, which reflect the percentage of patients who are alive and have not progressed, at 6 and 12 months were 93% and 79%, respectively;

•
OS rates, which reflect the percentage of patients who are alive at 6 and 12 months were 97% and 97%, respectively.

•
For the 98 safety evaluable patients, anito-cel continues to be well-tolerated. 

•
No delayed or non-ICANS neurotoxicities, including no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome, have been observed in more than 150 patients dosed with anito-cel.

•
Cytopenias were the most common Grade ≥3 TEAEs; 53 patients (54%) had Grade ≥3 neutropenia, 20 (20%) had Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, and 22 (22%) had Grade ≥3 anemia.

•
84 of 98 patients (86%) experienced Grade 1 or lower cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including 17 (17%) with no CRS. Any grade CRS was observed in 81 patients (83%) with 67 (68%) Grade 1, 13 (13%) Grade 2, and 1 (1%) Grade 5.

•
Any grade ICANS was observed in 9 patients (9%) with 4 (4%) Grade 1, 4 (4%) Grade 2, and 1 (1%) Grade 3. All cases of ICANS resolved.

•
Three deaths occurred in the 117 patients treated in iMMagine-1 due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (related or unrelated to anito-cel: retroperitoneal hemorrhage, CRS, and fungal infection).

•
In the safety evaluable population, 85 of 98 patients (87%) were triple refractory, and 41 of 98 patients (42%) were penta refractory. Patients received a median of four prior lines of therapy, with 45 of 98 patients (46%) having received three prior lines.

Additionally, in December 2024, at the Annual Meeting of the ASH, we presented updated data from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for anito-cel for the treatment of rrMM. As of the October 3, 2024, data cutoff date, 38 patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy analysis using IMWG uniform response criteria for MM. These evaluable patients comprised the dose escalation cohorts for the first dose level (DL1) (n=6), the second dose level (DL2) (n=6), and a dose expansion cohort of DL1 (n=26).

Key highlights from the data presented are as follows:

•
For the 38 efficacy evaluable patients with median follow-up of 38.1 months, per IMWG criteria:

•
100% ORR achieved;

•
30 of 38 (79%) patients achieved CR or sCR; and

•
35 of 38 (92%) patients achieved VGPR or higher.

•
Of those evaluable for MRD testing (n=28), 25 (89%) were MRD-negative at a minimum of 10
-5 
sensitivity.

2

•
With a median follow-up of 38.1 months, median OS was not reached and the estimated Kaplan-Meier median PFS for the study population was 30.2 months. 

•
The safety profile was manageable and consistent with prior data presentations, including no delayed or non-ICANS neurotoxicities observed, including no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Overall, patients enrolled in the Phase 1 trial had poor prognostic factors with 26 of 38 (68%) patients being penta-refractory and all 38 patients being triple refractory, with a median of four prior lines of therapy. 20 of 38 (53%) patients were aged 65 or older at time of dosing. 26 of 38 (68%) patients had at least one high-risk prognostic feature, defined as a patient with extramedullary disease (EMD); International Staging System (ISS) Stage III (defined as serum ß2 micro globulin value that is greater than or equal to 5.5 mg/L); High Risk Cytogenetics (Del17p, t(14;16), or t(4;14)); or greater than or equal to 60% bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC). Patients with these high-risk prognostic features have been reported to experience lower CR rates and shorter duration of response (DOR) in clinical trials of other BCMA-targeting CAR-T therapies. All patients enrolled scored 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale and the subtypes of MM were representative of the natural distribution of MM subtypes.

We believe the preliminary results from our pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial along with the Phase 1 trial of anito-cel demonstrate the potential for anito-cel to become a best-in-class treatment for patients suffering from rrMM, including those considered high risk. MM is the third most common hematological malignancy in the United States and Europe, with approximately 35,000 new cases diagnosed per year in the United States. Although changes in the treatment landscape for MM have increased the rates of and depth of response (antitumor activity), MM is currently considered incurable; and patients typically have a life expectancy of just over five years. We estimate that the size of the global MM market was approximately $25 billion in 2024 and that the current total addressable global CAR-T market for rrMM to be $12 billion or more based on the number of patients who are receiving second line treatments and beyond.

Based on our recent discussions with the FDA, we believe that results from our iMMagine-1 Phase 2 clinical trial, if positive, together with the results from our Phase 1 trial could be sufficient to support the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We are also rapidly pursuing clinical development of anito-cel in earlier lines of therapy through our Phase 3 iMMagine-3 clinical trial in second through fourth line rrMM in collaboration with Kite. In November 2024, we announced the first patient dosed iMMagine-3, which is being manufactured by Kite, and followed the completion of the technical transfer of our cell manufacturing to Kite earlier in 2024. As described in more detail in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Kite to co-develop and co-commercialize anito-cel as well as other autologous and non-autologous CAR-T cell therapies that use the same D-domain BCMA binder for the treatment of MM, pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement.

We have summarized our preclinical and clinical programs in the pipeline chart below and indicated where such programs are subject to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, which is described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below. Except for such partnered programs, we have worldwide rights to all our programs.

* Kite exercised its option to negotiate a license for ACLX-001 and retains one remaining option for a select ARC-SparX program in multiple myeloma and lymphoma

Outside our collaboration with Kite, we are also advancing anito-cel into select autoimmune disorders. We recently initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of anito-cel in generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by severe muscle weakness. In gMG, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks proteins in the neuromuscular junction, disrupting neuromuscular signaling and preventing muscle contraction. We believe anito-cel's mechanism in targeting plasma cells through BCMA may be a relevant mechanism to address the underlying pathogenesis of disease. We estimate that gMG affects over 70,000 people in the United States and there is no known cure.

We are also advancing our novel ARC-SparX programs, including our clinical-stage programs, ACLX-001 in rrMM and wholly-owned ACLX-002 in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ARC-SparX are adaptable versions of ddCARs where the antigen-targeting region is located on a SparX protein that can be dosed separately from the ARC-T cells, our proprietary D-Domain based universal CAR-T-cells that are designed to activate only when bound to a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell. We believe that controlling ARC-T activation with SparX protein effectively separates the antigen-recognition and killing functions, which allows for a more controlled, modular approach to CAR-T therapy, as SparX dosing may be modified over the course of treatment to reduce toxicities, multiple SparX proteins may be incorporated to address antigen heterogeneity, and additional functionality (i.e., logic-gating) may be designed to expand the utility of CAR-T therapy. Further, the approach has potential to simplify the manufacturing and the regulatory path of multiple CAR-T programs, as the ARC-T programs can utilize the same vector and express the same binding domain. Our preclinical studies of our ARC-SparX product candidates have demonstrated that ARC-T cells can be activated by different SparX proteins that target different antigens suggesting that ARC-SparX can potentially address antigen heterogeneity, and thereby address some harder to treat indications.

We initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of ACLX-001, the first product candidate developed under our ARC-SparX platform, for the treatment of rrMM in the second quarter of 2022. ACLX-001 is an immunotherapeutic combination composed of our ARC-T-cells and SparX proteins that target BCMA. This trial is intended to establish an ARC-SparX dosing regimen and prepare for ARC-SparX trials in expanded indications. In November 2023, Kite exercised its option under the Kite Collaboration Agreement to negotiate a license for ACLX-001. Our lead ARC-SparX indication is AML/MDS, for which we have multiple SparX in development targeting different antigens. We initiated the Phase 1 clinical trial for ACLX-002, an ARC-SparX product candidate targeting CD123, for the treatment of AML/MDS in the fourth quarter of 2022.

We believe we have built a broad and scalable pipeline that positions us to capitalize on the potential of our proprietary platform technologies and potentially achieve long-term growth and sustainability within the field of cell therapy. We believe our therapeutic approaches, ddCAR and ARC-SparX, will enable us to select mechanisms that are most appropriate for each target and indication we may choose to pursue based on underlying disease biology and patient need, such as in solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We are also integrating AI-powered discovery and computational tools to expand the applicability of our platforms.

Our D-Domain platform has broad potential utility for additional cell modalities, targets, therapeutic areas and applications and we plan to expand our pipeline beyond hematologic and solid cancers to autoimmune disease, as well as to allogeneic and other cell types, including through our collaboration with Kite. We believe our preliminary clinical data for anito-cel have demonstrated that D-Domains can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefits. Our D-Domain platform consists of structurally unique binders that are small and stable, which can be consistently manufactured. They can also be modified to generate diverse libraries of proprietary target- binding domains. The small size and structure of our D-Domain binders compared to other antigen binding domains used in CAR constructs, such as scFvs, are illustrated above. In our preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that CARs with D-Domains exhibit higher transduction efficiency, higher surface expression, and lower tonic signaling than CARs with scFvs, which we believe can lead to cell therapies with improved therapeutic benefit and reduced toxicity. From our clinical trials of anito-cel, we reported preliminary data that we believe supports efficacy and safety benefits, as well as potential manufacturability advantages associated with our D-Domain technology.

The recent availability of cell therapy products, such as CAR-T-cells, introduced an unprecedented “living therapeutic” modality that offers benefits well beyond what previous oncology modalities offered. For the first time, these therapeutics directly harness the strength of the patient’s own immune system to significantly reduce, even potentially eradicate, tumors. While CAR-T and other genetically modified cell therapies have shown significant progress in extending or improving the lives of patients who often have no other treatment options, there remain limitations to their broader use, including variable long-term efficacy, significant adverse effects, narrow applicability, and limited access. Our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective, and broadly accessible. We plan to achieve this goal by maximizing the impact of our proprietary D-Domain binders, which may enable CAR-Ts to have distinct advantages that address these limitations, including achieving promising preliminary clinical data with high ORR and durable responses, potentially differentiated safety profile, opportunity to treat a broader group of patients, and potential manufacturability advantages through our D-Domain technology and the partnership with an experienced CAR-T company (see Kite Collaboration Agreement), as detailed in the section entitled “Cell Therapy Background & Current Limitations” below.

The foundation of our competitive advantage is our proprietary technology, clinical evidence, track record of execution, manufacturing success, and assembly of a proven management team. We believe these advantages, and our recent partnership around our lead program anito-cel with global cell therapy leader, Kite, position us to achieve significant market share in a large and attractive market and to ultimately transform the cell therapy market, contributing to a significant advancement in medicine.

Our Team

Our team and culture are critical to realizing our vision of reimagining cell therapy as one of the future pillars of medicine.

We are led by a diverse team of executives with significant experience in business, discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of differentiated and novel therapies specifically in the fields of oncology, cell therapy and rare diseases. Rami Elghandour, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer at Nevro where he grew the company from a small private company to a publicly traded commercial organization with nearly $400 million in revenue. Prior to Nevro, Mr. Elghandour was an investor with Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation where he led several investments, including Nevro’s Series B financing. Our Chief Medical Officer, Christopher Heery, M.D., an oncologist by training, was the former Head of Clinical Trials Group for the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology at the National Cancer Institute, and previously served as Chief Medical Officer at Precision Biosciences and Bavarian Nordic. Our Chief Financial Officer, Michelle Gilson, was previously a senior equity research analyst covering the biotechnology sector, most recently as a Managing Director at Canaccord Genuity.

We have attracted a diverse and talented group of innovators and company builders to help us execute our strategy and to build a transformative cell therapy platform company. Collectively, we are driven by our shared purpose and our values.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 163 full-time employees and we are committed to continuing to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive organization. We believe focusing on diversity and inclusion is not only the right thing to do but is also a competitive advantage. We also believe talent is equally distributed across gender, ethnicity and is not overly represented in any single group. As such, we believe focusing on building high performance teams naturally leads to building diverse teams. We are purposeful in our efforts to create a culture and environment that attracts and retains top talent, including talent from underrepresented groups as reflected in the diversity throughout our organization:

•
Total Company: 54% female; 74% diverse (gender, racial & ethnic representation);

•
Board of Directors: 43% female; 86% diverse;

•
Executive Leadership: 60% female; 90% diverse;

•
Directors roles: 41% female; 59% diverse;

6

•
Managers and senior scientists with managerial responsibilities: 45% female; 63% diverse; and

•
Technical and Scientific roles: 48% female; 67% diverse.

Demographics are self-reported and diversity numbers are representative of both gender and ethnic diversity.  Our commitment to diversity does not stop within the walls of our organization. With our mission of advancing humanity, we believe in equitable access to healthcare. Inclusive research programs that encompass real-world patient populations can contribute to addressing racial inequality in healthcare. We are dedicated to expanding representation within our clinical trials. We also believe deeply in corporate social responsibility and being conscious stewards in our society. We are devoted to leveraging our science to make a positive impact for the patient and local communities we serve.  As our organization expands, we intend to grow our community involvement and outreach efforts and establish our corporate brand as a force for good through corporate philanthropy, patient advocacy, and employee volunteerism.

Cell Therapy Background & Current Limitations

Background

T-cells are a key component of the immune system that can target diseased cells for elimination through the recognition of cell surface antigens. A growing understanding of the immune system over the years and advances in cell, gene and protein engineering have led to approved genetically modified cell therapy products.

Genetically modified cell therapy involves isolating immune cells, modifying them outside of the patient’s body and then reintroducing them into the patient to destroy diseased cells. Such cell therapies have largely focused on using the patient’s own T-cells (autologous approach) to express engineered antigen receptor complexes, such as TCRs or CARs. The extracellular binding domain of the TCR or CAR recognizes the antigen, and, after the T cell binds with the cell expressing the antigen, the intracellular signaling domain induces cell killing and activates pathways specific for the T cell’s proliferation and survival.

The recent availability of cell therapy products introduced an unprecedented “living therapeutic” modality that offers benefits well beyond what previous oncology modalities offered. For the first time, these therapeutics directly harness the strength of the patient’s own immune system to significantly reduce, even potentially eradicate, tumors. Initially evaluated in indications where patients were refractory to multiple lines of therapy and had generally exhausted their therapeutic options, adoptive cell therapies have shown response rates that exceed many other available modalities, and are now being evaluated in earlier line settings. Particularly striking is that these responses are achieved with a single, personalized administration of the cell therapy, generally achieving rapid and durable responses with toxicities resolving in days to weeks. This transformative therapy results in extended quality of life benefits without maintenance or additional treatment.

As of December 31, 2024, there are seven FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies:

•
Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with rrMM after four or more prior lines of therapy; 

•
Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with rrMM after four or more prior lines of therapy; 

•
Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) that is refractory to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy within 12 months or are also ineligible for stem cell transplantation, and relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy; 

•
Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy; 

•
Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL;

7

•
Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adult patients with LBCL that is refractory to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, and relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy; and 

•
Aucatzyl (obecabtagene autoleucel), which has been approved by the FDA for treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL.

Hematologic cancers represent a robust and growing market opportunity for CAR-T cell therapies. These cancers, which include leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, account for approximately 10% of all cancer incidence in 2020. Sales of CAR-T therapies in hematologic cancers exceeded $4.5 billion in 2024, representing year over year growth of 22%.

Current Limitations

While CAR-T and other genetically modified cell therapies have shown significant progress in extending the lives of patients who often have no other treatment options, there are limitations to their broader use, including:

•
Variable Long-Term Efficacy
: FDA-approved CAR-Ts may offer higher response rates compared to other available therapies, but efficacy as measured by the DOR is highly variable between different CAR-T programs and also within the same program for different patients. Further, unmet need remains for patients with high-risk prognostic features, such as EMD within rrMM, who experience worse outcomes in clinical trials of other BCMA-targeting CAR-T therapies than non-EMD patients, and often do not achieve deep, durable responses.      

•
Significant Adverse Effects
: Some cell therapies also have the potential to cause several adverse effects. Uncontrolled cellular expansion and potentially related side effects such as non-ICANS/delayed neurotoxicities (Parkinsonism, cranial nerve palsies, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) as well as other potential off-tumor toxicities may stifle the broader use of these therapies in several key ways. Specifically, they may limit the number of patients that are eligible for treatment, complicate adoption into earlier lines of treatment, preclude the use of these therapies in the non-academic and outpatient settings, and increase costs to patients, payers and providers due to the need for intensive care unit access when they are used.  

•
Narrow Applicability
: Currently, CAR-T and other genetically modified cell therapies are utilized in only a few hematological oncology indications. Their activity in most tumors is primarily driven by a limited number of tumor specific antigen targets. Their utility is further limited by secondary resistance mechanisms arising in the relapsed or refractory settings, as well as the antigen heterogeneity that is characteristic of some of these diseases.  

•
Limited Access: 
  Due to the potential for severe toxicities, the limited number of safe and efficacious targets, supply constraints due to manufacturing complexity and scalability of processes, length of the regulatory process, and the substantial capital requirements for bringing cell therapies to market at scale, CAR-Ts are still not widely available for oncology patients. Supply constraints have been specifically cited as a limiting factor for access to FDA-approved BCMA CAR-Ts since their launches. Further, FDA-approved CAR-Ts are primarily administered and managed in authorized treatment centers, which represent approximately 7% of oncology/hematology practices in the United States.

Our Solution

Our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective, and broadly accessible. We plan to achieve this goal by maximizing the impact of our proprietary D-Domain binders, which enable CAR-Ts to have distinct advantages including:

•
Promising Clinical Data
–
High ORR and Durable Responses: 
In our iMMagine-1 clinical trial of anito-cel in patients with rrMM, for the 86 patients evaluable for efficacy evaluation, we reported an ORR of 97%, a complete response/stringent complete response (CR/sCR) rate of 62%, and 12-month PFS rate of 79% with a median follow up of 9.5 months. In our Phase 1 trial of anito-cel in 38 patients with rrMM, we reported an ORR of 100%, a CR/sCR rate of 79%, and median PFS of 30 months with a median follow up of 38 months. We believe these results demonstrate the capability of D-Domains not only to effectively bind target antigens and drive CAR-T cell proliferation but also to enable efficient killing of a substantial proportion of tumor cells. High cell surface expression and low propensity for tonic signaling of D-Domains may enable more effective interactions between the CAR and the antigen as well as reduced T-cell exhaustion, which may explain the rapid and long-term responses currently observed in our Phase 1 and iMMagine-1 clinical trials.  

8

•
Potentially Differentiated Safety Profile:
 We believe the small and stable structure of the D-Domain enables a high transduction rate, resulting in a high proportion of cells expressing the CAR construct on the cell surface (CAR+ cells), as we observed in our clinical trials of anito-cel. A high proportion of CAR+ cells lowers the total number of T-cells required to be administered which we believe may yield a therapy with an improved toxicity profile, consistent with currently available results of the clinical trials of anito-cel. In our clinical trials of anito-cel, we did not observe any non-ICANS/delayed neurotoxicities, including no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome in the entire population through the follow-up period. Additionally, a 2022 cross-trial safety analysis on CAR-Ts by the FDA supports this concept, finding lower transduction frequency in the CAR-T product was significantly associated with higher rates of severe CRS.

•
Opportunity to Treat a Broader Group of Patients:
 We believe the preliminary positive results of our clinical trials of anito-cel underscores the advantages conferred by our D-Domain binders. The potential safety profile may allow for increased access through outpatient dosing and ability to discharge patients sooner. Additionally, we plan to continue to expand our pipeline of D-Domain based CAR-Ts to a wider variety of indications in the future. Based on the differentiation of the D-Domain, and the breadth and depth of our D-Domain libraries, we believe we can expand to a broader group of patients, including those with heterogeneous tumor antigen expression and antigen targets that might be difficult to target. We are currently developing therapies within both our ddCAR and ARC-SparX platforms to treat a broad variety of indications, starting with rrMM, AML/MDS, gMG and, in the future, solid tumors.   

•
Potential Advantages from D-Domain Manufacturability and Experienced CAR-T Partner: 
We believe the manufacturing data from our clinical trials of anito-cel demonstrate the potential manufacturing advantages conferred by D-Domains vs. scFv and biologics-based constructs used in CAR-T therapies. Along with the experience and established CAR-T infrastructure offered by our Kite Collaboration Agreement, which has resulted in high success rates and reliability in delivering their currently marketed products, we are encouraged by our combined potential to mitigate the supply constraints which have limited BCMA CAR-T launches to date. Further, we believe the Kite Collaboration Agreement and the associated economic terms substantially limits our need for additional capital to build out commercial manufacturing infrastructure. 

The foundation of our proprietary platform is our D-Domain technology, that has generated promising initial clinical data. We believe our D-Domain technology is a transformational platform that enables us to take the right approach for the right indication within cell therapy. The strengths of the D-Domains are its size, stability, and structure which make it a unique and essential building block for making next generation CAR-Ts to unlock the potential of this therapeutic category which is poised to be one of the forward pillars of medicine. Our method of generating D-Domains, and the individual binders themselves are protected in our patent portfolio, which as of December 31, 2024, includes 34 U.S. and foreign patents and over 90 U.S. and foreign pending applications.

We are generating D-Domains against multiple targets which can then be deployed to create a new class of D-Domain powered cell therapies, including ddCAR and ARC-SparX CAR-T therapies, to address hematologic cancers, solid tumors, and indications outside of oncology such as autoimmune diseases. ddCARs are single infusion CAR-Ts enhanced with our D-Domains as the antigen recognition motif. ARC-SparX are adaptable versions of ddCARs where the SparX protein is dosed separately from the ARC-T cell. Our ARC-T-cells are dosable, controllable, universal CAR-Ts designed to activate only when combined with a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell.

9

ddCAR Platform

We use our ddCAR platform to generate single infusion therapies where our D-Domain binder replaces the scFvs. The ddCAR is composed of an intracellular T cell signaling domain similar to traditional CARs fused to our D-Domain, which functions as the extracellular antigen binding region. Upon engagement with the antigen on a target cell, the ddCAR signals to activate the T cell to kill the target cell.

The D-Domain was developed to overcome limitations of existing CAR-T therapies by employing a novel synthetic binding domain as a replacement to the traditionally used antigen binding domains for conventional CAR-T therapies, known as scFvs. The result is a structurally unique binder that is small, stable, and can be modified to generate a diverse library of proprietary target-binding domains.

10

Structurally Unique D-Domains
: The unique structural features of our D-Domain may confer the unique combination of properties we observe in our ddCAR product candidates, such as high cell surface expression, high proportion of CAR+ cells (high transduction rate), and low tonic signaling, which we believe have contributed to the efficacy, safety, and manufacturability profile observed in our clinical trials of our lead program anito-cel.  D-Domains are short polypeptides that spontaneously fold into a stable triple alpha-helical structure. The D-Domain is derived from a 73 amino acid synthetic protein, α-3D, that has no known homolog in nature or apparent function as first described in a paper by Walsh, et al. that appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 1999. This domain is devoid of post-translational glycosylation or disulfide bonds leading to consistent manufacturability via microbial, fungal or mammalian protein expression. Additional key structural features of the D-Domain are as follows:

•
Small Size
:
 The figure below showcases the small size of the 8kDa D-Domain compared to other antigen binding domains used in CAR constructs such as the scFv and bi-valent camelid VHh structure of approximately 25kDa. A smaller antigen binding domain will decrease the overall lentiviral construct size which may improve transduction efficiency. The small antigen binding domain may also function to improve the immunological synapse formation and thus CAR-T cell killing. 

•
Hydrophobic Core
: The figure below depicts the three-dimensional structure of the D-Domain highlighting the triple alpha helical bundle with the tight hydrophobic core (in red). The hydrophobic core results in ultrafast folding kinetics of the D-Domain creating a stable structure when expressed in cells. 

11

•
Stability
:
 D-Domains are highly stable proteins compared to scFvs which facilitates the high expression of CARs on T-cells and manufacturing of SparX proteins. As shown in the middle panels of the figure below, using size exclusion chromatography, we have demonstrated that a higher level of monomeric protein content can be purified from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing D-Domain-based SparX proteins compared to scFv, indicating lower levels of aggregation of the D-Domain based SparX proteins and thus greater stability. In addition, we have tested the thermal stability of D-Domains as compared to a PD-L1 binding scFv by heating them to temperatures about 100 degrees Celsius and measuring the retention of PD-L1 binding. As shown in the panels on the far right, D-Domains that were heated to the indicated temperatures retained greater PD-L1 binding as compared to the PD-L1-binding scFv, demonstrating the thermal stability of the D-Domains. 

When utilized in CARs, we believe the structural properties of the D-Domain translate into unique benefits of high transduction rates, high cell surface expression, and low tonic signaling. To modify the binding properties of the D-Domain, we can vary the amino acids on the D-Domain scaffold. In the context of ddCARs, we believe the D-Domain structure creates an efficient and scalable cell manufacturing process, as demonstrated by our high CAR+ rate, yield, and viability of cell product made to date. See “Manufacturing and Delivery—anito-cel Cell and ARC-T Cell.”

•
High Transduction Rate
: 
In the manufacturing of 38 lots of anito-cel in our Phase 1 clinical trial, the median transduction rate was 70%. In the manufacturing of 117 lots of anito-cel in iMMagine-1, the median transduction rate was 62%. We believe this high transduction efficiency may improve product consistency and reduce the number of untransduced T-cells administered to patients that do not contribute to efficacy but may contribute to toxicity. Our high transduction rate compares favorably with previously published Phase 1 data regarding the transduction rates for Abecma (then known as bb2121) and Carvykti (then known as JNJ-4528), as shown in the left panel of the figure below. While we believe these data suggest that anito-cel has a meaningful advantage in transduction efficiency over existing CAR-T therapies, these data are based on a cross-trial comparison and not a head-to-head clinical trial and may not be directly comparable due to differences in trial designs and methodologies. As manufacturing processes and vectors can also be vastly different across cell products, we also engineered a vector where the D-Domain was replaced by an scFv targeting BCMA while leaving all other conditions identical to isolate the effects on transduction from using a D-Domain as compared to scFv. As shown in the right panel of the figure below, our anito-cel transduced T-cells demonstrated superior transduction efficiency when compared to scFv transduced T-cells derived from multiple normal human donors.

12

•
High Cell Surface Expression
:
 Coincident with higher transduction rates, the expression of the CAR on the surface of the T cell is higher with CARs employing a D-Domain compared with an scFv. As shown in the figure below, when transduced with different CAR constructs, the CAR expression on the surface of T-cells of six normal human donors was uniformly higher using a BCMA-binding D-Domain as compared to a BCMA-binding scFv. We believe that higher CAR cell surface density may help drive activation against low antigen-expressing target cells. 

CAR Surface Expression on T Cell

•
Low Tonic Signaling
:
 Tonic signaling occurs in CAR-T-cells when the CAR construct signals without engaging an antigen on a target cell, which can exhaust a T cell prematurely. T cell exhaustion has been associated with suboptimal outcomes for CAR-T therapies. Tonic signaling has been described in the literature for several scFv-based CARs. To determine the percentage of D-Domains that induce tonic signaling, we examined 42 D-Domains isolated from two different screening campaigns for their ability to signal without antigen stimulation when incorporated into a CAR construct. Pooled data indicated that only 3 out of the 42 D-Domains exhibited a level of tonic signaling above background, as measured by relative luciferase units, a signal detecting CAR activation, as represented by the blue dots in the left-hand column of the figure below. In contrast, the 42 D-Domains exhibited a much higher level of CAR activation in the presence of the CAR antigen, as illustrated by the right hand column of the figure below. We believe the low propensity for tonic signaling of D-Domain-based CARs may lower T cell exhaustion.

•
Engineered D-Domain Scaffolds
: 
The structural features of the D-Domain make it particularly well suited as a scaffold protein that can be modified by inserting selected amino acids to generate diverse libraries of proprietary target-binding domains. We create highly diverse libraries of variants of α-3D by randomly replacing 12-14 amino acid residues on the outward facing surface of α-3D with one of 18 amino acids. 

We screen the resulting libraries for potential target-binding domains and engineer further variants with the appropriate target binding profiles to enhance target specificity, optimize binding affinity, and remove potentially immunogenic sequences, a process we refer to as “deimmunization”. We use rigorous target selection criteria applied to genomic and proteomic datasets generated from public, collaborator, and internal sources. We internally validate expression profiles for all antigens under evaluation to select the best targets. At the same time, all the reagents needed to screen our proprietary D-Domain libraries for specific binders to the antigen are generated and qualified. D-Domain binders to a variety of tumor antigens have already been generated to date. We have also identified and characterized several target-binding domains for certain therapeutic targets, such as BCMA, CD123, CS1, HER2, and PD-L1, among others. AI-based approaches are employed to assist in optimization and continue to be developed to enhance our discovery process. Applying all these discovery methods, the engineered D-Domains are incorporated into our genetically modified T-cells in our ddCAR and ARC-SparX platform.

14

ARC-SparX Platform

Our ARC-SparX platform is a controllable and adaptable modular therapy that builds on our ddCARs platform by replacing the antigen binding domain of the T cell with a novel synthetic binding domain that recognizes only SparX proteins, which contain the antigen binding domain. When the SparX protein’s antigen binding domain recognizes and binds to the antigen on a diseased cell, it recruits the ARC-T cell to kill the diseased cell.

Our ARC-T-cells are designed to remain in an inactive state, or silenced, and activate only when combined with a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell. We believe that controlling ARC-T activation with SparX protein effectively separates the antigen-recognition and killing functions. By separating these functions, our approach renders the killing function of the ARC-T cell dependent on the antigen specificity and dose of the SparX protein enabling a differentiated CAR-T expansion and proliferation profile as compared to conventional CAR-T therapy. The separation of the CAR-T from the antigen binding domain allows for a more controlled, modular approach to CAR-T therapy, as SparX dosing can be modified over the course of treatment, multiple SparX proteins may be incorporated, and additional functionality (i.e., logic-gating) may be designed to expand the utility of CAR-T therapy. Further, the approach may simplify the manufacturing of multiple CAR-T programs and the regulatory path, as the ARC-T programs can utilize the same vector to express binding domain. We also believe unregulated killing, which induces severe toxicities, may be mitigated with our approach by adjusting the dose and schedule of SparX protein administration, which may expand the antigens that can be targeted safely with CAR-T therapy. Additionally, stopping the dose of the SparX protein periodically can allow the ARC-T-cells to rest after activation lowering the risk of T-cell exhaustion, which is a common cause of rapid decline of genetically modified T-cells.

Soluble Protein Antigen Receptor X-linkers (SparX protein)

All SparX proteins are comprised of one or more antigen-specific binding domains from our D-Domain library, fused to a protein that we refer to as the “TAG”. We believe the TAG we use in our SparX proteins offers unique properties that confer a competitive advantage for our program. The TAG is a protein designed to be recognized by our ARC-T-cells, which have a D-Domain-based binding moiety that is specific to the TAG, which we call the anti-TAG. This TAG/anti-TAG design is critical to the universality of our ARC-T-cells as it allows such cells to bind any SparX protein, because each SparX protein contains the same TAG. As SparX proteins bind their target antigen on diseased cells, they display the TAG thereby “tagging” such cell as one that should be killed by an ARC-T cell.

The TAG we have built into our SparX proteins is a ~26 kDa C-terminal fragment of human alpha fetoprotein (hAFP). We selected and engineered the TAG for our SparX proteins for the following reasons:

15

•
Humans have a pre-established tolerance to hAFP from experiencing high levels in utero and as pregnant mothers. We believe that creating our TAG from a normal human protein will reduce the likelihood of immunogenicity of the TAG and by extension, the SparX protein containing the TAG. 

•
We believe the small size of the SparX protein will allow it to penetrate complex tumor microenvironments with a half-life short enough (estimated to be several hours in humans) that physicians could manage an emerging toxicity by withholding or decreasing the next SparX protein dose thereby causing the ARC-T-cells to deactivate. Such control is not possible with most mAb-based adapters due to their half-life of several weeks. 

•
The TAG can also be readily fused to multiple binding regions, enabling SparX proteins to be multi-valent or multi-specific. 

Because the antigen-specific binding domains on the SparX protein differ by only 12-14 amino acids on the outer faces of the scaffold, the manufacturing process for each SparX protein is substantially similar regardless of specificity. SparX proteins can be readily produced in microbial, yeast and mammalian expression systems, and development is underway on subcutaneous formulations. We also expect the pharmacokinetics of all SparX proteins to be similar and believe that we can leverage the learnings from clinical trials of one SparX protein to inform the design of later trials for other SparX proteins.

Antigen Receptor Complex (ARC)

The ARC is similar to CARs in that both are engineered chimeric transmembrane receptors, where the engagement of the extracellular antigen binding domain induces activation of the intracellular domain resulting in the T cell’s proliferative and cytolytic activity. However, in lieu of the scFv extracellular binding domain of conventional CAR-T therapies, the extracellular domain of the ARC is comprised of our proprietary binding D-Domain that is designed to exclusively bind the TAG and not hAFP or any other known proteins or antigens. Thus, the ARC-T remains in an inactive state, or silenced, in the absence of our proprietary SparX protein. The ARC signals through a similar mechanism as traditional second-generation CARs since they share the same intracellular signaling regions of 4-1BB and CD3-zeta with the only difference arising from when the T-cells are activated.

Additionally, because all ARC-T-cells are intended to express a TAG-specific binding domain rather than a cell surface antigen-specific binding domain, the manufacturing of ARC-T is more scalable than in conventional CAR-T therapies in that ARC-T’s comprise the same drug product irrespective of clinical indication or target antigen. The same lentiviral vector comprising the universal ARC and a similar T-cell transduction process can be used for every patient regardless of disease or target antigen. With conventional CAR-T therapy, different viral vectors, each with a different T-cell transduction process, need to be used to make new CAR-T-cells when physicians want to target a new antigen. This represents a potentially significant manufacturing and regulatory advantage. In the longer term, engineering an allogeneic ARC-T cell presents the opportunity for a truly universal cell therapy that could be manufactured to be an “off-the-shelf” option that physicians can use regardless of disease or target antigen. Moreover, ARC-T-cells could be redirected to kill cells expressing different antigens just by changing the SparX protein. This universal nature of the ARC-T cell could provide substantial flexibility to the physician and allow for dynamic treatments that can respond quickly to the changing profile of a disease such as cancer, unlike a conventional CAR-T therapy.

Benefits of the ARC-SparX Platform

We believe the key benefits to our ARC-SparX platform are driven by the controllable and adaptable characteristics and present an opportunity in indications where toxicities, heterogeneity, or on-target off-tumor effects represent a challenge:

Dose Regulation of SparX Protein.
 Our ARC-T-cells are activated only when combined with a SparX protein that is bound to an antigen on a cell. Our ARC-T-cells bind the SparX protein, but do not bind directly to the diseased cell. The SparX protein is designed to recognize and bind one or more specific antigens on the diseased cells and then flag such cells for destruction. Once the triple complex of ARC-T cell plus SparX protein plus antigen-expressing cell is formed, the ARC-T cell is activated to kill the antigen-expressing cell. The ARC-T cell remains in an inactive state, or silenced, in the absence of our proprietary SparX proteins. The dosability of our ARC-SparX platform potentially provides a new way for physicians to manage or prevent severe T cell-associated toxicities, while maintaining the objective to maximize efficacy.

We have conducted

preclinical studies in which we have observed the ability of SparX proteins to control the killing function of ARC-T-cells in a dose-dependent manner.

16

Adaptability of Treatment Regimen. 
Because ARC-T-cells are not antigen-specific, they can be adapted to changing disease conditions by the administration of additional SparX proteins with different target specificity. Due to tumor heterogeneity and downregulation or loss of the target antigen, relapsed or refractory disease remains a significant issue for CAR-T therapy. On our ARC-SparX platform, physicians can administer different SparX proteins to redirect the same ARC-T-cells to new antigens. This is particularly important in settings where tumors may be heterogeneous or downregulate expression of the antigen(s) targeted by the initial SparX proteins. We believe that our ARC-SparX platform can address refractory disease caused by tumor heterogeneity because the same ARC-T-cells can be redirected 
in vivo 
to target different antigens through the administration of different SparX proteins for personalized therapy tailored to the molecular profile for each patient’s disease. This will be particularly important as we move beyond B cell malignancies into indications like AML/MDS or solid tumors. We believe our 
in vivo 
preclinical studies support the ability of ARC-T-cells to kill heterogeneous tumors through sequential administration of SparX proteins with different target specificity.

Custom Logic-Gated Therapeutics to Enable Selectivity and Improve Targeting. 
The unique properties of D-Domains, and our ability to engineer them, allow us to create mono-valent, multi-valent, or multi-specific SparX to optimize antigen binding affinity and improve efficacy. Bi-specific SparX proteins can be designed as an ‘OR’ gate to target two different antigens for broader tumor cell recognition when faced with antigen heterogeneity or an ‘AND’ gate to more specifically identify diseased cells that uniquely co-express two antigens but spare healthy cells that express only one antigen. Through affinity engineering and controlled dosing, the AND-gated bispecific SparX proteins can drive greater specificity for dual-antigen expressing tumor cells over single antigen expressing normal cells to avoid the typical on-target off-tumor related toxicities observed with so many conventional CAR-T products targeting solid tumor antigens.

Streamlined Manufacturing Across All Programs. 
ARC-T-cells are genetically modified to express the same anti-TAG binding receptor to be used in every patient, regardless of disease or the target-specificity of the SparX protein. We believe this feature may enable use of the same lentiviral vector and similar cell processing, resulting in a scalable manufacturing process that is applicable to every patient across all programs. We have also established manufacturing processes for SparX proteins utilizing a cost-effective microbial-based expression system and purification process. Because each SparX protein is substantially similar regardless of specificity, the manufacturing and purification processes for each SparX protein is substantially similar regardless of specificity. For more details, see “—Manufacturing and Delivery.”

Efficient Regulatory Process. 
Because the ARC-T cell manufacturing process is identical across all ARC-SparX programs, the regulatory requirements will be shared across the platform. This may provide advantages that will span global regulatory filings from IND through post BLA requirements.

Our Pipeline Approach

We are leveraging the full breadth of our platform by matching ddCARs and ARC-SparX with the indications in which they would be most effective based on the biology, patients, and market dynamics.

In MM, we plan to:

•
Evaluate the efficacy of our lead product candidate, anito-cel, in our pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 and Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trials in rrMM and seek regulatory approval in collaboration with Kite; 

•
In collaboration with Kite, pursue expanded access to anito-cel through other label expansion clinical trials, including iMMagine-3 and others; 

•
Through our ex-U.S. partner, Kite, pursue clinical development of anito-cel in other key geographies, such as Europe and Asia; and  

•
Evaluate the potential of our ARC-SparX technology through our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of ACLX-001 in rrMM. 

In AML/MDS, we plan to:

•
Pursue AML/MDS with a library of SparX proteins beginning with our wholly-owned ACLX-002 program, which is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial; and 

•
Explore trials that evaluate the use of a single administration of ARC-T-cells together with a combination of SparX proteins engineered to target different AML and MDS antigens, to extend the power of the platform. 

17

In additional indications,  we plan to:

•
Evaluate the efficacy of anito-cel in indications outside of oncology, including in some autoimmune indications such as gMG.

•
Extend benefits of our D-Domain platform by applying ddCARs and ARC-SparXs to additional hematological and solid tumor indications, including SCLC and HCC. 

Our Pipeline

We have built a broad and scalable pipeline that has positioned us to capitalize on the potential of our proprietary platform technologies and achieve long-term growth and sustainability within the field of cell therapy. We have summarized our preclinical and clinical programs in the pipeline chart below and indicated where such programs are subject to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, which is described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below. Except for such partnered programs, we have worldwide rights to all of our programs:

* Kite exercised its option to negotiate a license for ACLX-001 and retains an option for additional select ARC-SparX programs in multiple myeloma and lymphoma

Our Multiple Myeloma Program

Our MM program is led by our anito-cel product candidate, which is an autologous cell therapy comprised of D-Domain powered T-cells that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill specific cells expressing BCMA, a target antigen for multiple myeloma. In collaboration with Kite, we are advancing our anito-cel product through our pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 trial in patients with rrMM, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and thereafter plan to pursue U.S. regulatory approval. We and Kite are also evaluating anito-cel in our global Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trial in second through fourth line patients with rrMM which began dosing patients in the fourth quarter of 2024. Anito-cel has been granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug by the FDA. In May 2021, we also received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for anito-cel for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In collaboration with Kite, we plan to continue to enroll more patients into additional clinical trials, to support label expansion to enter into earlier lines of therapy and include patients who have had prior BCMA-targeted therapies. Additionally, pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, as further described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, Kite will pursue international clinical trials to expand into geographic locations in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We are also advancing our initial ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, an immunotherapeutic combination composed of ARC-T-cells and bi-valent SparX proteins targeting BCMA, to treat rrMM. This program is designed to lay the foundation for our ARC-SparX platform. In December 2023, Kite exercised its option under the Kite Collaboration Agreement to negotiate a license for ACLX-001.

Market Opportunity

MM

is a type of hematological cancer in which diseased plasma cells proliferate and accumulate in the bone marrow, crowding out healthy blood cells and causing bone lesions, loss of bone density and bone fractures. These abnormal plasma cells also produce excessive quantities of an abnormal immunoglobulin fragment called a myeloma protein (M protein) causing kidney damage and impairing the patient’s immune function.

MM is the third most common hematological malignancy in the United States and Europe, representing approximately 10% of all hematological cancer cases, 20% of deaths due to hematological malignancies and, by our estimate, impacting over 175,000 patients globally each year. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database projects that approximately 35,000 new cases of MM in the United States and over 35,000 new cases in six select markets within Europe and Asia.

The median age of MM patients at diagnosis is 69 years with one-third of patients diagnosed at an age of at least 75 years. Because MM tends to afflict patients at an advanced stage of life, patients often have multiple co-morbidities and toxicities that can quickly escalate and become life-endangering. Despite the development and use of multiple new therapies, including second generation proteasome inhibitors (PI) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD), stem cell transplantation and CD38-binding monoclonal antibodies, the five-year survival rate is still approximately 60% and MM remains incurable in most patients.

Currently, multiple BCMA-targeting therapies are approved, in development or under regulatory review, including T cell engagers (TCEs), antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and other CAR-T therapies.

We estimate that the size of the global MM market was approximately $25 billion in 2024 and that the current total addressable CAR-T market for rrMM to be $12 billion or more based on the number of patients who are receiving second line treatments and beyond.

As of December 31, 2024, the two CAR-T therapies targeting BCMA that have been approved by the FDA are Abecma and Carvykti, developed and marketed by 2seventy bio/Bristol Myers Squibb and Legend/Johnson & Johnson, respectively. Currently, Abecma is approved for the treatment of adult patients with rrMM after two or more prior lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Carvykti is approved for the treatment of adult patients with rrMM who have received at least 1 prior line of therapy, including a PI and an IMiD and are refractory to lenalidomide. In addition to its current approval in rrMM, Carvykti is currently enrolling additional clinical trials to expand into front-line multiple myeloma treatment.

Carvykti, developed by Legend/Johnson & Johnson, has demonstrated an ORR of 97.9%, a CR/sCR rate of 82% and an estimated median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 34.9 months in the Phase 1b/2 CARTITUDE-1 trial in patients with rrMM that had received 3 or more prior lines of therapy. Abecma developed by 2seventy bio/Bristol Myers Squibb, has demonstrated an ORR of 73.4%, and an sCR/CR rate of 33% with an estimated mPFS of 8.8 months in the Phase 2 KarMMa trial in patients with rrMM that had received 3 or more prior lines of therapy.

Although approved BCMA-targeting CAR-T therapies represent a step forward, there remains a need for improved overall response, durability, safety, and accessibility, especially in difficult to treat patient populations. For example, across the clinical trials of Abecma and Carvykti, several poor prognostic factors have been identified including the presence of extra-medullary disease (EMD) and more broadly plasmacytomas, ISS stage 3, high tumor burden, and high-risk cytogenetics. In clinical trials in rrMM, these patients demonstrated shorter PFS rates. For example, in the Phase 1b/2 trial of Carvykti (CARTITUDE-1), patients with plasmacytomas (of which ~2/3 had EMD) demonstrated a mPFS of 13.8 months, patients with ISS stage 3 disease demonstrated a mPFS of 15.0 months, patients with BMPC ≥60% demonstrated a mPFS of 24.1 months, and patients with high risk cytogenetics demonstrated a mPFS of 21.1 months. Additionally, Carvykti has a Black Box warning for Parkinsonism and Guillain-Barré syndrome, and its label contains Warnings and Precautions for Neurologic Toxicities, including those not considered ICANS such as  Parkinsonism, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Immune Mediated Myelitis, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Cranial Nerve Palsies.

In addition to the FDA-approved CAR-T therapies targeting BCMA, several other BCMA-targeting therapies have been approved by the FDA for treatment of rrMM, these include BCMA-targeting TCEs and ADCs.

•
In October 2022, the BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody, Tecvayli developed by Johnson & Johnson, received accelerated approval for treatment of adults with rrMM who have received at least four prior lines of therapy. Tecvayli has reported an ORR of 63% and a CR/sCR rate of 46%, with a mPFS of 11.4 months. However, Tecvayli is dosed weekly or biweekly, and is administered under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program and requires hospitalization through the initial titration period. 

19

•
In August 2023, the BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody, Elrexfio, developed by Pfizer, received accelerated approval for treatment of adults with rrMM who have received at least four prior lines of therapy. Elrexfio has reported an ORR of 61% and a CR/sCR rate of 37%, with a mPFS of 17.2 months. However, Elrexfio is dosed weekly or biweekly, and is administered under a REMS, and requires hospitalization following administration of the initial doses. 

•
The BCMA-targeting ADC, Blenrep was an approved product, but the manufacturer, GSK, began the withdrawal of the U.S. marketing authorization in November 2022, at the request of the FDA. In November 2023, GSK announced positive results from the Phase 3 DREAMM-7 trial of Blenrep in rrMM, which were presented in February 2024. DREAMM-7 evaluated belantamab mafodotin (belamaf) + bortezomib, and dexamethasone (BVd) vs daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVd) in rrMM patients with at least one line of prior therapy and reported an ORR of 83%, CR/sCR of 34% and mPFS of 37 months which was deemed as a clinically meaningful improvement over comparator arm. GSK is also evaluating the Phase 3 DREAMM-8 trial of Blenrep in rrMM. DREAMM-8 is a randomized, open-label trial that evaluated belantamab mafodotin, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (BPd), as compared with pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd), in lenalidomide-exposed rrMM patients after at least one line of therapy. BPd reported an ORR of 77% and CR/sCR of 40%. mPFS was not reached for the BPd cohort after a median follow-up of 22 months. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of July 23, 2025 for both BVd and BPd combinations.

anito-cel: Phase 1 Trial in rrMM

The anito-cel Phase 1 multi-center, open label, trial is the first involving one of our proprietary D-Domains and was designed to test anito-cel in rrMM patients to evaluate the safety profile of escalating dose levels (DL) and to expand enrollment at a selected dose to further characterize the efficacy and safety profile of that dose. To be eligible, patients must have had at least 3 prior lines of treatment, which had to include an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), a proteosome inhibitor (PI), and an anti-CD38 antibody, be refractory to the most recent line of therapy, have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, have measurable disease, and have adequate function of vital organs. If eligible, patients were enrolled, underwent leukapheresis (apheresis), and could receive bridging therapy while cell manufacturing occurred. When anito-cel cell manufacturing was complete, patients received lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy with fludarabine (Flu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) on days -5, -4, and -3. On day 0, patients received an intravenous infusion of anito-cel. After infusion, patients were evaluated at fixed intervals for assessment of AEs and evidence of objective response using PET/CT scan, serum measurement of M-protein (including heavy or light chain measurement), and measurement of number of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. Safety data are assessed for dose limiting toxicity in the first 28 days following infusion and will be collected throughout the trial. Long-term safety data will be collected for up to 15 years per health authority guidelines. Efficacy data are assessed pursuant to the IMWG criteria on a monthly basis for the first 6 months and then quarterly for up to two years, or upon symptomatic relapse.

The IMWG uniform response criteria have been utilized in registration trials of approved myeloma drugs. The IMWG uniform response criteria assess efficacy of treatment options for myeloma and allow for a comparison of efficacy between treatment strategies in clinical trials, strict definitions for responses, as shown in the table below, and classifications to improve detail and clarify inconsistent interpretations across clinical trials. The IMWG criteria for sCR, CR, VGPR, and PR are summarized below.

•
stringent Complete Response (sCR)
: Complete Response (as defined below) plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow biopsy by immunohistochemistry (kappa to lambda light chain ratio (
k
/
l
) ≤4:1 or ≥1:2 for 
k
 or 
l 
patients, respectively, after counting ≥100 plasma cells). 

20

•
Complete Response (CR)
: Negative immunofixation in the serum and urine; and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas; and <5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. 

•
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)
: Serum and urine M protein, detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis; or ≥90% reduction in serum M protein plus urine M protein level <100 mg/24 hr. 

•
Partial Response (PR)
: ≥50% reduction of serum M protein plus reduction in 24-hour urinary M protein by ≥90% or to <200 mg/24 h; or if the serum and urine M protein are unmeasurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M protein criteria and if serum-free light assay is also unmeasurable, ≥50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M protein, provided baseline BMPC percentage was ≥30%. In addition to these criteria, if present at baseline, a ≥50% reduction in the size (SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required. 

Overall Response Rate (ORR) includes patients that achieved sCR, CR, VGPR or PR. sCR and CR do not indicate that the patient was cured of the condition, as multiple myeloma is currently considered incurable.

The clinical trial began enrollment in December 2019 and the first patient was dosed in February 2020. Four clinical trial sites participated in the Phase 1 trial. We completed the dose escalation component with 6 patients each enrolled in DL1 (100 (+/-20%) x 10
6
 cells) and DL2 (300 (+/- 20%) x 10

cells) and enrolled additional patients (n=26) at DL1 for further characterization of safety and preliminary efficacy. The median dose administered in DL1 was 115 million cells (range, 112-120 million cells), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is 115 (+/- 10) x 10
6
 CAR+ cells. The data from the dose escalation and expansion were most recently presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the ASH. In the safety and efficacy analysis, 38 patients were evaluable, 32 in the DL1 and 6 in DL2.

Patient and Disease Characteristics are demonstrated in the table below. Taken together, these demographic data indicate the patient population enrolled in this trial had poor prognosis with expected median OS in the range of 6-8 months based on published analyses of patients with similar characteristics.

As of the October 3, 2024 data cutoff date, the ORR was 100%, the CR/sCR rate was 79%, the VGPR rate was 13%, and the PR rate was 8%. As previously presented (ASH Presentation 2022), the likelihood of achieving CR/sCR increased with longer follow-up. This observation is consistent with other rrMM studies, especially in BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell trials, primarily related to the IMWG criteria for CR/sCR. Additionally, 89% (n=25 of 28) of all subjects who are evaluable for minimal residual disease testing (MRD) were negative at the depth of 10
-5
. Evaluable patients had identifiable malignant clone in the baseline bone marrow aspirate.

As of the October 3, 2024 data cutoff date, with a median follow up of 38.1 months, the mPFS for all patients (N=38) was 30.2 months. For those subjects with CR/sCR (n=30), the mPFS was 34.3 months. Median OS was Not Reached.

22

A Kaplan-Meier analysis of all subjects demonstrated a PFS rate at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months of 92%, 76%, 65%, 57%, and 50%, respectively. A subgroup analysis of subjects with high risk clinical features (defined as presence of EMD, BMPC ≥ 60%, High Risk Cytogenetics or ISS Stage III) indicated similar PFS rates at 12, 24, and 30 months of 72%, 60%, and 60%, respectively.

23

Of the 38 patients dosed in our Phase 1 trial of anito-cel, all (100%) were evaluable for safety analysis. No delayed or non-ICANS neurotoxicities were observed, including no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome in the entire population through the follow-up period. The rate of AEs of grade 3 or higher CRS and ICANS are of special interest (AESIs). A potential difference was observed in the incidence of AESIs in DL2 compared with DL1. Specifically, in DL2 (n=6), 1 patient had a grade 3 CRS event and another had a grade 3 ICANS event, while no events of grade 3 or higher CRS or ICANS occurred in the 6-patient dose escalation cohort of DL1. After dose expansion at the RP2D, no events of grade 3 or higher CRS were observed in a total of 32 subjects. and only 1 (3%) out of 32 patients had a grade 3 ICANS event. In combined analysis of all patients in DL1, 30 (94%) had a grade 1 or 2 CRS event but 0% had grade 3 or higher CRS.  The median time to onset of CRS was 2 (range 1-12) days and median duration was 8 (range 2-14) days. The median time to ICANS onset was 4.5 days (range 3-6 days) with a median duration of 7.5 days (4-11 days). All cases of ICANS and CRS resolved with standard interventions, such as tocilizumab and dexamethasone. Additional AEs, regardless of attribution, were presented at the ASH 2024 Annual Meeting and are presented in the figures below. The observed AEs are consistent with those of other autologous CAR-T-cells in clinical trials and in commercial use.

anito-cel: Phase 2 Pivotal Trial in rrMM (iMMagine-1)

Our Phase 2 pivotal trial of anito-cel in rrMM, the iMMagine-1 trial is a single-arm, open-label, evaluation of the efficacy of anito-cel, as measured by the primary endpoint of ORR. Key secondary endpoints include sCR/CR rate and duration of response of a single infusion of anito-cel after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was selected based on historical precedent of the primary endpoint used in other CAR-T pivotal trials and the selection of this primary endpoint has been reviewed and agreed with the FDA. Based upon feedback from regulatory authorities, we plan to include the 117 patients in the pivotal iMMagine-1 trial as the primary analysis used for review for consideration of approval. To be eligible, patients must have had at least 3 prior lines of treatment, which had to include an IMiD, PI and an anti-CD38 antibody, be refractory to the most recent line of therapy, have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, have measurable disease, and have adequate function of vital organs. This trial is being conducted at institutions in the United States only. Other secondary and/or exploratory endpoints will include progression free survival (PFS), OS, assessment of minimal residual disease, further characterization of the safety profile of anito-cel in a larger patient population, and confirmatory correlative biomarker analysis for pharmacology, predictive biomarkers of depth and duration of response, and manufactured anito-cel cell phenotyping. Based on continued positive data from this clinical trial, we plan to file a BLA in collaboration with Kite.

The iMMagine-1 trial was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and completed dosing patient in the fourth quarter of 2024. Twenty clinical trial sites participated in the iMMagine-1 trial. Patients (N=117) were administered a single infusion of anito-cel at a dose level of 115 million cells 115 (+/- 10) x 10
6
 viable CAR+ cells. The preliminary data from iMMagine-1 were presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the ASH. As of the October 31, 2024 data cutoff date used for the ASH presentation, 86 patients were evaluable for efficacy based on a follow-up of at least two months after treatment with anito-cel, and 98 patients were evaluable for safety based on a follow-up of at least one month after treatment with anito-cel.

25

In the safety evaluable population, 85 of 98 patients (87%) were triple refractory, and 41 of 98 patients (42%) were penta refractory. Patients received a median of four prior lines of therapy, with 45 of 98 patients (46%) having received three prior lines. Patient and Disease Characteristics are demonstrated in the table below.

As of the October 31, 2024 data cutoff date, 86 patients were evaluable for efficacy based on a follow-up of at least two months after treatment with anito-cel. With a median follow up of 9.5 months, ORR was 97%, the CR/sCR rate was 62%, the VGPR rate was 20%, and the PR rate was 15%. Data were investigator assessed per IMWG criteria, for more information see the section entitled “Our Multiple Myeloma Program - anito-cel: Phase 1 Trial in rrMM” above. Additionally, 93% (n=54 of 58) of all subjects who are evaluable for minimal residual disease testing (MRD) were negative at the depth of 10
-5
. MRD evaluable patients had identifiable malignant clone in the baseline bone marrow aspirate and had a post-treatment bone marrow sample sufficient to assess MRD negativity.

26

With a median follow-up of 9.5 months, PFS and OS were not reached at the time of the October 31, 2024 data cutoff date, as less than half of all dosed subjects had experienced an event of progression or death. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of efficacy evaluable subjects demonstrated a PFS rate, which reflect the percentage of patients who are alive and have not progressed, at 6 and 12 of 93% and 79%,  respectively. Additionally, OS rates by Kaplan-Meier analysis, at 6 and 12 months were 97% and 97%, respectively.

For the 98 patient in the safety evaluable population, anito-cel demonstrated a predictable manageable safety profile. No delayed or non-ICANS neurotoxicities were reported, including no Parkinsonism, no cranial nerve palsies, and no Guillain-Barré syndrome. 84 of 98 patients (86%) experienced Grade 1 or lower cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including 17 (17%) with no CRS. The median time to onset of CRS was 4 days with a median duration of 3 days. 98% of patients had CRS that either resolved within 14 days of anito-cel infusion or did not experience any CRS. Any grade ICANS was observed in 9 patients (9%) with 4 (4%) Grade 1, 4 (4%) Grade 2, and 1 (1%) Grade 3. All cases of ICANS resolved. Three deaths occurred in the 117 patients treated in iMMagine-1 due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (related or unrelated to anito-cel: retroperitoneal hemorrhage, CRS, and fungal infection). Cytopenias were the most common Grade ≥3 TEAEs; 53 patients (54%) had Grade ≥3 neutropenia, 20 (20%) had Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, and 22 (22%) had Grade ≥3 anemia.

27

anito-cel: Global Phase 3 Trial (iMMagine-3)

Pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, as further described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, Kite initiated iMMagine-3, a global Phase 3 randomized controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of anito-cel with standard of care in patients with rrMM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory drug (lMiD) and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.

iMMagine-3 will enroll approximately 450 adult patients. Prior to randomization, an investigator’s choice of standard of care (SOC) regimen will be selected, which include either: pomalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (PVd); daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd); carfilzomib, daratumumab, and dexamethasone (KDd); or carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd). Patients in the anito-cel arm will undergo leukapheresis and bridging therapy (with the SOC regimen selected by the investigator prior to randomization) followed by lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and one infusion of anito-cel (115×10
6
 CAR+ T cells) on Day 1. Patients in the control arm will continue to receive the selected SOC regimen.

The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent review according to the IMWG uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma (MM) with the hypothesis that anito-cel will prolong PFS compared to SOC. Key secondary endpoints include complete response rate (CR/sCR), minimal residual disease negativity, OS, and safety.

The iMMagine-3 study was initiated in the second half of 2024 and is planned to enroll across approximately 130 study sites in North America, Europe, and the rest of the world.

28

anito-cel: Future Clinical Plans

Pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, as further described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, Kite will initiate clinical trials of anito-cel in additional key geographies, such as Europe and Asia, which may also serve to further expand the label into additional myeloma or lymphoma populations in the United States.

ACLX-001 (BCMA): Phase 1 Trial

Our first ARC-SparX program is ACLX-001, an immunotherapeutic combination composed of ARC-T-cells and bi-valent SparX proteins targeting BCMA, or SPRX001, for the treatment of rrMM. In ACLX-001, we use our ARC-T-cells for the first time in combination with SPRX001, which utilizes the same antigen binding domain as anito-cel. We initiated our Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial of ACLX-001 in the second quarter of 2022. This trial is intended to serve as clinical validation of our ARC-SparX platform as we seek to understand PK, safety profile, and dosing strategy for future clinical development. The clinical trial is designed to allow dose escalation and flexibility in the frequency of SPRX001 administration based on observed pharmacokinetics of SPRX001 and ARC-T cell expansion kinetics.

The primary objective of the trial is to provide clinical validation of our ARC-SparX platform as we seek to understand PK, safety profile, and dosing strategy for future clinical development programs. We intend to also demonstrate clinical benefit in patients with rrMM that can support the potential of ACLX-001 and the ARC-SparX platform. The primary endpoint of the trial is to determine the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Upon completion of the Phase 1 trial, we will leverage the learnings from this trial to advance our AML/MDS programs utilizing ARC-SparX and consider developing additional SparX for rrMM for a broader pipeline in this disease area. Additionally, in December 2023, Kite exercised its option under the Kite Collaboration Agreement to negotiate a license for ACLX-001. Upon successful negotiation of such license, we will collaborate with Kite on the further development of ACLX-001.

Our AML/MDS Programs

With the ARC-SparX platform we are developing a comprehensive solution for personalized therapy tailored to the molecular profile of an AML/MDS patient’s disease.

29

Diseased cells from AML and high risk MDS patients often have a complex cytogenetic profile that leads to significant clonal heterogeneity. This heterogeneity exists not only between patients but also within an individual’s disease. Traditional targeted therapies including CAR-Ts have struggled to drive deep and durable responses because they target only a fraction of the patient’s diseased cells. In addition, traditional CAR-T targets in AML/MDS such as CD33, CD123 and CLL1 are expressed on normal myeloid cells, including progenitor cell populations, which may lead to prolonged myelosuppression.

We intend to utilize SparX proteins targeting different AML and MDS antigens that can be used in combination to combat disease heterogeneity. Furthermore, we believe the controllability of the ARC-SparX platform will give physicians the ability to turn off the therapy once disease is controlled to allow for faster recovery of the normal myeloid compartment and thus less toxicity. We initiated the Phase 1 clinical trial for ACLX-002, our lead ARC-SparX program for AML/MDS in the fourth quarter of 2022 and continue to develop preclinical SparX proteins for other AML/MDS antigens.

Background, Current Treatments and Limitations

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
, also referred to as acute myelogenous leukemia, arises from healthy bone marrow stem cells that have accumulated multiple genetic mutations causing the mutated stem cells to grow uncontrollably. The aggressive growth of AML cells in the bone marrow disrupts the development of healthy blood cells including white cells, red cells and platelets. The net result is that AML patients often present with anemia (too few red blood cells), infections (caused by too few functioning white blood cells) or frequent bleeding and bruising (caused by too few platelets). The aggressive growth of AML in the bone marrow and blood, its disruption of normal blood cell production and the lack of durable treatments leave AML patients with an estimated 35% five-year survival rate.

According to the National Cancer Institute SEER database, there were estimated to be 73,168 people living with AML in the USA in 2020. New cases were estimated to have been approximately 19,940, with 11,180 deaths in 2020. The disease accounts for approximately 1.1% of all new cancers, but is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults. AML also represents approximately 20% of childhood leukemia.

The standard of care for the majority of AML patients consists of induction chemotherapy (cytarabine and anthracycline) followed by additional rounds of chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplant. Although approximately two-thirds of patients achieve remission, relapse often occurs within the first 18 months following treatment. The high relapse rate points to the need for new therapies capable of extending disease free survival. We believe there is a critical need to develop new therapeutic modalities with greater safety and efficacy, especially for patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

Currently, new therapies for AML have many limitations. The lead candidates of small molecule inhibitors of proteins that are over-expressed or otherwise dysregulated in AML show only modest efficacy with short duration of response. Antibody-based therapeutics, including antibody-drug conjugates and bispecifics, have thus far shown limited efficacy and in some cases, significant toxicities. Additionally, cell therapies are being deployed with specificity for various targets including CD33, CD123, FLT3, CLL1, CD19, IL1RAP and NKG2DL. Many of these therapies are in the early stages of clinical development. The common theme across the various therapeutic modalities described above is the need for new therapies with enhanced efficacy and improved safety.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
is a closely related disease in which a population of abnormal myeloid stem cells develop in the bone marrow. Depending on the type of abnormal, or dysplastic cell that emerges, patients may experience a specific decrease in red blood cells, or one of the disease-fighting cell populations referred to as monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. Like AML, MDS impacts the elderly with patients often diagnosed in their 70s. The incidence of MDS has been estimated to be as low as 10,000 new cases per year in the United States. MDS is considered to be a type of cancer because about one-third of MDS patients progress to AML. Standard therapy for MDS is cytarabine alone or in combination with idarubicin or daunorubicin. Stem cell transplant can cure MDS but the advanced age of onset and co-morbidities often limit MDS patient transplant eligibility due to the toxicity of typical transplant conditioning regimens, especially for those patients characterized with high risk MDS. Thus, new therapies are needed for MDS patients as well.

30

ACLX-002 (CD123): Phase 1 Trial

Our first AML/MDS product candidate is ACLX-002, which is an immunotherapeutic combination agent composed of the same ARC-T-cells used in ACLX-001, together with mono-valent SparX proteins that each contain a binding domain directed at CD123. We began clinical development of ACLX-002 in the fourth quarter of 2022 with initiation of a Phase 1, dose escalation trial of both ARC-T-cells and SPRX002 in relapsed or refractory AML and/or high-risk MDS. The primary objective of the trial is to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) that does not exceed the MTD and achieves evidence of clear clinical benefit. The primary endpoint of the trial will be to determine the incidence of TEAEs, including DLTs. The clinical trial is designed to allow dose escalation and flexibility in the frequency of SPRX002 administration based on observed pharmacokinetics of SPRX002 and ARC-T cell expansion kinetics.

Preclinical AML/MDS Product Candidates

We have also identified a group of high priority antigen targets associated with AML/MDS through internal analyses and conversations with key opinion leaders and are developing additional SparX proteins against such target antigens. We have isolated D-Domain binders to several of these high value AML/MDS targets and plan to progress them in our pipeline. In several of our preclinical and discovery projects, we have engineered D-Domains into SparX proteins that bind to these targets, including for ACLX-003, which continues to progress towards IND filing. Additionally, we are building a map of target expression in primary AML patient tumors to understand how our targets may eventually be combined to combat the inherent heterogeneity of the disease.

Our Autoimmune Program

We intend to evaluate the efficacy of anito-cel outside of our collaboration with Kite in indications outside of oncology, which remain wholly-owned, including in some autoimmune indications. Initially, we are focusing our efforts on anito-cel in settings where elimination of plasma cells may be relevant for patients with severe autoimmune diseases. For example, published scientific studies have shown that clearance of plasma cells within patients that have antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases have resulted in improvement in clinical symptoms. In the future, we may develop additional assets and technology to expand on the opportunity for D-Domain based therapies in autoimmune diseases.

We recently initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of anito-cel in generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by severe muscle weakness. In gMG, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks proteins in the neuromuscular junction, disrupting neuromuscular signaling and preventing muscle contraction. We believe anito-cel's mechanism in targeting plasma cells through BCMA may be a relevant mechanism to address the underlying pathogenesis of disease. We estimate that gMG affects over 70,000 people in the United States and there is no known cure.

Our Solid Tumor Program

We intend to develop multiple assets and novel technology to combat a variety of solid tumor indications while leveraging the strengths of each of our existing therapeutic platforms.

ddCARs may be best suited for targets that have highly homogeneous tumor cell expression with little to no normal cell expression with potential for a wide therapeutic window. We are continuing to build ddCARs where the target biology supports this approach. To this end, we have selected D-Domain binders to an attractive target that we are evaluating as a ddCAR to potentially treat patients with HCC.

Some solid tumors have been shown to contain a high level of heterogeneity within an individual’s tumor. Where this heterogeneity exists, we believe a library of SparX proteins targeting a specific solid tumor patient population has the potential to drive deep and durable responses beyond those produced by any single targeting therapeutic. We currently have engineered novel SparX proteins for various solid tumor-associated antigens, some with overlapping expression in specific patient populations such as SCLC, that together may allow ARC-SparX product candidates to overcome antigen heterogeneity of the disease.

Targeting solid tumors with cellular therapy presents additional hurdles such as on-target off-tumor toxicity as well as physical and immunological barriers. We intend to use a multi-pronged approach employing innovative technological solutions such as AND-gated SparX proteins as well as technologies designed to enhance the persistence and function of ddCAR or ARC-T-cells in the tumor environment. We also intend to employ clinical and translational strategies such as combinations with checkpoint inhibitors to boost activity of ddCAR or ARC-T-cells to further overcome some common immunological barriers to successful CAR-T therapy.

31

Additional Indications and Applications of Our Technology

We believe our platform technologies lend themselves to a broad array of potential applications, including:

Novel Targets
. 
We believe our platforms are well suited to safely and rapidly explore targeting of novel antigens that would be otherwise challenging to target with a conventional CAR-Ts. We have successfully generated D-Domain binders to many tumor antigens and are employing sophisticated tools, such as AI and ML, to optimize these assets. We employ AI-based approaches to assist in the optimization of D-Domain properties and continue to develop AI-based approaches to enhance our discovery process. We currently use an in-silico immunogenicity risk assessment and deimmunization platform using an ML algorithm for predicting potential immunogenic epitopes. We also use AI-based protein structure determination programs to analyze the surface chemistry of our D-Domains to better determine aspects such as library design and hit optimization. We believe further implementation of AI and  ML can assist in other areas of the discovery process such as D-Domain affinity optimization from deep learning of analysis of thousands of D-Domain sequences from our panning and screening campaigns.

Next-Generation Cell Therapy Products, such as Allogeneic and Other Immune Cell Therapies
. 
We believe it may be important for patients to have both autologous and allogeneic/off-the-shelf cell therapy options in certain settings as both therapeutic options mature, including therapies derived from T-cells and NK cells. Under the Kite Collaboration Agreement, as further described in “Licenses and Collaborations” below, Kite will develop allogeneic/off-the-shelf cell therapies for the treatment of myeloma  as another tool in our fight against cancer that includes our autologous ddCARs and ARC-SparX.

Indications Beyond Oncology
. 
As the field of adoptive cell therapy looks to apply the technology beyond oncology, including transplantation, autoimmune, cardiac, infectious and neurological diseases, so too do we seek to explore such opportunities. We envision expanding into treatments for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. For example, published scientific studies have shown that clearance of plasma cells within patients that have antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases have resulted in improvement in clinical symptoms. We may evaluate anito-cel or ACLX-001 in settings where elimination of plasma cells may be relevant for patients with severe autoimmune diseases and have advanced anito-cel into a Phase 1 trial in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).

Diagnostics. 
Our D-Domains or SparX proteins may be used in various diagnostic settings much like monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments. As an example, we can envision labeling SparX proteins with a radiotracer for imaging tumors in patients as a patient selection tool prior to starting therapy with that same SparX together with ARC-T-cells.

Antibody Alternatives. 
Our binding domains have many positive attributes over scFv binding domains that we believe could allow them to be used as an scFv alternative in non-cell therapy applications and serve as the foundation to creating a new class of therapeutic antibody alternatives.

Manufacturing and Delivery

Our manufacturing process is consistent across anito-cel cells and ARC-T-cells. This consistent process enables flexibility of cell product production within a site using the same equipment and consistent protocols, utilizing product specific viral vector input. In our iMMagine-1 trial, anito-cel was successfully manufactured for 99% of patients enrolled. In May 2024, we announced the completion of technical transfer of our cell manufacturing process to Kite, which was initiated in 2023, and Kite is responsible pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement for manufacturing activities for future clinical trials, including the ongoing iMMagine-3 trial, and for commercial supply of anito-cel.

anito-cel Cell and ARC-T Cell

We currently rely on third parties for the manufacture and release testing of viral vectors and product candidates for clinical testing. We also currently rely on third parties for patient apheresis material logistics, as well as to package, label, store and distribute our product candidates. As we progress through development to commercialization, we will leverage our best-in-class vendors and collaboration with Kite, and evaluate other options as needed, to secure commercial-scale capacity.

In 2024, we completed the technology transfer activities and submitted IND amendments for the manufacturing of anito-cel at Kite for the manufacturing of our cell product. As we scale within our clinical trials and prepare for commercialization, we plan to increase capacity with our current suppliers and expand through our collaboration with Kite. Per the Kite Collaboration Agreement, Kite will manufacture anito-cel and Kite will bear the CMC commercial readiness costs and associated capital expenses. The parties will continue to split manufacturing costs for clinical material. Through our Kite Collaboration Agreement, we continue to invest in process improvements to reduce the overall process time and improve costs. Our D-Domain, due to its stability, has demonstrated a high transduction rate resulting in a more efficient manufacturing process. We believe this will translate to improved processes that will reduce the time to intervention for patients.

32

We have established partnerships with experienced cell therapy contract manufacturers to supply clinical materials and manufacturing services for our clinical trials outside of the Kite Collaboration Agreement. As we scale within our clinical trials and prepare for commercialization, we plan to increase capacity with our current suppliers and expand through our collaboration with Kite. Per the Kite Collaboration Agreement, Kite will manufacture anito-cel following completion of the technical transfer of our manufacturing process to Kite, which was completed in 2024, and Kite will bear the CMC commercial readiness costs and associated capital expenses.  The parties will continue to split manufacturing costs for clinical material. The manufacturing process for our ARC-T-cells is consistent with the anito-cel process. However, cells are transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding our universal ARC, which is a CAR with an anti-TAG binding domain, in lieu of a lentiviral vector encoding the CAR construct with an anti-BCMA binding domain. Because our ARC-T-cells are designed to express the same TAG-specific binding domain rather than a cell surface antigen-specific binding domain, the same lentiviral vector encoding the universal ARC can be used across ARC-SparX programs regardless of disease or target antigen.

SparX Protein

We manufacture SparX proteins in-house for most research activities, but we use a third-party CMO for most preclinical studies, and all clinical trials. We produce research SparX proteins in mammalian and microbial systems using fermentation and protein purification strategies that we believe can be scaled for commercial purposes. The purified SparX protein is formulated to the desired concentration and then put into the desired formulation buffer. Every SparX protein is monitored throughout the purification process and afterwards using an array of analytical tests that assess SparX protein size, binding activity and potential biophysical changes in the SparX protein. We anticipate the process will evolve over time to improve yields, quality and quantity of recovered SparX protein.

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the oncology subsector, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. Any candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies as well as therapies that may be developed in the future. While we believe our D-Domain, ddCAR and ARC-SparX platforms and scientific expertise provide us with a number of key advantages, we face substantial competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.

We anticipate substantial direct competition from other organizations developing advanced CAR-Ts, other types of genetically modified cell therapies, or other anti-BCMA biologics due to their promising clinical therapeutic effect in clinical trials including: 2seventy bio, Abbvie, Allogene, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Autolus, Bristol Myers Squibb, CARSgen, Cartesian, Cellular Biomedicine Group, Gilead, Gracell, GSK, Immix, Innovent, Johnson & Johnson, Legend, Novartis, Nanjing IASO Biotherapeutics Ltd, Pfizer, Poseida Therapeutics, Precision BioSciences, Pregene, Regeneron and Roche. In addition, some companies, such as Allogene, Caribou Biosciences, Cellectis, Celyad, and Crispr, are developing allogeneic cell therapies that could compete with our product candidate.

We cannot predict whether other types of therapies including CAR-T or other genetically modified cell therapies may be developed and demonstrate greater efficacy, and we may have direct and substantial competition from such therapies in the future. Further, despite the novel approach that we have developed to address the limitations of CAR-T and other types of genetically modified cell therapies, we expect to face increasing competition as new, more effective treatments for cancer enter the market and further advancements in technologies are made. We expect market adoption of any treatments that we develop and commercialize to be dependent on, among other things, efficacy, safety, delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, gene therapy and cell therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our product candidates.

33

Commercialization

In light of our current stage of development, we are in the early phases of establishing a commercial organization and distribution capabilities. Prior to approval of any of our product candidates, we intend to establish a commercialization infrastructure for those products. Additionally, pursuant to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, we and Kite will be jointly responsible for commercialization of anito-cel and certain other MM cell therapy products, if approved by the FDA, in the United States and plan to leverage Kite’s commercialization infrastructure, including sales and marketing and commercial distribution. Kite will be responsible for commercialization of anito-cel and such other MM products outside the United States, to the extent they are approved by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Licenses and Collaborations

Collaboration and License Agreement with Kite Pharma, Inc.

In December 2022, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the Kite Collaboration Agreement) with Kite Pharma, Inc., a Gilead company (Kite), to co-develop and co-commercialize anito-cel and next-generation autologous and non-autologous CAR-T cell therapy products that use the same D-domain BCMA binder used in anito-cel, in each case for the treatment of MM. We also granted Kite an option to include autologous CAR-T-cell therapy products that utilize our ARC-SparX platform that are directed to BCMA, such as ACLX-001, as well as ARC-SparX products directed to CS1. In December 2023, we amended the Kite Collaboration Agreement, expanding the scope of the collaboration to include lymphomas. Kite also exercised its option to negotiate a license for ACLX-001.

In connection with the initial Kite Collaboration Agreement, we received a $225 million upfront cash payment in February 2023 and will be eligible to receive up to approximately $3.9 billion in clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments. In connection with the amendment to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, we received a $85 million upfront cash payment in December 2023 and are eligible for additional potential milestone payments, including for the advancement of lymphoma and the license for ACLX-001, as well as additional milestone payments, to offset prespecified development costs over a limited period of time. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we achieved a clinical milestone for anito-cel and received $68.3 million from Kite relating to enrollment in the iMMagine-1 trial.

In the United States, we and Kite will equally share profits and losses from the commercialization of the anito-cel and any next-generation autologous CAR-T cell therapy product for which we may exercise our option to co-promote with Kite (collectively, the Co-Promote Products). For Co-Promote Products outside of the United States and for any other products we may license to Kite that are not a Co-Promote Product (Non-Co-Promote Products), we will be eligible for tiered royalties in the low to mid teen percentages.

We and Kite will jointly develop the Co-Promote Products in accordance with mutually agreed development plans and development budgets. We will conduct the iMMagine-1 trial for anito-cel and Kite will conduct all other development of the other Co-Promote Products. Other than certain items expressly set forth in the Kite Collaboration Agreement and amendment, the out-of-pocket development costs for activities conducted in the United States for Co-Promote Products will be shared equally by us and Kite, and the out-of-pocket development costs for activities conducted outside the United States as part of a global clinical trial for Co-Promote Products will be borne 60% by Kite and 40% by us, however Kite will be solely responsible for the costs for country-specific clinical trials and CMC commercial readiness. Kite will be solely responsible for the conduct of development of the Non-Co-Promote Products at its sole cost. In the United States, we and Kite will be jointly responsible for commercialization of the Co-Promote Products. Kite will be responsible, at its sole cost, for commercialization of the Co-Promote Products outside the United States and the Non-Co-Promote Products worldwide. Kite will manufacture the licensed products and bear the CMC commercial readiness costs and capital expenses, except that we are responsible for manufacturing anito-cel prior to transferring the manufacturing process to Kite and the parties share associated out-of-pocket costs.

Unless earlier terminated, the Kite Collaboration Agreement will continue in effect until no licensed products are being developed or commercialized. The Kite Collaboration Agreement is subject to customary termination provisions including termination by a party for the other party’s uncured, material breach. In the event of certain terminations of the Kite Collaboration Agreement, we are entitled to certain reversionary rights with respect to the terminated products.

The Kite Collaboration Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and terms governing the prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property.

In connection with the Kite Collaboration Agreement, we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) and a standstill and stock restriction agreement (the Standstill Agreement) with Gilead Sciences (Gilead) in December 2022, pursuant to which, upon closing in January 2023, we issued and sold to Gilead 3,478,261 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $100.0 million and Gilead agreed to certain transfer and standstill restrictions and received certain registration rights. In connection with the amendment to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, in December 2023, we entered into a second common stock purchase agreement with Gilead and amended and restated the standstill and stock restriction agreement (the Amended Standstill Agreement), pursuant to which we issued and sold to Gilead 3,242,542 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $200.0 million which shares are also subject to certain transfer and standstill restrictions and registration rights.

Intellectual Property

Developing intellectual property is a vital component of our business plan for maximizing return on our investments. We actively develop intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending United States and international patent rights for our product candidates, processes, and our discovery, development, and therapeutic platforms. We pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in strategic areas to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the commercial development of our business and our competitive position. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of the technology, inventions and improvements that cannot be patented but are important to the development of our business and competitive position. We have spent considerable effort securing intellectual property rights, including patent rights related to our proprietary D-Domain binding domain, ARC and SparX protein technologies and to our product candidates.

As of December 31, 2024, our patent portfolio includes four patent families directed to the proprietary D-Domain binding domain technology.

•
The first patent family broadly covers libraries of our proprietary D-Domain binding domains, compositions comprising our proprietary D-Domain binding domains and methods of using our proprietary D-Domain binding domains. This family includes 21 issued patents (including 3 issued U.S. patents) and 20 pending applications. Specifically,  issued/granted claims encompass anito-cel and universal ARC-T-cells, ACLX-001: BCMA and ACLX-002: CD123 SparXs, and methods of use thereof in the treatment of cancer. Patents in this  first family are expected to expire in 2036, not including any patent term adjustment and patent term extension. 

•
The second patent family is directed to proprietary D-Domain binding domains that bind commercially relevant target antigens and fusion polypeptides containing these domains. The second family includes 6 issued patents (including 3 issued U.S. patents) and 24 pending applications. The issued/granted claims encompass anito-cel, ARC-T-cells, ACLX-001: BCMA and ACLX-002: CD123 SparXs. Issued patents from the second family are expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustment and patent term extension.

•
The third patent family is directed to proprietary D-Domain binding domains that bind commercially relevant target antigens and fusion polypeptides containing these domains. The patent family includes an issued U.S. patent, and 18 pending applications (both domestic and foreign). Any patent issuing from the family is expected to expire in 2042, not including any patent term adjustment and patent term extension. 

•
The fourth patent family is directed to proprietary D-Domain binding domains that bind commercially relevant target antigens and fusion polypeptides containing these domains. The family includes a pending international patent application. Any patent issuing from the family is expected to expire in 2042, not including any patent term adjustment and patent term extension.

As of December 31, 2024, our patent portfolio also includes two patent families directed to the proprietary ARC-SparX platform technology.

•
One patent family is directed to our ARC construct and SparX protein technologies, and to methods of using them in T cell-based and other therapeutic applications. This family includes 6 issued patents and 21 pending applications. Any patent issuing from the family is expected to expire in 2038, not including any patent term adjustment and patent term extension. 

•
A second patent family is directed to dosing regimens for employing the proprietary ARC-SparX platform technology in therapeutic methods. The family includes pending applications in the U.S. and in 15 foreign jurisdictions. Any patent issuing from the family is expected to expire in 2042, not including any patent term adjustment and patent term extension.

In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know-how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.

As of December 31, 2024, our trademark portfolio contains U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for the ARCELLX and ARCELLX logo, trademarks, and certain foreign trademark registrations for the marks ARC-SPARX and ARC-T.

We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Therefore, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.

The patent and other intellectual property positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development, commercial strategies, drugs or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
