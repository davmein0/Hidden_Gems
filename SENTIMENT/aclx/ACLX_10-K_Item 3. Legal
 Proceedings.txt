em 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the sections titled "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. For convenience of presentation, some of the numbers have been rounded in the text below. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy through the development of innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases. We believe cell therapies are one of the forward pillars of medicine, and our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective and more broadly accessible. Although cell therapies have shown benefits to date, cell therapies have primarily been constrained to existing biologic structures, which has limited their impact and opportunity. Our novel synthetic binding scaffold, the D-Domain, is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts). Existing cell therapy solutions, most of which use a biologic-based, single chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domain, tend to be difficult to manufacture, beneficial to a limited segment of patients, often result in high toxicity, and have narrow applicability in treatable indications. We believe we can address these limitations by engineering a new class of D-Domain powered cell therapies, including classical single infusion CAR-Ts called “ddCARs” and dosable and controllable universal CAR-Ts called “ARC-SparX”, to address hematologic cancers, solid tumors, and indications outside of oncology, such as autoimmune diseases.

Our lead program is a BCMA-targeting ddCAR product candidate called “anito-cel”, which is currently being evaluated in our pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1 and the Phase 3 iMMagine-3 trials in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM). We have partnered anito-cel with Kite Pharma Inc., a Gilead company (Kite), through our co-development/co-commercialization collaboration agreement (as described in more detail in the section below titled “Components of Results of Operations - Revenue" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Recently, Kite initiated a global Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial (iMMagine-3) of anito-cel in patients with second through fourth line rrMM. Kite will manufacture anito-cel for iMMagine-3. This follows the completion of the technical transfer to Kite, which was announced in May 2024, as well as the transfer to Kite of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for anito-cel in rrMM, which has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Outside of our collaboration with Kite, we intend to evaluate anito-cel for the treatment of certain non-oncology indications, including some autoimmune disorders. We received FDA clearance of an IND application and have initiated a Phase 1 trial in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in 2024.

We also are developing two clinical-stage ARC-SparX programs in Phase 1 trials, ACLX-001, which targets BCMA in rrMM, and our wholly-owned ACLX-002, which targets CD123 in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In November 2023, Kite exercised its option under the Kite Collaboration Agreement to negotiate a license for ACLX-001.

Since our formation, we have devoted substantially all our resources to discovering and developing our product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses to date. Our net losses were $107.3 million, $70.7 million, and $188.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Our accumulated deficit totaled $496.8 million as of December 31, 2024. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of and expenditures on our planned research and development activities. We expect our operating expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:

•
Advance the clinical program for anito-cel and subsequent clinical trials focused on earlier lines of therapy in collaboration with our partner Kite; 

113

•
Grow our supply and contract manufacturing infrastructure to support the continued development of anito-cel and our other product candidates; 

•
Initiate clinical trials to evaluate anito-cel in other indications outside of oncology, such as generalized myasthenia gravis;

•
Initiate or continue to advance clinical trials to evaluate our clinical-stage ARC-SparX product candidates, ACLX-001 and ACLX-002, and other preclinical pipeline programs; 

•
Expand our pipeline of product candidates, including through our own product discovery and development efforts or through acquisition or in-licensing; 

•
Continue to develop our proprietary platforms to extend their use; 

•
Attract, hire, and retain additional clinical, scientific, manufacturing, management and administrative personnel;

•
Add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development, as well as to support us as a public reporting company; 

•
Determine and execute our long-term manufacturing strategy for anito-cel in collaboration with our partner Kite;

•
Pursue regulatory approval of product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

•
Establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and

•
Obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.

As a result, we may require substantial additional funding to develop our product candidates and our platforms and to support our continuing operations. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval, and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements, other collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, if at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition, and could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. We may also be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our development efforts. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.

Based on our expected operating cash requirements and capital expenditures, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are adequate to fund operations into 2027.

Recent Developments

In December 2024, we announced preliminary data from our pivotal iMMagine-1 study in patients with rrMM, which were presented during an oral presentation at the 66th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition.

In November 2024, we announced with Kite that the first patients have been dosed in the global iMMagine-3 randomized control trial evaluating anito-cel in patients with rrMM exposed to an immunomodulatory (IMiD) drug and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future. Our revenue consists of amounts recognized from our collaboration with Kite for our research and development performed under the Kite Collaboration Agreement and its amendment, recognized on a cost-to-cost percentage of completion basis applied to the total estimated transaction price. In the future, we may generate revenue from payments received under the Kite Collaboration Agreement and its amendment, including payments of upfront fees, license fees, milestone-based payments, and reimbursements for research and development efforts.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development Expenses

We expense research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We track external costs on a program-by-program basis beginning with lead candidate selection. External costs that are not allocated to a program are classified as preclinical and discovery costs. We do not track internal costs by program because these costs are deployed across multiple programs, and as such, are not separately classified.

Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal costs incurred in connection with our anito-cel program, the development of our ARC-SparX product candidates, and the ongoing discovery and development efforts for additional product candidates.

External expenses include:

•
Payments to third parties in connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, including contract research organizations (CROs) and consultants; 

•
The cost of manufacturing products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including payments to contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and consultants; 

•
Payments to third parties in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates, including outsourced professional scientific development services, consulting research fees and for sponsored research arrangements with third parties; 

•
Laboratory supplies used in the preclinical development of our product candidates; and 

•
Allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for IT, rent and maintenance of facilities. 

Internal expenses include employee-related costs, including salaries, related benefits, and share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions.

Our Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. (Lonza) expired in December 2024. Previously, we had identified embedded leases within the agreement, which had resulted in right-of-use assets that were expensed as research and development expenses in 2022 and 2023 as the right-of-use assets had no alternative future use.

Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to advance anito-cel, in multiple myeloma and other indications outside of oncology, through clinical development, the regulatory approval process and, if approved, commercial launch activities; initiate or continue to advance our ARC-SparX product candidates, including expanding ACLX-001 and ACLX-002; continue to discover and develop additional product candidates to expand our pipeline; maintain, expand, protect, and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel.

115

The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, and we do not believe it is possible at this time to accurately project the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. To the extent our product candidates continue to advance into clinical trials, as well as advance into larger and later-stage clinical trials, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from our product candidates to offset these expenses. Our ability to eventually generate significant revenues from product sales will depend on a number of factors, including:

•
Successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;  

•
Sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

•
Achieving favorable results from clinical trials;  

•
Receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;  

•
Establishing and maintaining sufficient manufacturing capabilities, whether internally or with third parties, including securing raw material supply;  

•
Existence of, and our ability to identify, an addressable patient population for our product candidates;

•
Effectively competing with other therapies;  

•
Maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of any product following approval, if any; 

•
Submission of INDs or other regulatory applications for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials and authorizations from regulators to initiate clinical trials;  

•
Identification of additional target antigens for desired indications;  

•
Identification and engineering of D-Domain-based binding regions that bind to the desired target antigens; 

•
Developing and implementing successful marketing and reimbursement strategies;

•
Obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and

•
The market opportunities for certain of our product candidates may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and may be small, and our projections regarding the size of the addressable market may be incorrect.

Any changes in the outcome of any of these factors could significantly impact the costs, timing, and viability associated with the development of our product candidates and our ability to generate significant revenues from product sales.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits, and share-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include allocated facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance, not otherwise included in research and development expenses, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services.

We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we increase our headcount to support the growth of the company.

Other Income, net

116

Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities, net accretion and amortization on marketable securities and interest expense related to our finance lease obligations.

Income Tax Provision

We have recorded an income tax expense of $2.1 million, $663 thousand and zero for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Based on the available objective evidence during the year ended December 31, 2024, we believe it is not more likely than not that the tax benefits of our net deferred income tax assets may be realized. Accordingly, we did not record the tax benefits of net deferred income tax assets previously incurred as of December 31, 2024. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate relates to change in state deferred income tax rate.

Research and development expenses were $157.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $23.2 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in internal costs of $21.3 million due to higher personnel-related costs, of which $10.4 million was due to non-cash share-based compensation; an increase of  $5.4 million in anito-cel programs; an increase of $8.6 million in costs relating to ACLX-002 program; and an increase of $17.7 million in costs relating to other pipeline programs (including ACLX-003 in AML, anito-cel in myasthenia gravis, and additional discovery programs). The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $28.8 million relating to expense in our anito-cel clinical program for a related right of use asset associated with an embedded lease for our Lonza manufacturing services agreement for which there is no alternative use.

Research and development expenses were $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $15.7 million. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease of $29.0 million relating to expense in our anito-cel clinical program for a related right of use asset associated with an embedded lease for our Lonza manufacturing services agreement for which there is no alternative use. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $6.2 million in external costs. There was a decrease of $7.2 million in manufacturing costs associated with other clinical programs. Internal costs had an increase of $9.1 million in personnel related costs due to an increase in headcount ($4.0 million of which was due to non-cash stock-based compensation expense), an increase of $4.1 million in facilities costs, and an increase of $1.2 million in depreciation expenses.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses were $88.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $66.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $22.1 million. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $14.4 million in personnel-related costs, of which $8.9 million was due to non-cash stock-based compensation, and an increase of $3.4 million in depreciation expense, and $2.0 million in commercial readiness.

General and administrative expenses were $66.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $24.6 million. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $19.3 million in personnel related costs due to an increase in headcount ($16.2 million of which was due to non-cash stock-based compensation expense), $3.2 million in facilities costs, and $1.4 million in consulting fees.

Other income, net

Other income, net was $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $12.4 million. This increase was driven primarily by higher marketable securities balances and a corresponding increase in the interest earned.

Other income, net was $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $17.3 million. This increase was driven primarily by higher overall cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and a corresponding increase in the interest earned.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations and we expect to incur substantial additional losses in future periods. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $625.7 million.

To date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize any of, our product candidates, except that we recognize revenue under the Kite Collaboration Agreement and its amendment on a cost-to-cost percentage of completion basis applied to the total estimated transaction price. We may also enter into other collaborative agreements with third parties, and we do not know when, or if, any will occur. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Moreover, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, particularly relating to our loss of emerging growth company and smaller reporting company status. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

Based on our expected operating cash requirements and capital expenditures, we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are adequate to fund operations into 2027.

118

In May 2023, we entered into a sales agreement (Sales Agreement) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company (Stifel) with respect to an at-the-market offering program under which we may issue and sell, from time to time and at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, in an aggregate offering amount of up to $350.0 million. Stifel acts as our sales agent and will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of common stock from time to time, based upon instruction from us. We will pay Stifel up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sales of any common stock sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement and have agreed to provide Stifel with customary indemnification and contribution rights, plus reimbursement for specified expenses it incurred in connection with entering into the agreement. No sales of our common stock have been made under this arrangement as of December 31, 2024.

Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 of $83.5 million was attributable to our net loss of $107.3 million, partially offset by adjustments to net loss of $54.7 million. The adjustments to net loss primarily consist of share-based compensation of $61.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $5.2 million, and noncash operating lease expense of $3.3 million, partially offset by amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities of $15.5 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash by $30.8 million, primarily due to changes in contract liability to related party of $86.2 million and operating lease liabilities of $3.8 million, partially offset by changes in prepaid assets and other current and non-current assets of $8.6 million, other non-current liabilities of $8.6 million, and accrued liabilities of $41.9 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 of $207.6 million was attributable to our net loss of $70.7 million, partially offset by adjustments to net loss of $52.8 million, primarily consisting of expensing of a right-of-use asset of $18.9 million, share-based compensation of $41.8 million, and depreciation and amortization of $2.0 million, offset by net amortization and accretion on marketable securities of $11.0 million.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of $24.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 consists of $39.8 million payments under our finance lease from our Lonza manufacturing services agreement which ended in December 2024, offset by $15.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $279.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of $299.7 million proceeds from issuance of common stock to related party, $7.8 million proceeds from exercise of stock options, offset by payments under our finance lease totaling $29.4 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $252.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of $129.2 million raised in our IPO, $120.7 million raised in a follow-on public offering, and $10.0 million raised in a private placement, all net of transaction costs. In addition $2.5 million was received from the exercise of stock options, offset by payments under our finance lease totaling $9.7 million.

Contractual Obligations and Contingencies

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract manufacturers for manufacturing services for our clinical trials and contract research organizations for preclinical studies, clinical trials and other services, which are generally cancellable upon written notice. In addition, certain agreements with our CMOs and third-party vendors contain development and commercial milestone payments and low single-digit royalties on worldwide net sales for certain products we sell that incorporate certain goods provided by our manufacturers and suppliers. As of December 31, 2024, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones or making future product sales.

Our operating lease obligations primarily consist of lease payments on our research, lab and office facilities in Rockville, Maryland and Redwood City, California. For additional information regarding our lease obligations, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a periodic basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical for fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"). 
We recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in a contract for an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer.

120

We evaluate the promised goods or services in these agreements to determine which ones represent distinct performance obligations. These agreements may include the following types of promised goods or services: (i) grants of licenses; (ii) performance of development services and manufacturing activities, (iii) performance of manufacturing transfer, and (iv) participation on joint committees. The payment terms of these agreements may include nonrefundable upfront fees, cost-sharing arrangements, payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, and royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration.

We exercise judgment in assessing those promised goods and services that are distinct and thus representative of performance obligations. To the extent we identify multiple performance obligations in a contract, we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation in order to allocate the transaction price among the identified performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis.

Prior to recognizing revenue, we make estimates of the transaction price, including variable consideration that is subject to a constraint. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required.

We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligations when or as the performance obligations are satisfied. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we estimate the efforts needed to complete the performance obligations and recognize revenue by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligations using an input measure. The estimated period of performance and level of effort, including third-party costs, are reviewed quarterly and adjusted, as needed, to reflect our current expectations. The measurement of progress is then used to calculate revenue, including any revenue adjustments as a result of the change in estimate. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including commercial milestone payments based on pre-specified level of sales, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligations to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Achievement of these royalties and commercial milestones may solely depend upon the performance of the licensee. Funds received in advance are recorded as contract liabilities and are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.

Accrued research and development expenses

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits of research and development personnel, costs related to research activities, preclinical studies, and overhead and facility-related costs. We account for advanced payments, including non-refundable amounts, for goods or services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the related goods have been received or when the service has been performed, or such a time when we do not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be performed, rather than when the payment is made.

Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on estimates and representations from service providers regarding work performed, including actual level of patient enrollment, completion of patient studies, and progress of the clinical trials. Other incidental costs related to patient enrollment or treatment are accrued when reasonably certain. Similarly, we accrue expenses related to the work performed by CMOs based on the progress of the work performed. If the amounts that we are obligated to pay under clinical trial agreements and manufacturing agreements are modified (for instance, as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), the accruals are adjusted accordingly. Revisions to contractual payment obligations are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.

Share-based compensation

We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards or restricted stock units (together, stock awards), to be recognized as expense based on their grant date fair values. Our policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur.

We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing (Black-Scholes) model for stock option grants to both employees and non-employees. We will reconsider the use of the Black-Scholes model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that prevent their value from being reasonably estimated using this model.

121

The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions. Our methodology for developing the assumptions used in the valuation model are as follows:

Fair Value of Common Stock
—See the subsection titled “Determination of the fair value of our common stock and fair value of total equity” below.

Expected Dividend Yield
—The expected dividend yield is based on our historical and expected dividend payouts. We have historically paid no dividends and do not anticipate dividends to be paid in the future.

Expected Equity Volatility
—Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock (prior to our IPO) and the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us (e.g., public entities of similar size, complexity, stage of development and industry focus). The historical volatility is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with expected term assumption.

Risk-Free Interest Rate
—The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options.

Expected Term
—We use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.

Our share-based compensation related to stock options subject to service conditions are recognized as expense ratably over the required service period based on their grant date fair values.

The fair value of restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, and restricted stock units (collectively, awards), unless a market condition exists, is determined based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. Vesting of awards is accelerated for certain employees in the event of a change in control or in the event that we remove the employee with or without cause from their position.

We estimate the fair value of awards subject to both a market condition and a performance condition on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For awards with vesting subject to the fulfillment of both market and performance conditions, share-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method beginning when the achievement of the performance condition becomes probable over the applicable service period. The amount of share-based compensation expense is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the performance condition being satisfied and our estimate, which may vary over time, of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. If the performance condition is not met, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.

We have granted restricted stock unit awards to our chief executive officer (CEO) which are subject to service, performance, and market conditions. For more information about these awards, see Note 13, Share Based Compensation - Restricted Stock Units - Chief Executive Officer. We used the Monte Carlo simulation model approach to estimate the fair value of such award on the date of grant. In applying the Monte Carlo methodology, the total equity value on various measurement dates were simulated and allocated to the various classes of equity in our capital structure according to the characteristics of that capital structure, such as the number of shares of each class of equity, seniority levels, liquidation preferences and conversion values for redeemable convertible preferred stock, and participation thresholds for common stock and each series of redeemable convertible preferred stock. The fair value of each such award is the average of the discounted proceeds to the common stock across all simulated paths.

Application of the Monte Carlo simulation model required various subjective assumptions that represent management’s best estimates of the fair value of common stock, expected equity volatility, risk-free interest rate, discount period, expected dividend yield, and time to achievement of a performance condition:

Fair Value of Common Stock and Fair Value of Total Equity
—See the subsection titled “Determination of the fair value of our common stock and fair value of total equity” below.

122

Expected Equity Volatility
—Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock (prior to our IPO) and the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us (e.g., public entities of similar size, complexity, stage of development, and industry focus). The historical volatility is calculated based on a period commensurate with the expected date of achievement of a performance condition.

Risk-Free Interest Rate and Discount Period
—The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected time to achieve of a performance condition. The discount period is the period between the valuation date and the assumed change in control event date, with the assumption that all equity shares in the capital structure are paid out in cash.

Expected Dividend Yield
—The expected dividend yield is based on our historical and expected dividend payouts. We have historically paid no dividends and does not anticipate dividends to be paid in the future.

Expected Time to Achievement of a Performance Condition
—The time to the achievement of a performance condition is based on our best estimate of the period of time to achievement of a performance condition that attains the established market capitalization thresholds.

Ite
m 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $625.7 million and $729.2 million, respectively, primarily invested in U.S. government agency securities and treasuries, certificate of deposit, corporate bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are primarily in short-term securities. Our available-for-sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. A 10% change in the interest rates in effect on December 31, 2024 would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year on December 31, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

123

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for to permit preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2024, of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Arcellx, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arcellx, Inc. and its subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit) and of cash flows for the year then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

131

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition – Kite Collaboration Agreement Third Party Contract Costs

As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated revenue was $107.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, all of which relates to the Kite Collaboration Agreement.  Management uses a cost-based input method to measure proportional performance and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize. In applying the cost-based input method of revenue recognition, management measures actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs to fulfill the combined performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of third-party contract costs. Revenue is recognized based on actual costs incurred as a percentage of total budgeted costs as the Company completes its performance obligations.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the revenue recognition – Kite collaboration agreement third party contract costs is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to third-party contract costs.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the third-party contract costs. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of a sample of third party contract costs incurred by tracing information to the underlying vendor contracts, purchase orders, and invoices, (ii) confirming information directly with a sample of external vendors such as key terms and actual costs, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the third party contract costs incurred for the services that have not been invoiced by examining vendor contracts to assess the completeness and accuracy of these costs, and (iv) recalculating revenue recognized based on third party contract costs.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Arcellx, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arcellx, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accounting for the Kite Collaboration Agreement

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, in January 2023 the Company closed on a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Kite Pharma Inc ("Kite") under which it identified one single combined performance obligation for development, manufacture, and commercialization licenses, research and development activities, manufacturing activities, and the transfer of manufacturing know-how. For the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue recognized from the Collaboration Agreement was $110.3 million.

Auditing the Company’s accounting for the Collaboration Agreement was challenging because of the significant judgement in the determination of the distinct performance obligation.

133

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

To audit the Company’s determination of the performance obligation in the Collaboration Agreement, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, inspecting the executed Collaboration Agreement and comparing the promised activities to those identified by the Company.  In addition, we obtained representations from management and performed inquires of Company individuals from outside of the accounting department to corroborate the nature of the activities being performed by the Company under the Collaboration Agreement. We also inspected other Company prepared presentations and communications regarding the Collaboration Agreement to identify any potential contrary information.

which management believes will be sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months following the date of issuance of these financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Arcellx, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

139

Use of Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, estimates related to the fair value of assets, collaboration revenue, research and development accruals, and share-based compensation. Although actual results could differ from those estimates, management does not believe that such differences would be material.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company deposits its cash primarily in checking and sweep accounts with commercial banks and financial institutions in amounts exceeding FDIC insurance limits. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds.

The Company is required to maintain cash collateral on deposit in segregated money market bank accounts and certificate of deposit accounts as a condition of its lease agreements on its properties, equal to the required security deposit amounts. These amounts are presented as restricted cash, current and non-current on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The following table reconciles cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash per the balance sheets to the statements of cash flows (in thousands):

Marketable Securities

The Company carries marketable securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value as determined by prices for identical or similar securities at the balance sheet date. The inputs used to determine the fair value of marketable securities are considered Level 2 within the fair-value hierarchy. The Company records unrealized gains and losses as a component of other comprehensive loss within the statements of operations and comprehensive loss and as accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific identification method and the Company includes net realized gains and losses in other income, net. Marketable securities are classified as either current or non-current assets based on their contractual maturity dates.

For securities available for sale, ASU 2016-13 eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and instead requires entities to determine if impairment is related to credit loss or non-credit loss. In making the assessment of whether a loss is from credit or other factors, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and adverse conditions related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance is created, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Subsequent activity related to the credit loss component in the form of write-offs or recoveries is recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses on securities available for sale. The Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on securities from the estimate of credit losses.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of accounts payable and accrued expenses generally approximate their respective fair value due to their short-term nature.

140

The Company accounts for recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The ASC 820 hierarchy ranks the quality of reliability of inputs, or assumptions, used in the determination of fair value and requires assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1—Fair value is determined by using unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2—Fair value is determined by using inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable. Inputs can include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in inactive markets. Related inputs can also include those used in valuation or other pricing models, such as interest rates and yield curves that can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3—Fair value is determined by inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data. Use of these inputs involves significant and subjective judgments to be made by a reporting entity—e.g., determining an appropriate adjustment to a discount factor for illiquidity associated with a given security.

To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination o
f fair values requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at an accredited financial institution in amounts that exceed federally insured limits. The Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk
 beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. The Company invests in highly rated debt securities consisting entirely of corporate and government bonds, which the Company has the ability to liquidate within one-day should the need for additional cash arise. Accordingly, the Company believes the exposure to credit risk on its marketable securities portfolio is low.
Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method. Upon retirement or disposal, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is recognized within operating expenses. Routine expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Estim
ated useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:

Estimated Useful Life

Computer equipment

3
 years

Furniture and fixtures

7
 years

Lab equipment

7
 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term

Equipment under finance lease

Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

T
he Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived asset group when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the long-lived asset group is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset group, the Company then determines the fair value of the underlying asset group. Any impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group.

141

Collaborative Arrangements and Contracts with Customers
The Company assesses whether its collaboration agreements are subject to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (ASC 808) based on whether they involve joint operating activities and whether both parties have active participation in the arrangement and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the joint operating activities. To the extent that the arrangement falls within the scope of ASC 808, the Company applies the unit of account guidance under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), to identify distinct performance obligations, and then determine whether a customer relationship exists for each distinct performance obligation. If the Company determines whether a promised good or service within the arrangement is with a customer, it applies the guidance in ASC 606. If a portion of a distinct bundle of goods or services within an arrangement is not with a customer, then the unit of account is not within the scope of ASC 606, and the recognition and measurement of that unit of account shall be based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or, if there is no appropriate analogy, a reasonable, rational, and consistently applied accounting policy election.
The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in a contract for an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. As part of the accounting for contracts with customers, the Company develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company then allocates the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on their estimated standalone selling prices. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. For performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company determines the appropriate measure of progress. The effect of any change made to the measure of progress and, therefore a change to revenue, would be recorded as a change in estimate.
If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. The Company determines the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. The Company includes the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.
The Company uses a cost based input method to measure proportional performance and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize. In applying the cost based input method of revenue recognition, the Company measures actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs to fulfill the combined performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of third-party contract costs. Revenue is recognized based on actual costs incurred as a percentage of total budgeted costs as the Company completes its performance obligations. The Company uses the expected value method and most-likely-amount method to estimate variable consideration and will re-evaluate the transaction price in each reporting period, as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur.
The Company’s collaborative arrangements can have one or more of the following forms of consideration: (i) license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products; (iv) fees attributable to options to intellectual property; (v) cost-sharing or research and development (R&D) funding arrangements and (vi) profit and loss sharing. When a portion of non‑refundable upfront fees or other payments received are allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement, they are recorded as contract liabilities and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied. The Company classifies contract liabilities as current when it expects to satisfy its performance obligations within one year, and noncurrent when the Company expects to satisfy those performance obligations in greater than one year. Fees attributable to options are deferred until the option expires or is exercised. Changes to collaboration agreements are assessed for whether they represent a modification or should be accounted for as a new contract.
Upfront Payments and License Fees

142

If a license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
Cost-sharing

Under certain collaborative arrangements, the Company can be reimbursed for a portion of its research and development expenses or reimburse its collaboration partner for its research and development expenses. The Company estimates reimbursements to be received by a collaboration partner and reimbursements to be paid or payable to a collaboration partner as part of variable consideration. When these research and development services are paid to a collaboration partner, the Company reduces its contract liability.
Customer Options
Customer options, such as options granted to allow a licensee to extend a license or research term, to select additional research targets or to choose to research, develop and commercialize licensed compounds are evaluated at contract inception to determine whether those options provide a material right (i.e., an optional good or service offered for free or at a discount) to the customer. If the customer options represent a material right, the material right is treated as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. The Company allocates the transaction price to material rights based on the standalone selling price. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of a material right when the underlying goods or services are both (i) similar to the original goods or services in the contract and (ii) provided in accordance with the terms of the original contract, the Company allocates the total amount of consideration expected to be received from the customer to the total goods or services expected to be provided to the customer. Amounts allocated to any material right are recognized as revenue when or as the related future goods or services are transferred or when the option expires.
Milestone Payments
At the inception of the arrangement, the Company evaluates whether the development or sales-based milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company or the Company’s collaboration partner, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.  At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such development or sales-based milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues in the period of adjustment.

For milestone revenues related to sales-based achievements, the Company recognizes the milestone revenues in the corresponding period of the product sale, in accordance with the guidance of ASC 606-10-55-65 for contracts that include a license to intellectual property and the license is the predominant item to which the product sale relates.
Royalties
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from its collaborative arrangement.

143

Leases
The Company leases office and laboratory space and equipment. In addition, the Company enters into manufacturing supply agreements with CMOs and CDMOs to manufacture clinical product candidate materials. Such agreements may include an embedded lease due to the exclusive use of identified manufacturing facilities and equipment that are controlled by the Company and for which the Company obtains substantially all the output. The evaluation of leases that are embedded in the Company’s CMO and CDMO agreements is complex and requires judgment. If a lease arrangement is determined to exist with a lease term of more than 12 months at the lease commencement date, an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the lease commencement date based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. The lease commencement date, defined as the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use by the lessee and the date from which the Company is required to recognize lease expenses, may be different from the inception date of the contract.

An ROU asset represents the right to control the use of an identified asset over the lease term and a lease liability represents the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company uses the discount rate implicit in the lease, if available, or its incremental borrowing rate on the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU assets and related lease liabilities include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company expenses ROU assets acquired for research and development activities under ASC Topic 730, Research and Development, if they do not have alternative future use, in research and development projects or otherwise.

Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases based on the economic substance of the agreement. For operating leases, the Company recognizes lease expense related to fixed payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the Company recognizes the amortization of the ROU asset over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the underlying asset. Interest accretion on the finance lease liabilities is recorded as interest expense. For both operating and finance leases, lease expense related to variable payments is recognized as incurred based on performance or usage in accordance with the contractual agreements. For short-term lease arrangements with a term of one year or less, the Company has elected to recognize the related lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term without recording related ROU assets and lease liabilities.
The Company evaluates changes to the terms and conditions of a lease contract to determine if they result in a new lease or a modification of an existing lease. For lease modifications, the Company remeasures and reallocates the remaining consideration in the contract and reassesses the lease classification at the effective date of the modification.
The Company u
ses significant assumptions and judgment in evaluating its lease contracts and other agreements, including the determination of whether an agreement is or contains a lease, whether a change in the terms and conditions of a lease contract represent a new or modified lease, whether a lease represents an operating or finance lease, the discount rate used to determine the present value of lease obligations, and the term of a lease embedded in its manufacturing supply agreements.
Research and Development Expenses

Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of research and development personnel, costs related to research activities, preclinical studies, clinical manufacturing, technical development, and overhead and facility-related costs.

The Company makes payments in connection with clinical trials under contracts with contract research organizations that support conducting and managing clinical trials. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee, unit price, or on a time and materials basis. A portion of the obligation to make payments under these contracts depends on factors such as the successful enrollment or treatment of patients or the completion of other clinical trial milestones.

Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on estimates and/or representations from service providers regarding work performed, including actual level of patient enrollment, completion of patient trials, and progress of the clinical trials. Other incidental costs related to patient enrollment or treatment are accrued when reasonably certain. Similarly, the Company accrues expenses related to the work performed by contract manufacturing organizations based on the progress of the work performed. If the amounts the Company is obligated to pay under clinical trial agreements and manufacturing agreements are modified (for instance, as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), the accruals are adjusted accordingly. Revisions to contractual payment obligations are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.

144

The Company may
 be obligated to make upfront payments upon execution of certain research and development agreements. Advance payments, including nonrefundable amounts, for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Such amounts are recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or at such time when the Company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be performed.

Share-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, or restricted stock units, to be recognized as expense based on their grant date fair values. The determination of grant date fair value may require the Company to make assumptions as further discussed below. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much share-based compensation expense is recognized.  These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop.
Stock Options
The Company’s determination of the fair value of stock options with time-based vesting on the date of grant utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is impacted by the Company’s common stock price as well as other variables including, but not limited to, the expected term that options will remain outstanding, expected common stock price volatility over the expected term of the option awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.

The fair value of a stock-based award is recognized over the period during which an optionee is required to provide services in exchange for the option award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value determined on the date of grant and is reduced for forfeitures as they occur.

Estimating the fair value of equity-settled awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex variables as follows:
Expected Term — The Company uses the “simplified method” for estimating the expected term of options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option (generally 10 years). The Company uses the simplified method as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term that options will remain outstanding.
Expected Volatility — Due to the Company’s limited operating history and a lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company has based its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards.
Risk-Free Interest Rate — The risk-free rate assumption is based on the U.S. treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for instruments with maturities similar to the expected term of the Company’s stock options.
Expected Dividend — The Company has not issued any dividends in its history and does not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options and therefore has estimated the dividend yield to be 
zero
.

Restricted Stock Awards, Unrestricted Stock Awards, and Restricted Stock Units
The fair value of restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, and restricted stock units (collectively, awards), unless a market condition exists, is determined based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. Vesting of awards is accelerated for certain employees in the event of a change in control or in the event that we remove the employee with or without cause from their position.

145

The Company estimates the fair value of awards subject to both a market condition and a performance condition on the grant date using a 
Monte Carlo
 simulation model. For awards with vesting subject to the fulfillment of both market and performance conditions, share-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method beginning when the achievement of the performance condition becomes probable over the applicable service period. The amount of share-based compensation expense is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the performance condition being satisfied and our estimate, which may vary over time, of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. If the performance condition is not met, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.
Income Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets where, based upon the available evidence, the Company concludes that it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating its ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including its operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Because of the uncertainty of the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.

Liabilities are provided for tax benefits for which realization is uncertain. Such benefits are only recognized when the underlying tax position is considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained on examination by a taxing authority, assuming they possess full knowledge of the position and facts. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision of income taxes. As of December 31, 2024
 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 interest or penalties related to uncertain income tax positions.

Segment and Geographic Information

Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the
 chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company views its operations as and manages its business in 
one
 operating segment operating exclusively in the United States.

The Company had 
9
 securities in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate related fair value of  
$
108.4
 million
 as of December 31, 2024. The Company had 
8
 securities in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate related fair value of 
$
61.5
 million
 as of December 31, 2023. All securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 had been in a loss position for less than twelve months. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale marketable securities as of December 31, 2024
 and 2023 were not significant and were primarily due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities. Accordingly, 
no
 allowance for credit losses related to the Company’s available-for-sale marketable securities was recorded for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is unlikely that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized 
$
2.5
 million
 and $
1.4
 million, respectively, of accrued interest receivable from available-for-sale securities within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

7. Related Parties

Relationship and transactions with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead)
As of December 31, 2024
, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) held approximately 
13
% of the Company's outstanding common stock. These holdings resulted from Gilead's investment in the Company of: (i) $
100.0
 million, by purchasing 
3,478,261
 shares of common stock at a per share price of $
28.75
 pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Gilead (Gilead SPA); and (ii) $
200.0
 million, by purchasing 
3,242,542
 shares of common stock at a per share price of $
61.68
 pursuant to a second Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Gilead (Second Gilead SPA). See Note 8 for further discussion of the agreements with Gilead.

The Company partnered anito-cel with Kite Pharma, Inc., a Gilead company (Kite), through its co-development/co-commercialization collaboration agreement, as described in more detail in Note 8 Collaboration Agreement.

148

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
$
135.1
 million
 in contract liability pursuant to the Collaboration and License Agreement with Kite (Kite Collaboration Agreement) and its amendment, of which 
$
76.0
 million
 represented the long-term portion of contract liability. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized 
$
107.9
 million
 in revenue under the Kite Collaboration Agreement and its amendment. See Note 8, Collaboration Agreement, for further discussion of the Kite Collaboration Agreement.

8. Collaboration Agreement
In December 2022, the Company entered into the Kite Collaboration Agreement, the Gilead SPA and a standstill and stock restriction agreement with Gilead (the Standstill Agreement). Upon closing in January 2023, Kite made an upfront payment of $
225.0
 million and obtained a license to co-develop and co-commercialize anito-cel, and next-generation autologous and non-autologous CAR-T cell therapy products that use the same D-domain BCMA binder used in anito-cel, in each case for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The Company also granted Kite the ability to negotiate a development and commercialization license for the inclusion of a limited number of pre-specified additional autologous CAR-T-cell therapy products for the treatment of multiple myeloma, which can be exercised by Kite after the Company provides to Kite a phase 1 clinical study report. 
Gilead made an equity investment of $
100.0
 million by purchasing 
3,478,261
 shares of Arcellx common stock at a fixed per share price of $
28.75
 pursuant to the Gilead SPA, which represented a $
15.3
 million discount on the sale of the Company’s common stock based on the share price on the date of closing.
In November 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its Kite Collaboration Agreement, the Second Gilead SPA and an amended and restated standstill and stock restriction agreement with Gilead (the Amended Standstill Agreement). Upon closing in December 2023, Kite commenced negotiation of a license for the Company’s ARC-SparX program, ACLX-001, in multiple myeloma. The Company and Kite have also expanded the scope of the collaboration for the Company’s anito-cel to include lymphomas, which is subject to further negotiation by both parties in order to be developed and is therefore not a performance obligation either at contract inception or at December 31, 2024. 
In connection with the amendment to the Kite Collaboration Agreement, the Company received a $
85.0
 million upfront cash payment and are eligible for additional potential milestone payments. Gilead made an equity investment of $
200.0
 million by purchasing 
3,242,542
 shares of Arcellx common stock at a fixed per share price of $
61.68
 pursuant to the Second Gilead SPA, which represented a $
15.6
 million premium on the sale of the Company’s common stock based on the share price on the date of closing.
Under the Kite Collaboration Agreement and its amendment, the Company will be eligible to receive additional clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments of up to $
530.0
 million, $
935.0
 million and $
507.5

million, for anito-cel, each next-generation autologous CAR-T cell therapy product, and each non-autologous CAR-T cell therapy product, respectively. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company achieved a clinical milestone for anito-cel relating to enrollment in the iMMagine-1 trial and received $
68.3
 million from Kite.
In the United States, the Company and Kite will equally share profits and losses from the commercialization of anito-cel and any next-generation autologous CAR-T cell therapy product for which the Company has exercised its option to co-promote with Kite (collectively, the Co-Promote Products). The Company has the option to designate next-generation autologous CAR-T therapy product as a Co-Promote Product after Kite provides the first phase 1 clinical study report for such product with the proposed core development plan and budget. For Co-Promote Products outside of the United States and for any other products worldwide that are not a Co-Promote Product (Non-Co-Promote Products), including any next-generation autologous CAR-T cell therapy product for which the company has opted out of designating as a Co-Promote Product, the Company will be eligible for tiered royalties in the low to mid teen percentages. The Company and Kite will jointly develop the Co-Promote Products in accordance with mutually agreed development plans and development budgets. On a Co-Promote Product-by-Co-Promote Product basis, the Company may, upon advance written notice to Kite, opt out of sharing development costs and profits and losses from the commercialization of such Co-Promote Product (for example, anito-cel), in which case, it will become a Non-Co-Promote Product and eligible for tiered royalties in the low to mid teen percentages.
Other than certain items expressly set forth in the Kite Collaboration Agreement and its amendment, the out-of-pocket development costs for activities conducted in the United States for Co-Promote Products will be shared equally by the Company and Kite. The out-of-pocket development costs for activities conducted outside the United States as part of a global clinical trial for Co-Promote Products will be borne 
60
% by Kite and 
40
% by the Company, however Kite will be solely responsible for its costs for country-specific clinical trials and chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) commercial readiness. Kite will be solely responsible for the conduct of development and commercialization of the Non-Co-Promote Products at its sole cost. 
In the United States, the Company and Kite will be jointly responsible for commercialization of the Co-Promote Products. Kite will manufacture the licensed products and bear the CMC commercial readiness costs and capital expenses, except that the Company is responsible for manufacturing anito-cel prior to transferring the manufacturing process to Kite and the parties share associated out-of-pocket costs. Reimbursement costs expected to be received from Kite or paid to Kite represent variable consideration and are included in the estimated transaction price.

149

The Company’s promises under the Kite Collaboration Agreement include development, manufacture, and commercialization licenses, research and development activities, manufacturing activities, and the transfer of manufacturing know-how to Kite (collectively, the research and development services). These promises represent a single combined performance obligation as the promises are not distinct from each other. The Company determined that the license and research and development services are combined based on the specialized nature of the Company’s know-how and manufacturing process.
The Company evaluated the amendment to the Kite Collaboration Agreement and determined that the contract modifications should be accounted for as changes to the original contract, as the services to be provided after the contract modification are not distinct from those services already provided.

The Company uses a cost based input method to measure proportional performance and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize. In applying the cost based input method of revenue recognition, the Company measures actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs to fulfill the combined performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of third-party contract costs. Revenue is recognized based on actual costs incurred as a percentage of total budgeted costs as the Company completes its performance obligations. The Company uses the expected value method and most-likely-amount method to estimate variable consideration and will re-evaluate the transaction price in each reporting period, as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur.
During the year ended December 31, 2024
, 
no
 revenue was recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. As of 
December 31, 2024, the amount of the transaction price that has not been recognized as revenue was 
$
50.2
 million
, which may be recognized as revenue over the period of time the Company is performing the research and development activities.

As of 
December 31, 2024, the balances in contract liability were as follows (in thousands):

9. Leases

Operating Leases

In July 2022, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement for 
57,902
 square feet of office and laboratory space in Rockville, Maryland for a term of approximately 
12.9
 years. The lease contains annual rent escalation and rent abatement clauses as well as an allowance of approximately $
12.1
 million for tenant improvements. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the landlord and the Company agreed to convert $
2.8
 million of rent abatement to tenant improvement allowance and agreed to an additional tenant improvement allowance of $
2.9
 million. The changes were accounted for as lease modifications. 
The Rockville lease provides for optional two 
five-year
 extensions.
 The optional period is not included in the lease term used to determine the ROU asset or lease liability associated with this lease as the Company did not consider it reasonably certain it would exercise the option.

In May 2022, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement for 
51,822
 square feet of office and laboratory space in Redwood City, California for a term of approximately 
11.7
 years. The lease contains annual rent escalation and rent abatement clauses as well as an allowance of approximately $
9.8
 million for tenant improvements. 
The Redwood City lease provides for an optional 
five-year
 extension.
 The optional period is not included in the lease term used to determine the ROU asset or lease liability associated with this lease as the Company did not consider it reasonably certain it would exercise the option.

The Company also leases office and laboratory space in Gaithersburg, Maryland that has a term that expires in 
2030
 unless renewed. This operating lease agreement contains rent escalation, rent abatement clauses, tenant improvement allowances, and optional renewal clauses. 
On January 30, 2024, the Company entered into an Assignment of Lease with a third party sublessee, pursuant to which the Company agreed to transfer and assign to a sublessee all of our rights, title, and interest under the Gaithersburg, Maryland Lease.

150

All three operating leases include variable lease payments, which are primarily related to common area maintenance, taxes and utility charges. The Company also has short-term operating leases with a term of one year or less.

Finance Leases
Pursuant to a manufacturing services agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. (Lonza) in connection with the development and manufacture of autologous drug product anito-cel (Lonza Agreement), the Company entered into a statement of work with Lonza (Lonza SOW) in February 2022, for the technology transfer and cGMP manufacturing of anito-cel and potentially other pipeline products. The Lonza SOW contains an embedded lease as the Company has exclusive use of, and control over, a portion of manufacturing facilities during the contractual term. The Lonza SOW also contains an agreement to purchase inventory that is accounted for separately.
 Lease commencement occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2022 when the applicable manufacturing facility and equipment became available for cGMP manufacturing under the Company's exclusive use and control. The arrangement provides the Company the ability to early terminate for any reason upon 
12 months
 prior notification to Lonza. The Company did not consider it reasonably certain it would terminate the arrangement when determining the lease term. The arrangement expired in 
December 2024
. Variable costs under this arrangement include materials, externa
l testing, and other services.

The Company elected the practical expedient to combine the lease component and the non-lease components associated with the lease component as a single lease component, except as related to the non-lease component associated with purchase of inventory. The related ROU assets represent assets acquired for research and development activities with no alternative future use and therefore were immediately expensed in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2022 in the amount of $
63.3
 million.

In September 2023, the Company signed Amendment 1 to the Lonza SOW entered into in February 2022. The Amendment 1 increased quantity of manufacturing slots from September 2023 through the end of the lease in 
December 2024
, providing the Company additional exclusive use of and control over an additional portion of the manufacturing facilities during the term that was previously shared. The Company now has exclusive use of, and control over, the additional facility space and equipment through the remainder of the lease term.
This change under Amendment 1 was accounted for as a lease modification, and the Company remeasured the lease liabilities for the modified lease as of the Amendment effective date. The remeasurement of the lease liabilities included fixed consideration with an undiscounted value of approximately $
51.7
 million, or $
48.5
 million discounted using the expected payment timeline and the incremental borrowing rate of 
10.8
%, resulting in an increase of $
15.9
 million in lease liabilities. As the Company acquired ROU assets that represented assets acquired for research and development activities that did not have an alternative future use, the Company recorded the ROU assets as research and development expense immediately in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2023 in the amount of $
18.9
 million.

1. Commitments and Contingencies

Commercial and Development Milestones
In addition to the arrangement with Lonza, we have entered into other contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs, and other third parties for preclinical research studies and testing, clinical trials, and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior notice. For such contracts, payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. We have also entered into agreements with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which include manufacturing services with CMOs and development services with CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payments for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amount of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreement. In addition, certain agreements with our CMOs and third-party vendors contain (a) development and commercial milestone payments and low single-digit royalties on worldwide net sales for certain products we sell that incorporate certain goods provided by our manufacturers and suppliers, (b) development milestones of up to 
$
25.3
 million
 in the aggregate and (c) commercial milestones of up to 
$
52.0
 million
 in the aggregate, along with royalty buyout provisions.
Purchase Commitments
The Company conducts product research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs that include, among others, arrangements with universities, contract research organizations and clinical research sites. The Company has contractual arrangements with these organizations; however, these contracts are generally cancelable on 
30 
days’ notice and the obligations under these contracts are largely based on services performed.
Contingencies

From time to time, the Company may be subject to various litigation and related matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was not involved in any material legal proceedings.

Indemnification Agreements

As permitted under Delaware law, the Company indemnifies its executive officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the executive officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The term of this indemnification is for the officer’s or director’s lifetime. Additionally, the Company has entered into and expects to continue to enter into indemnification agreements with certain executive officers and directors. Further, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date however, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications nor experienced any losses related to them. As of December 31, 2024
 and 2023, the Company was not aware of any claims under indemnification arrangements and does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations. Therefore, no related reserves were established.

12. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity
"At-the-Market" Offering Program
In May 2023, the Company entered into a sales agreement (Sales Agreement) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company (Stifel) with respect to an at-the-market (ATM) offering program under which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time and at the Company’s sole discretion, shares of the Company’s common stock, in an aggregate offering amount of up to $
350.0
 million. 
No
 sales of the Company stock have been made under this arrangement as of 
December 31, 2024.

153

Gilead SPA and Second Gilead SPA
On January 26, 2023, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 
3,478,261
 shares of common stock in a private placement to Gilead at a price of $
28.75
 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $
100.0
 million. The shares were sold pursuant to the Gilead SPA in connection with the Kite Collaboration Agreement and the transaction is considered part of the arrangement. The shares were sold at a discount of $
4.39
 per share as compared to the closing price of the stock on the date of the expiration of anti-trust provisions and accordingly, the $
15.3
 million discount is reflected as an increase to additional paid-in capital and decrease to the total fixed transaction price in the arrangement. See Note 8 - Collaboration Agreement.
On December 28, 2023, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 
3,242,542
 shares of common stock in a private placement to Gilead at a price of $
61.68
 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $
200.0
 million. The shares were sold pursuant to the Second Gilead SPA in connection with the amendment to the Kite Collaboration Agreement and the transaction is considered part of the arrangement. The shares were sold at a premium of $
4.80
 per share as compared to the closing price of the stock on the date of the expiration of anti-trust provisions and accordingly, the $
15.6
 million premium is reflected as an increase to additional paid-in capital and decrease to the total fixed transaction price in the arrangement. See Note 8 - Collaboration Agreement.
Common Stock
Each share of common stock entitles the holder to 
one vote
 on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders. Common stockholders are entitled to receive dividends, as may be declared by the board of directors, if any. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
no
 dividends have been declared or paid by the Company.

In the event of any liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to the assets of the Company legally available for distribution.

Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock

In connection with the Company's IPO on February 4, 2022, all outstanding shares of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into shares of common stock at the applicable conversion ratio then in effect. The Company's outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into 
24,785,564
 shares of common stock. The Company has authorized 
200,000,000
 shares of preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
. There was 
no

13. Share-Based Compensation

The Company’s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) provided for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock awards to the Company's employees, directors, and consultants. The 2017 Plan terminated one business day prior to effectiveness of the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan) with respect to the grant of future awards. The 2022 Plan became effective on February 3, 2022 and provides for the grant of incentive stock options to the Company's employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance awards to the Company's employees, directors, and consultants.
As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to equity awards under the 2022 Plan was 
11,667,993
 shares. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan is cumulatively increased on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the Company’s 2023 fiscal year and ending on the 
ten year
 anniversary of the date the Company’s board of directors approved the 2022 Plan, by an amount equal to the least of (1) 
6,502,174
 shares, (ii) 
5
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) a lesser number of shares determined by the administrator of the 2022 Plan.

Share-based compensation cost is measured at fair value and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 
Share-based compensation expense by type of award was as follows (in thousands):

Restricted Stock Units - Chief Executive Officer
2023 RSU Award
In January 2023, the Company granted 
495,000
 RSUs (the 2023 RSU Award) to its chief executive officer. The 2023 RSU Award has two different scenarios to vesting. The first vesting scenario is subject to service and market conditions. The second vesting scenario adds a performance condition. 
Each RSU granted in the 2023 RSU Award entitles the chief executive officer to one share of common stock upon vesting subject to the service, performance, and market conditions.
 All 
495,000
 RSUs were outstanding and 
no
 RSUs were vested as of 
December 31, 2024. In February 2025, 
347,255
 shares vested based on performance and market conditions achieved on the measurement date of December 31, 2024.

Service Condition
The service condition to vesting of the 2023 RSU Award requires the chief executive officer’s continued employment with the Company through the achievement of any of the performance and market conditions.

Performance Condition
The performance condition to vesting of the 2023 RSU Award requires the consummation of a change in control event.

Market Condition
The market condition to vesting of the 2023 RSU Award involves evaluating Company market value thresholds depending upon which of the 
two
 vesting scenarios is applicable at the time of measurement.

156

The Company market value is measured each June 30 and December 31 subsequent to the grant of the 2023 RSU Award and represents the Company’s Enterprise Value. 
The Company’s Enterprise Value is determined using the total market capitalization of the Company based on the average closing trading price of one share of the Company’s common stock over the 60-day period ending on the day prior to the applicable semi-annual measurement date, less cash. On the semi-annual measurement date, (i) one-sixth of the award will vest if a minimum Enterprise Value of $2.5 billion is achieved, (ii) all of the award will vest if a $5.0 billion Enterprise Value is achieved, and (iii) a portion of the award will vest based on a straight-line interpolation if an Enterprise Value of between $2.5 billion and $5.0 billion is achieved. 
The Company's Enterprise Value on a change in control event is measured on the date of the change in control and represents the aggregate amount of deal consideration paid at the closing of the change in control by an acquirer for the Company’s shares of common stock in connection with such change in control. 
Upon a change in control, (i) one-sixth of the award will vest if a minimum deal consideration of $2.5 billion is achieved, (ii) all of the award will vest if a $5.0 billion deal consideration is achieved, and (iii) a portion of the award will vest based on a straight-line interpolation if a deal consideration of between $2.5 billion and $5.0 billion is achieved.
The Company utilized Monte Carlo simulation models to estimate the fair value of the 2023 RSU Award on the date of grant in each of the two vesting scenarios. The application of the Monte Carlo simulation model to each of the two vesting scenarios requires various subjective assumptions, including the following:

Expected Time to Award End Date
 – The expected time to the award end date is based on the Company’s best estimate of the period of employment for the chief executive officer or the achievement of the performance condition, i.e., the change in control event.

Expected Equity Volatility
 – Due to the limited company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company based its computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to the Company (e.g., public entities of similar size, complexity, stage of development, and industry focus) in addition to the historical volatility of the Company. The historical volatility for the representative group of public companies was calculated based on a period commensurate with the expected time to the award end date.

Risk-Free Interest Rate
 – The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury instrument which term is consistent with the expected time to the measurement dates.

The Company determined the fair value of the 2023 RSU Award using third-party valuation reports. The Company considered several objective and subjective factors, including weighted probability of various scenarios, operating and financial performance, and general and industry-specific economic outlook, among other factors. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlos simulation models to determine the grant date fair value of the 2023 RSU Award for the two vesting scenarios were as follows:

December 31, 2024.

2021 RSU Award
In June 2021, the Company granted 
952,804
 RSUs (the 2021 RSU Award) to its chief executive officer. The 2021 RSU Award is subject to service, performance, and market conditions. In December 2021, the Company added alternative performance conditions for vesting of the same RSUs. These additional performance conditions provided alternative paths to vesting from the 2021 RSU Award; its vesting conditions remained the same, i.e., the original award was not modified.

Each RSU granted in the 2021 RSU Award entitles the chief executive officer to one share of common stock upon vesting subject to the service, performance, and market conditions
. All 
952,804
 RSUs were outstanding and 
no
 RSUs were vested as of 
December 31, 2024. In February 2025, 
668,416
 shares were vested based on performance and market conditions achieved on the measurement date of December 31, 2024.

157

Service Condition
The service condition to vesting of the 2021 RSU Award requires the chief executive officer’s continued employment with the Company through the achievement of any of the performance and the market conditions.

Performance Condition
The performance conditions to vesting of the 2021 RSU Award include (i) the consummation of a change in control event, (ii) the consummation of the first firm commitment underwritten public offering covering the offer and sale of Company shares, the consummation of the direct listing or direct placement of Company shares on a publicly traded exchange, or the completion of a merger or consolidation with a special purpose acquisition company in which the shares of the surviving or parent entity are listed on a national securities exchange (IPO), or (iii) a change in control following an IPO. The Company satisfied the IPO performance condition in February 2022 upon completion of the IPO.

Market Condition
The market condition to vesting of the 2021 RSU Award involves Company value thresholds depending upon which of the vesting scenarios is applicable at the time of measurement.

The Company value is measured each June 30 and December 31 following the IPO (subject to applicable lock-up period) and represents the Company’s Enterprise Value. The methodology to determine the Company’s Enterprise Value and the vesting thresholds on the semi-annual measurement dates are the same as those under the 2023 RSU Award.
The Company value on a change in control is measured on the date of the change in control. The methodology to determine the Company value and the vesting thresholds on the change in control date are the same as those under the 2023 Award.

Upon completion of the IPO in February 2022, the IPO performance condition of the 2021 RSU Award was satisfied and the Company began recognizing share-based compensation expense on an accelerated attribution basis over the 
10-year
 anticipated service period based on a $
10.3
 million aggregate fair value according to the IPO scenario. No other performance condition was deemed probable as of 
December 31, 2024.

The Company utilized Monte Carlo simulation models to estimate the fair value of the 2021 RSU Award on the date of grant in each of the three performance condition scenarios. The application of the Monte Carlo simulation model to each of the three performance condition scenarios requires various subjective assumptions, including the following:

Fair Value of Common Stock and Fair Value of Total Equity
 – Given the lack of an active public market for the common stock (prior to the Company's IPO), the fair value of the Company's common stock and total equity was determined by the board of directors with input from management and consideration of third-party valuation reports. In the absence of a public trading market, and as a clinical-stage company with no significant revenues, the Company believes that it was appropriate to consider a range of factors to determine the fair market value of the common stock at each grant date and resulting total equity value. In determining the fair value of its common stock and total equity value, the Company used methodologies, approaches, and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Series: Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. In addition, the Company considered various objective and subjective factors, along with input from the independent third-party valuation firm. The factors included (1) the achievement of clinical and operational milestones by the Company; (2) the significant risks associated with the Company's stage of development; (3) capital market conditions for life science companies, particularly similarly situated, privately held, early-stage life science companies; (4) the Company's available cash, financial condition, and results of operations; (5) the most recent sales of the Company's redeemable convertible preferred stock; and (6) the preferential rights of the outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Expected Equity Volatility
 – Due to the lack of a public market for the Company's common stock (prior to the Company's IPO) and the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company based its computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to the Company (e.g., public entities of similar size, complexity, stage of development, and industry focus). The historical volatility was calculated based on a period commensurate with the expected date of achievement of a performance condition.

158

Risk-Free Interest Rate and Discount Period
 – The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument which term is consistent with the expected time to achieve of a performance condition. The discount period is the period between the valuation date and the assumed change in control event date, with the assumption that all equity shares in the capital structure are paid out in cash.

Expected Dividend Yield 
– The expected dividend yield is based on the Company's historical and expected dividend payouts. The Company has historically paid no dividends and does not anticipate dividends to be paid in the future.
Expected Time to Achievement of a Performance Condition 
– The time to the achievement of a performance condition is based on the Company's best estimate of the period of time to achievement of a performance condition that attains the established market capitalization thresholds.

The Company determined the fair value of the 2021 RSU Award considering third-party valuation reports. The Company considered several objective and subjective factors, including weighted probability of various liquidation event scenarios, operating and financial performance, discount for lack of marketability of the Company's equity, and general and industry-specific economic outlook, among other factors. The discount for lack of marketability was applied to reflect the increased risk arising from the inability to readily sell the RSUs. 
The assumptions used in the Monte Carlos simulation models to determine the grant date fair value of the 2021 RSU Award for each of the 
three
 performance condition scenarios were as follows:

14.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
In February 2022, the Company adopted the 2022 ESPP, as amended in September 2022. The 2022 ESPP plan was initiated in November 2022 and provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in the Company through periodic payroll deductions, based on a six-month look-back period, at a price equal to the lesser of 
85
% of the fair market value of the common stock at either the first business day or last business day of the relevant offering period, provided that no more than $
25,000
 in common stock may be purchased by any one employee during each year. The 2022 ESPP is intended to constitute an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 2022 ESPP may be terminated by the Company’s board of directors at any time. A total of 
312,500
 shares of common stock were initially re
served for issuance under the 2022 ESPP, subject to an annual increase on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2023, 
equal to the least of 
312,500
 shares of the Company's common stock, 
1
% or the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or such other amount as the administrator under the 2022 ESPP may determine.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESPP plan for the year ending

For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over 
five years
 for research activities performed in the United States and 
15
 years for research activities performed outside the United States pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174.

The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is not more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, management considers (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary difference and carryforwards; (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under applicable tax law; and (iv) tax planning strategies. The Company’s net deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be utilized due to the lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income and cumulative book losses which have resulted over the years. The net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2024 of approximately 
$
45.5
 million
 was primarily due to capitalized research and development expenditures, research and development credits and increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately 
$
2.0
 million
 was primarily due to increase in capitalized research and development expenditures and research and development credits, partially offset by utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.

The Company had federal and State net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately 
$
51.2
 million
 and 
$
74.8
 million
, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The Company also had federal and State research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately 
$
8.9

$
3.2
 million
, respectively, and federal orphan drug credit carryforwards of $
24.8
 million, available to potentially offset future income taxes, as of 
December 31, 2024. The federal NOL will be carried forward indefinitely, if not utilized, but is limited to eighty percent of taxable income. The St
ate NOL will begin expiring in 2038, if not utilized, while a portion is carried forward indefinitely. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards and orphan drug credit carryforwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2042.

Under Section 382/383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which generally occurs if the percentage of the corporation’s stock owned by 
5
% stockholders increases by more than 
50
% over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. The Company performed a Section 382/383 analysis through December 31, 2024. The Company has experienced ownership changes. Some of the Company’s federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will be permanently limited as a result of the ownership change, which have been excluded from the Company’s deferred income tax assets. Subsequent ownership changes may affect the limitation in future years.
