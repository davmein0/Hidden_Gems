Shares repurchased during the three-month period ended December 31, 2024 represent shares withheld to pay taxes due.

In May 2023, Bancorp’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of 1 million shares, or approximately 4% of Bancorp’s total common shares outstanding at the time. Stock repurchases are expected to be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable securities laws. The plan, which will expire in May 2025 unless otherwise extended or completed at an earlier date, does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares prior to the plan’s expiration. No shares were repurchased in 2023, nor in 2024. Approximately 741,000 shares remain eligible for repurchase.

There were no equity securities of the registrant sold without registration during the quarter covered by this report.

On February 18, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per common share.

The following performance graphs and data shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed soliciting material or subject to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

The first graph compares performance of Bancorp’s Common Stock to the Russell 2000 Index, the S&P U.S. BMI Banks – Midwest Region Index and the KBW NASDAQ Bank Index for the last five fiscal years. The graph assumes the value of the investment in Bancorp’s Common Stock and in each index was $100 at December 31, 2019 and that all dividends were reinvested.

In addition to the five-year period presented, the ten-year period is presented because it provides additional perspective, and Bancorp management believes that longer-term performance is of interest. The ten-year graph assumes the value of the investment in Bancorp’s Common Stock and in each respective index was $100 at December 31, 2014 and that all dividends were reinvested.

Management
’
s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. (“Bancorp” or “the Company”), is a FHC headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky and is engaged in the business of banking through its wholly owned subsidiary, Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company (“SYB” or “the Bank”). Bancorp, which was incorporated in 1988 in Kentucky, is registered with, and subject to supervision, regulation and examination by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As Bancorp has no significant operations of its own, its business and the business of SYB are essentially the same. The operations of SYB are fully reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Bancorp. Accordingly, references to “Bancorp” in this document may encompass both the holding company and the Bank. All significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

SYB, established in 1904, is a state-chartered non-member financial institution that provides services in Louisville, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio markets through 72 full service banking center locations. The Bank is registered with, and subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the FDIC and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions.

As a result of its acquisition of Commonwealth Bancshares, Inc. on March 7, 2022, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of three unconsolidated Delaware trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings exchanged for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS.

As a result of its acquisition of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. on May 31, 2021, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of a Nevada-based insurance captive taxed under Section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. On April 10, 2023, the IRS issued a proposed regulation that would potentially classify section 831(b) captive activity as a, “listed transaction,” and possibly disallow the related tax benefits, both prospectively and retroactively. The regulation was finalized in January 2025 and its impact is being evaluated by management. Bancorp elected not to renew the Captive in August of 2023 and ultimately dissolved the Captive in December of 2023. The Captive’s activity is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and was included in its 2023 federal income tax return. The Captive’s activity served to reduce Bancorp’s ETR by 0.20% and 0.29% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Also as a result of its acquisition of Commonwealth Bancshares, Inc., Bancorp acquired a 60% interest in LFA, a Bowling Green, Kentucky-based wealth management services company. Effective December 31, 2022, Bancorp’s partial interest in LFA was sold, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $870,000 recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated income statements for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. This acquired line of business was not within the Company’s geographic footprint and ultimately did not align with the Company’s long-term strategic model. Net income related to LFA and attributable to Bancorp’s 60% interest, excluding the pre-tax loss on disposition noted above, totaled $483,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes presented in Part II Item 8 “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
.” To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which may not be indicative of Bancorp’s future financial outcomes.

 Issued but Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards Updates

For disclosure regarding the impact to Bancorp’s financial statements of issued-but-not-yet-effective ASUs, see the footnote titled “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
” of Part II Item 8 “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
.”

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods.

Management continually evaluates its accounting policies and estimates that it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, management’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, accounting and regulatory guidance, and information obtained from independent third-party professionals. Actual results may differ from those estimates made by management.

Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of Bancorp’s financial condition and operating results and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective and complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the financial statements. These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates have a significant impact on the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including independent third parties or available pricing, sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative methods of accounting may be utilized under GAAP. Management has discussed each critical accounting policy and the methodology for the identification and determination of critical accounting policies with Bancorp’s Audit Committee. As of December 31, 2024, the significant accounting policy considered the most critical in preparing Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements is the determination of the ACL on loans.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Provision for Credit Losses 

For purposes of establishing the general reserve of the ACL, Bancorp stratifies the loan portfolio into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics and calculates the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the loans to estimate the credit losses in the loan portfolio. Bancorp’s methodologies for estimating the ACL on loans consider available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

The ACL on loans is established through credit loss expense charged to current earnings. The amount maintained in the ACL reflects management’s estimate of the net amount not expected to be collected on the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date over the life of the loan. The ACL is comprised of specific reserves assigned to certain loans that do not share general risk characteristics and general reserves on pools of loans that do share general risk characteristics. Factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the creditworthiness of the borrower and more specifically, changes in the expected future receipt of principal and interest payments and/or in the value of pledged collateral. A reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan’s initial effective interest rate, an expected loss ratio based on historical losses adjusted as appropriate for qualitative factors, or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans.

Provision for credit losses can be subject to volatility as ACL calculations and the resulting expense are significantly impacted by changes in CECL model assumptions, such as macroeconomic factors and conditions, credit quality and loan portfolio composition and growth.

General highlights for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023:

●

In 2024, Bancorp set the following financial 
records
:

o

Net income of $114.5 million, and as a result, diluted EPS of $3.89, besting the previous records of $107.7 million and diluted EPS of $3.67 from 2023.

o

Total revenue, comprising net interest income (FTE) and non-interest income, of $352.6 million, surpassing the previous record of $340.1 million in 2023.

o

Strong loan production drove $749 million, or 13%, of loan growth, leading to record total loans of $6.52 billion at December 31, 2024.

o

WM&T revenue of $42.8 million, driven by strong equity market appreciation and higher estate fee income and served to offset a net new business decline.

o

Debit and credit card income of $20.1 million, consistent with higher transaction volume, growth in the customer base and larger processor incentives.

o

Treasury management fee income of $11.1 million, consistent with customer base expansion, increased transaction volume, record international services fee income and new product sales.

o

Net investment product sales commissions and fee income of $3.6 million stemming from organic growth and general market appreciation.

●

Net income totaled $114.5 million for year ended December 31, 2024, resulting in diluted EPS of $3.89, compared to net income of $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which resulted in diluted EPS of $3.67.

o

Record results for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year were driven by significant organic loan growth, a higher interest rate environment and the continued growth of Bancorp’s diversified non-interest revenue streams.

o

While interest income benefitted from higher interest rates in 2024, an increase in the cost of funds stemming from intense deposit competition/pricing pressure, as well as increased borrowing activity, had a substantial impact on results for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year.

32

Table of Contents

●

While NIM decreased 8 bps to 3.31% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 3.39% for the prior year, net interest income (FTE) increased $9.5 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, reaching a record $257.4 million.

o

Interest income experienced a $66.0 million, or 19%, increase over the prior year associated with the benefits of higher yields and average earning asset growth, outpacing the $56.5 million, or 57%, increase in interest expense driven by the rising cost of funds and growth in interest-bearing liabilities.

o

As a result of deposit pricing pressure/competition, Bancorp has continued to experience a significant shift in the deposit mix, as non-interest bearing deposits and lower-yielding deposits have migrated to higher-yielding options, particularly time deposits, driving a substantial increase in the overall cost of deposits. Further, continued loan growth and deposit balance fluctuations necessitated more borrowing activity in 2024 compared to the prior year, contributing to the overall increase in interest expense.

o

Yields on interest earning assets increased 56 bps, or 12%, to 5.31% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 4.75% for the prior year. However, these yields were outpaced by the cost of interest bearing liabilities, which expanded 76 bps, or 39%, to 2.73% compared to 1.97% for the prior year, driving net interest spread and NIM compression.

●

Total loans increased $749 million, or 13%, compared to December 31, 2023, driven by growth in most categories over the past year. Average loans increased $663 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year.

●

Bancorp’s ACL on loans increased $8 million, or 10%, compared to December 31, 2023. Provision for credit losses on loans totaled $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $12.5 million for the prior year.

o

Provision for the year ended December 31, 2024 was attributed mainly to substantial loan growth and to a lesser extent, an improved unemployment forecast and other factors within the CECL model. Further, net charge offs of $1.2 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024.

o

Provision for credit losses on loans for the prior year period were driven by substantial loan growth, a flat unemployment forecast and other factors within the CECL model. Bancorp also recorded net charge offs of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by the charge off of two isolated and unrelated C&I relationships.

●

Total deposits increased $496 million, or 7%, at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. While total deposit growth was experienced compared to the prior year, a continued shift in the deposit base mix was also experienced, as pricing pressure/competition for deposits remained strong during the year.

o

Interest-bearing deposits increased $588 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, led in part by a $255 million, or 26%, increase in time deposits associated with Bancorp’s successful promotional product offerings, offsetting a $92 million, or 6%, decline in non-interest bearing deposits.

●

Non-interest income increased $3.0 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, attributed largely to strong WM&T revenue, treasury management fees and card income.

●

Non-interest expenses increased $10.4 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, driven by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses associated with annual merit-based salary increases and higher bonus levels, full-time employee growth and higher health insurance claims activity, in addition to increased technology and communication expense, attributed to various security and compliance-related software upgrades.

●

Bancorp’s efficiency ratio (FTE) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 56.20% compared to 55.23% for the prior year. The increase in this ratio was the result of non-interest expense growth (on a percentage basis) outpacing net interest income and non-interest income expansion, as net interest income was hampered by rising funding costs. See the section titled “
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” for a reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.

Total stockholder’s equity to total assets was 10.61% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 10.50% at December 31, 2023. Total equity increased to $940 million in 2024, driven by net income of $114.5 million and a small improvement in AOCI, offset partially by $36 million of dividends declared. The small improvement in AOCI from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was the result of the changing interest rate environment and its corresponding impact on the valuation of the AFS debt securities portfolio. Further, a $2.5 million increase in retained earnings was recorded in relation to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2024.

TCE is a measure of a company’s capital, which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Bancorp’s ratio of TCE to total tangible assets was 8.44% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 8.09% at December 31, 2023, the improvement driven mainly by growth in stockholder’s equity associated with the year’s strong operating results and to a much smaller extent, the positive change in AOCI related to the valuation of the AFS debt securities portfolio. See the section titled “
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” for reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.

Table of Contents

General highlights for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022:

●

In 2023, Bancorp set the following financial 
records
:

o

Net income of $107.7 million, and as a result, diluted EPS of $3.67, besting the previous records of $93.0 million and diluted EPS of $3.21 from 2022.

o

Total revenue, comprising net interest income (FTE) and non-interest income, of $340.1 million, surpassing the previous record of $323.4 million in 2022.

o

Record loan production, which drove $565 million, or 11%, of organic loan growth, leading to record total loans of $5.77 billion at December 31, 2023.

o

WM&T revenue of $39.8 million, which was driven by solid net new business growth and strong fourth quarter performance within the equity and fixed income markets.

o

Debit and credit card income of $19.4 million, consistent with organic and acquisition-related growth in transaction volume and customer base, in addition to larger processor incentives.

o

Treasury management fee income of $10.0 million, led by strong transaction volume, organic and acquisition-related expansion of the customer base, new product sales and expanded international revenue.

o

Net investment product sales commissions and fee income of $3.2 million stemming from organic growth and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity.

●

Net income totaled $107.7 million for year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in diluted EPS of $3.67, compared to net income of $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which resulted in diluted EPS of $3.21. The year ended December 31, 2022 was significantly impacted by the CB acquisition.

o

Record results for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year were driven by significant organic growth, the full year impact of acquisition-related activity, the benefit to interest income of rising interest rates compared to the prior year and the continued growth of Bancorp’s diversified non-interest revenue streams.

o

While interest income benefitted from rising interest rates in 2023, an increase in the cost of funds stemming from deposit contraction and pricing pressure, as well as increased borrowing activity, had a substantial impact on results for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.

o

Bancorp completed its acquisition of CB on March 7, 2022. At the time of acquisition and net of purchase accounting adjustments, CB had approximately $1.34 billion in total assets, $632 million in loans, $247 million in investment securities and $1.12 billion in deposits. The year ended December 31, 2022 represented approximately 10 months of activity associated with the CB acquisition, including $19.5 million in merger expenses and $4.4 million in credit loss expense attributed to the acquired loan portfolio, which weighed heavily on prior year results.

●

NIM increased 4 bps to 3.39% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 3.35% for the prior year, consistent with average balance sheet expansion and upward movement in interest rates experienced during the year. Net interest income (FTE) totaled $247.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of $13.6 million, or 6%, over the prior year.

o

Despite increased net interest income and NIM, net interest spread declined 43 bps to 2.78% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. Rising deposit costs and increased borrowing activity drove a substantial increase in the cost of funds, which increased 157 bps to 1.97% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 0.40% for the prior year.

●

Total loans increased $565 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, with notable growth in CRE and Residential real estate being driven by a year of record loan production.

●

Bancorp’s ACL on loans increased $6 million, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2022. Provision for credit losses on loans totaled $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $9.7 million for the prior year.

o

In addition to substantial loan growth, a flat unemployment forecast and other factors within the CECL model, Bancorp also recorded net charge offs of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by the charge off of two isolated and unrelated C&I relationships.

o

Provision for credit losses on loans for the prior year period included $4.4 million of expense related to the acquired loan portfolio, and to a lesser extent, a deteriorating economic forecast.

●

Total deposits increased $279 million, or 4%, at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. While total deposit growth was experienced compared to the prior year, there was significant shift in the deposit base mix, as customers migrated from non-interest bearing products into higher-yielding alternatives and pricing pressure related to deposits intensified during the year.

o

Interest-bearing deposits increased $681 million, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, led by a $511 million increase in time deposits associated with Bancorp’s successful promotional product offerings, offsetting a $402 million, or 21%, decline in non-interest bearing deposits.

●

Non-interest income increased $3.1 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. While virtually all traditional non-interest income revenue streams experienced significant increases over the year ended December 31, 2022, the prior year benefitted from non-recurring gains totaling $4.4 million associated with the sale of acquired properties.

●

Non-interest expenses decreased $4.0 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. Non-interest expenses in general remained well-controlled and consistent with expansion, strong performance and continued investment in technology. The prior year included $19.5 million of merger expenses associated with the CB acquisition.

●

Bancorp’s efficiency ratio (FTE) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 55.23% compared to 59.30% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The elevated ratio for the prior year was the result of one-time merger-related expenses recorded in relation to the CB acquisition. Bancorp also considers an adjusted efficiency ratio, which eliminates net gains (losses) on sales and calls of investment securities, as well as net gains (losses) on sales of acquired premises and equipment and disposition of any acquired assets, if applicable, and the fluctuation in non-interest expenses related to amortization of investments in tax credit partnerships and non-recurring merger expenses. Bancorp’s adjusted efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 54.84% compared to 53.61% for the year ended December 31, 2022. See the section titled “
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” for a reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.

Total stockholder’s equity to total assets was 10.50% as of December 31, 2023 compared to 10.14% at December 31, 2022. Total equity increased to $858 million in 2023, driven by net income of $107.7 million and a $23 million positive change in AOCI, offset partially by $35 million of dividends declared. The increase in AOCI from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was the result of the changing interest rate environment and its corresponding impact on the valuation of the AFS debt securities portfolio.

Potential Challenges for 2025:

We have identified the following potential challenges for fiscal year 2025:

●

Pricing pressure and competition for both loans and deposits will continue to present challenges in 2025, driven by uncertainty within the current interest rate environment, a flattened/inverted yield curve and overall liquidity management.

o

While the higher rate environment experienced in 2024 led to higher yields for the loan portfolio and other earning assets, it also resulted in higher funding costs. Depositors continued migrating from non-interest bearing or lower-yielding deposits to higher-yielding alternatives. Further, substantial loan growth and deposit fluctuations resulted in increased borrowing activity, which drove funding costs higher.

o

During 2024, the yield curve started to flatten after a prolonged period of inversion. Inverted and/or flattened yield curves create a general pricing mismatch between the rates earned on longer-term loans and investments and the rates paid on shorter-term deposits and borrowings, which generally results in NIM compression. While Bancorp began to experience NIM expansion in the second half of the year after several quarters of compression, to the extent the yield curve remains flat or battles inversion, NIM growth could be challenged in 2025.

o

Successfully funding loan growth will require us to manage liquidity in a cost-effective manner and could depend largely on our ability to raise and maintain deposits, which will present challenges in the current environment. While other sources of funding are available, they are typically more expensive than in-market deposit relationships and the extent to which they are utilized could increase our overall funding costs.

●

Continued monetary policy changes by the FRB and the corresponding impact on local, national and global economic conditions could present numerous challenges in 2025. While recent projections indicate that the FRB will slow or halt interest rate reductions in 2025, the timing and magnitude of any future policy changes could have a significant impact on results in the coming year.

●

While the economic outlook for 2025 is generally positive, expectations are regularly changing as new economic data becomes available. Further, a new presidential administration creates additional uncertainties, although many of the anticipated policy changes are expected to be fiscally expansionary. The resulting impact of new policies, or policy changes, implemented by the new administration, especially those concerning fiscal and tax policy, could affect general economic conditions, our business and that of our customers.

●

Net loan growth will remain a top priority for us in 2025. This will be impacted by competition, prevailing interest rates, economic conditions, line of credit utilization and loan prepayments. We believe there is continued opportunity for loan growth in all of our markets. Our ability to deliver attractive loan growth over the long-term is critical to our overall success.

●

The continued development of the relationships and opportunities in our newer markets remains a priority for 2025. The Company’s growing footprint has allowed us to provide broader product offerings, increased lending capabilities and an expanded branch delivery system to existing and prospective customers alike, creating solid growth opportunities and a larger platform for future expansion. Prioritizing the development of the opportunities afforded by recent acquisitions will play a major role in delivering strong operating results in the coming year.

●

We derive significant non-interest income from WM&T services. Most of these fees are based upon the market value of AUM at respective period ends. Absent fixed income and equity market movements, growing this revenue stream may prove challenging, as competition to attract new customers and retain existing customers remains intense. Growth in market values of AUM and fees is dependent upon positive returns in the overall capital markets, which could be threatened should economic conditions worsen. We have no control over market volatility.

●

We have experienced substantial increases in other non-interest income revenue streams over the past several years, such as treasury management fees, card income and brokerage services. A meaningful portion of this growth can be attributed to the customer bases acquired in recent years, as well as our exposure to newer markets. To the extent we have already successfully capitalized on the related opportunities, the growth experienced recently may trend back to more normal levels. Continuing to successfully grow our diversified non-interest revenue streams will be critical to our success in 2025.

●

Over the past several years, our asset quality metrics have trended within a relatively low range, periodically exceeding benchmarks and reaching historically strong levels. We realize that current asset quality metrics remain solid and, recognizing the cyclical nature of the lending business and current economic conditions, we anticipate this trend will likely normalize over time.

Net Interest Income - Overview

As is the case with most banks, Bancorp’s primary revenue sources are net interest income and fee income from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and rates paid on deposits directly impact profitability. New business volume is influenced by numerous economic factors including market interest rates, business spending, liquidity, consumer confidence and various competitive conditions within the marketplace. The discussion that follows is based on FTE net interest income data.

Interest income, yields and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides insight into net interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess to comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal corporate income tax rate of 21%.

Comparative information regarding net interest income follows:

*See table titled, "Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (FTE)" for detail of Net interest income (FTE).

NIM and net interest spread calculations in the preceding table exclude the sold portion of certain participation loans, which totaled $2 million, $4 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These sold loans are on Bancorp’s balance sheet as required by GAAP because Bancorp retains some form of effective control; however, Bancorp receives no interest income on the sold portion. These participation loans sold are excluded from NIM and spread analysis, because Bancorp believes it provides a more accurate depiction of loan portfolio performance.

At December 31, 2024, Bancorp’s loan portfolio consisted of approximately 67% fixed and 33% variable rate loans. At inception, most of Bancorp’s fixed rate loans are priced in relation to the five year treasury note. Bancorp’s variable rate loans are typically indexed to either Prime or one month term SOFR, generally repricing as those rates change. At December 31, 2024, approximately 59% and 41% of Bancorp’s variable rate loan portfolio was indexed to Prime and SOFR, respectively.

Prime rate, the five year Treasury note rate, and one month term SOFR are included in the preceding table to provide a general indication of the interest rate environment Bancorp has operated in during the past three years, a period marked by dramatic changes in interest rates. In March 2022, the FRB began a rate hike strategy aimed at taming inflation, which had reached its highest levels in decades, and exiting the near-zero interest rate environment of the pandemic era. This resulted in the FFTR being increased a total of 525 basis points in just under a year and a half, taking it from a range of 0.00% - 0.25% to a range of 5.25% - 5.50% by July 2023. Prime increased from 3.25% to 8.50% over this same period.

37

Table of Contents

Interest rates remained at these levels until September 2024, when the FRB implemented its first rate reduction in over four years, beginning its attempt to avoid recession and pilot a “soft landing,” with three separate decreases of the FFTR over the final four months of year, ultimately lowering the FFTR a total of 100 bps. The FFTR stood at a range of 4.25% - 4.50%, and Prime at 7.50%, as of December 31, 2024.

Bancorp experienced significant benefit from the rate increases enacted in 2022, as the majority of Bancorp’s variable rate loans rose above their 4.00% floors and deposit rates remained relatively low. However, as interest rates continued to rise in 2023, the positive impact rising rates had on the loan portfolio began to be offset by higher deposit rates stemming from intense pricing pressure and competition, which began to drive NIM compression. While this trend continued into 2024, significant average loan growth and the benefit of higher rates upon average interest earning assets eventually managed to outpace rising funding costs in the latter half of the year, as deposit cost expansion began to moderate.

While recent projections indicate that the FRB will slow or halt interest rate reductions in 2025, Bancorp expects ongoing pricing pressure/competition for both loans and deposits and general liquidity management to be the primary challenges to NIM and net interest income growth in 2025.

Discussion of 2024 vs 2023:

Net interest spread (FTE) and NIM (FTE) were 2.58% and 3.31%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2.78% and 3.39% for the prior year, respectively. NIM during the year ended December 31, 2024 was significantly impacted by the following:

●

The higher interest rate environment that has served to benefit interest-earning assets simultaneously drove NIM compression, as the cost of deposits and other funding sources rose. While the FFTR was reduced a total of 100 bps to a range of 4.25% - 4.50% over the last 4 months of 2024, it had previously remained at a range of 5.25% - 5.50% since mid-2023, resulting in an inverted interest rate yield curve for an extended period of time. Although it improved some during the year, it remains to be seen how FRB rate actions will impact the interest rate yield curve in 2025.

●

Pricing pressure/competition for deposits drove a significant increase in the cost of funds and shift in Bancorp’s deposit mix, as depositors sought higher yielding deposit alternatives. While expansion of the cost of funding has moderated in tandem with interest rate decreases, lower liquidity levels within the banking industry generally may continue to drive pricing pressure/competition for deposits.

●

Significant loan growth over the past 12 months has positively impacted interest income and average interest-earning asset growth, which Bancorp elected to fund with deposit and non-deposit sources, namely scheduled investment security maturities and FHLB borrowings.

Net interest income (FTE) increased $9.5 million, or 4%, for the year December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, as significant average loan growth and the benefit of higher yields upon average interest earning assets managed to outpace rising funding costs stemming from intense pricing pressure/competition for deposits and increased borrowing activity.

Total average interest earning assets increased $475 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, attributed to substantial average loan growth that was partially offset by a decline in average investment securities associated with scheduled maturities and normal amortization. As a result of a higher interest rate environment, the average rate earned on total interest earning assets climbed 56 bps to 5.31%.

●

Average total loan balances increased $663 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, driven by contributions from every loan category and every market.

●

Average investment securities declined $205 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, mainly the result of significant scheduled maturities within the treasury portfolio, and to a lesser extent, normal amortization activity. This activity has benefitted interest-earning asset yields and overall NIM, as the low-yielding treasury security maturities shifted into higher-yielding interest-bearing cash and ultimately helped fund Bancorp’s substantial loan growth.

38

Table of Contents

●

Average FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances increased $14 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a result of the previously mentioned liquidity provided by the investment securities portfolio and increased FHLB borrowing activity, which was partially offset by loan funding.

Total interest income (FTE) increased $66.0 million, or 19%, to $413.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year.

●

Interest and fee income (FTE) on loans increased $67.2 million, or 22%, to $369.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, driven by the higher rate environment and significant average loan growth. The yield on the overall loan portfolio increased 49 bps to 6.07% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 5.58% for the prior year.

●

Consistent with the decline in average investment securities, there was a $2.8 million, or 8%, decrease in interest income (FTE) on the portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. The corresponding yield on the portfolio increased 10 bps, or 5%, to 2.15% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2.05% for the prior year, due to the maturity of lower-yielding treasury securities.

●

Interest income on FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances increased $845,000, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, stemming mainly from the higher FFTR experienced for most of the year. The yield on these assets increased 7 bps to 5.19% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year.

Total average interest bearing liabilities increased $660 million, or 13%, to $5.71 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year.

●

Average interest bearing deposits increased $545 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to prior year. Bancorp experienced a $358 million, or 49%, increase in average time deposits and a $144 million, or 13%, increase in average money market deposits compared to the prior year period, as a result of depositors seeking higher-yielding deposit products in the higher rate environment.

●

Average FHLB advances increased $89 million, or 32%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. In an effort to secure longer-term funding at a more favorable rate, Bancorp began utilizing a $200 million term advance in conjunction with three separate interest rate swaps of varying maturities during 2023. An additional interest rate swap was added during 2024 for the same purpose, bringing the total related advances to $300 million as of December 31, 2024. Bancorp also utilized overnight borrowings more heavily in 2024 to fund loan growth and manage deposit fluctuations.

●

Average SSUAR increased $31 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, as customers were attracted to the collateralized protection provided by this product.

Total interest expense increased $56.5 million, or 57%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, driven by a significant rise in rates paid on deposits and increased borrowing activity. As a result, the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 76 bps to 2.73% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year.

●

Total interest bearing deposit expense increased $52.0 million, or 64%, as a result of deposit rate increases, $38.3 million of which was attributed to time deposit and money market deposits, as customers continued to shift to higher-yielding deposit products. This activity resulted in an 82 bps increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year. While Bancorp expects pricing pressure/competition to continue into the coming quarters, the pace of deposit cost expansion began to moderate in the second half of 2024.

●

Interest expense on FHLB borrowings increased $3.7 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, driven by both increased borrowing activity and higher costs associated with overnight borrowings.

●

Interest expense on SSUAR increased $1.3 million, or 64%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, consistent with average balance growth and rising rates.

Discussion of 2023 vs 2022:

Net interest spread (FTE) and NIM (FTE) were 2.78% and 3.39%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 3.21% and 3.35% for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. NIM during the year ended December 31, 2023 was significantly impacted by the following:

●

The rapidly rising interest rate environment that has evolved from the sustained, pandemic-driven lows experienced beginning in 2020. The FFTR was lowered to a range of 0% - 0.25% in March of 2020, which resulted in Prime dropping to 3.25%, where it remained until the FRB’s first hike in mid-March 2022. The FFTR stood at a range of 5.25% - 5.50%, and Prime at 8.50%, as of December 31, 2023, as a result of aggressive interest rate action from the FRB during 2022 and 2023.

●

The positive impact of rising interest rates on interest-earning assets, which drove a substantial increase in interest income across all interest-earning asset categories.

●

A significant increase in the cost of funds, as depositors migrated to higher yielding deposit alternatives, competition for deposits intensified and Bancorp’s borrowing activity increased, which partially offset the growth of yields on interest-earning assets noted above.

●

Balance sheet expansion stemming from both organic growth and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.

Net interest income (FTE) increased $13.6 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, attributed largely to significant organic loan growth, the full year impact of acquisition-related activity and the benefits of a rising interest rate environment, which more than offset rising funding costs.

Total average interest earning assets increased $316 million, or 5%, to $7.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to year ended December 31, 2022, with the average rate earned on total interest earning assets increasing 114 bps to 4.75%.

●

Average total loan balances increased $604 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year. Average non-PPP loan growth of $648 million, or 14%, was driven by strong organic growth and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity, which was partially offset by a $44 million, or 83%, decline in average PPP loan balances resulting from SBA forgiveness activity.

●

Average investment securities grew $17 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, attributed to a combination of strategically deploying excess liquidity through further investment and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity, which was partially offset by normal amortization and maturity activity. Investment security purchases during 2023 were minimal.

●

Average FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances decreased $313 million, or 66%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as loan growth and average total deposit contraction led to lower levels of liquidity compared to the prior year.

Total interest income (FTE) increased $94.7 million, or 37%, to $347.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

●

Interest and fee income (FTE) on loans increased $85.7 million, or 40%, to $302.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year, driven by the rising rate environment and both organic and acquisition-related growth, which more than offset a $4.6 million, or 95%, decline in PPP-related income. The yield on the overall loan portfolio increased 108 bps to 5.58% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4.50% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

●

Growth in average investment securities led to a $5.5 million, or 19%, increase in interest income (FTE) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, driving a 30 bps, or 17%, increase in the corresponding yield on the investment portfolio. The increased yield on the investment securities portfolio was driven by the benefit of investments purchased in the prior year once rates began to rise and the continued amortization and maturity of lower-yielding securities.

Table of Contents

●

Interest income on FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances increased $2.4 million, or 40%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as rising short-term interest rates more than offset a $313 million decline in related average balances. The yield on these assets increased 386 bps to 5.12% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, stemming from the dramatic increase in the FFTR over the preceding year.

Total average interest bearing liabilities increased $513.2 million, or 11%, to $5.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, with the total average cost increasing 157 bps to 1.97%.

●

Average interest bearing deposits increased $223 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The increase stemmed mainly from an increase in time deposits during 2023 attributed to general customer migration to higher-yielding deposit alternatives and Bancorp’s promotional offerings, which has been partially offset by contraction in other interest bearing deposit categories.

●

Average FHLB advances totaled $280 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Bancorp utilized overnight borrowings during 2023 based on changing liquidity needs. Bancorp also utilized rolling term advances in conjunction with three separate interest rate swaps during the year ended December 31, 2023 in an effort to secure longer-term funding at a more favorable rate. The minimal FHLB advance activity that occurred in the prior year was the result of utilizing a one-week cash management advance at year-end for short-term liquidity purposes, which represented the only FHLB advance used during 2022.

●

Average subordinated debentures totaled $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The subordinated debentures were added as a result of the CB acquisition during the first quarter of 2022.

Total interest expense increased $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by substantial deposit rate increases and increased borrowing activity, and to a lesser extent, acquisition-related expansion. As a result, the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 157 bps to 1.97% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.

●

Total interest bearing deposit expense increased $65.2 million, mainly as a result aforementioned deposit rate increases, resulting in a 140 bps increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.

●

Interest expense of $12.8 million was recorded in relation to FHLB borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by the increased borrowing activity previously noted. Interest expense of $12,000 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022, which stemmed entirely from a one-week cash management advance utilized at year-end.

Supplemental Information - Total Company Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (FTE)

●

Average loan balances include the principal balance of non-accrual loans, as well as unearned income such as loan premiums, discounts, fees/costs and exclude participation loans accounted for as secured borrowings. Participation loans averaged $3 million, $4 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

●

Interest income on a FTE basis includes additional amounts of interest income that would have been earned if investments in certain tax-exempt interest earning assets had been made in assets subject to federal taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Interest income on municipal securities and tax-exempt loans has been calculated on a FTE basis using a federal income tax rate of 21%. Approximate tax equivalent adjustments to interest income were $360,000, $537,000 and $884,000 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

●

Interest income includes loan fees of $6.3 million ($35,000 associated with the PPP), $5.2 million ($242,000 associated with the PPP) and $10.3 million ($4.2 million associated with the PPP) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest income on loans may be impacted by the level of prepayment fees collected and net accretion income related to loans purchased. Net accretion income/ (amortization expense) related to acquired loans totaled $2.2 million, $2.4 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

●

Net interest income, the most significant component of Bancorp's earnings, represents total interest income less total interest expense. The level of net interest income is determined by mix and volume of interest earning assets, interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds, and changes in interest rates. 

●

NIM represents net interest income on a FTE basis as a percentage of average interest earning assets. 

●

Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference between taxable equivalent rates earned on interest earning assets less the cost of interest bearing liabilities.

●

The fair market value adjustment on investment securities resulting from ASC 320, Investments 
–
 Debt and Equity Securities is included as a component of other assets.

Table of Contents

The following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impacted Bancorp’s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume) and (iii) net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. Tax-equivalent adjustments are based on a federal income tax rate of 21%. The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the change due to rate and the change due to volume in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.

Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk

Managing interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. The primary objective of interest rate risk management is to neutralize effects of interest rate changes on net income. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity with the goal of optimizing net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements.

Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis 

Bancorp uses an earnings simulation model to estimate and evaluate the impact of an immediate change in interest rates on earnings in a one-year forecast. The simulation model is designed to reflect dynamics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. By estimating effects of interest rate fluctuations, the model can approximate interest rate risk exposure. This simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and may not indicate actual or expected results.

The results of the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed as of December 31, 2024 were derived from conservative assumptions Bancorp uses in its model, particularly in relation to deposit betas, which measure how responsive management’s deposit repricing may be to changes in market rates based on historical data. Management uses different betas in the rising and falling rate scenarios in an effort to best simulate expected earnings trends.

Bancorp’s interest rate sensitivity analysis details that increases in interest rates of 100 and 200 bps would have a positive effect on net interest income, while decreases in interest rates of 100 and 200 bps would have a negative impact. These results depict a slightly asset-sensitive interest rate risk profile. The increase in net interest income in the rising rate scenarios is primarily due to variable rate loans and short-term investments repricing more quickly than deposits and short-term borrowings. Net interest income decreases in the falling rate scenarios because rates on non-maturity deposits cannot be lowered sufficiently to offset the decline in interest income associated with assets that immediately reprice as rates fall.

Bancorp’s loan portfolio is currently composed of approximately 67% fixed and 33% variable rate loans, with the fixed rate portion pricing generally based on a spread to the five year treasury note at the time of origination and the variable portion pricing based on an on-going spread to Prime (approximately 60%) or one month term SOFR (approximately 40%).

Periodically, Bancorp enters into interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated derivative instruments and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in other non-interest income as interest rates fluctuate. Because of matching terms of offsetting contracts, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, changes in fair value subsequent to initial recognition have a minimal effect on earnings and are therefore not included in the simulation analysis results above. For additional information see the footnote titled “
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value.
”

In addition, Bancorp periodically uses derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate risk management, including interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as described in the footnote titled “
Derivative Financial Instruments.
” For these derivatives, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in periods in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Provision for Credit Losses

Provision for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2024 represents the amount of expense that, based on Management’s judgment, is required to maintain the ACL for loans at an appropriate level under the CECL model. The determination of the amount of the ACL for loans is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. See the footnote titled “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
” for detailed discussion regarding Bancorp’s ACL methodology by loan segment.

An analysis of the changes in the ACL on loans, including provision, and selected ratios follow:

Discussion of 2024 vs 2023:

The ACL for loans totaled $87 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $79 million at December 31, 2023, representing an ACL to total loans ratio of 1.33% and 1.38% for the respective periods.

Provision expense for credit losses on loans of $8.8 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was driven mainly by strong loan growth, net charge offs of $1.2 million, and to a much lesser extent, an improved unemployment forecast and other factors within the CECL model.

Provision expense for credit losses on loans of $12.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to strong loan growth, a flat unemployment forecast and other factors within the CECL allowance model, provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was impacted significantly by net charge offs of $6.6 million. Net charge off activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 was attributed mainly to the charge off of two isolated and unrelated C&I relationships, one of which was fully reserved for in a prior period.

While separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, the ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures also experienced an increase between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. Provision expense of $925,000 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven largely by an increase in expected future utilization within the C&D portfolio. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures totaled $6.8 million as of December 31, 2024.

46

Table of Contents

Provision for credit loss expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $1.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven largely by the addition of new C&D and C&I lines of credit. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures totaled $5.9 million as of December 31, 2023.

Bancorp’s loan portfolio is well-diversified with no significant concentrations of credit. Geographically, most loans are extended to borrowers in Louisville, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan markets. The adequacy of the ACL is monitored on an ongoing basis and it is the opinion of management that the balance of the ACL at December 31, 2024 is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the financial statement date.

Discussion of 2023 vs 2022:

The ACL for loans totaled $79 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $74 million at December 31, 2022, representing an ACL to total loans ratio of 1.38% and 1.41% for those periods, respectively. Based on the 100% SBA guarantee of the PPP loan portfolio, which totaled $4 million at December 31, 2023 and $19 million at December 31, 2022, Bancorp did not reserve for potential losses for these loans within the ACL.

Provision expense for credit losses on loans of $12.5 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to strong loan growth, a flat unemployment forecast and other factors within the CECL allowance model, provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was driven by net charge offs $6.6 million. Elevated net charge off activity for the year ended December 31, 2023 was attributed mainly to the charge off of two isolated and unrelated C&I relationships, one of which was fully reserved for in a prior period.

Provision expense (excluding acquisition-related activity) of $5.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. Significant loan growth, inflation and recession-based increases in the projected unemployment rate forecast, along with qualitative factor updates related to the potential impact of rising rates on the C&I portfolio, were the main drivers of expense within the CECL model for 2022. Further, net charge off/recovery activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 was minimal.

Credit loss expense recorded for the acquired CB loan portfolio totaled $4.4 million in 2022, bringing total provision for credit losses on loans to $9.7 million for the year. Further, the ACL for loans was also increased $10 million as a result of the PCD loan portfolio added through the CB acquisition during the first quarter of 2022, with the corresponding offset recorded to goodwill (as opposed to provision expense).

The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures also increased between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. Provision for credit loss expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $1.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven largely by the addition of new C&D and C&I lines of credit. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures totaled $5.9 million as of December 31, 2023.

Provision for credit loss expense for off balance sheet credit exposures (excluding acquisition-related activity) of $575,000 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven largely by the addition of new lines of credit, and thus increased availability, within the C&D portfolio. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures was also increased $500,000 during the first quarter of 2022 as a result of the CB acquisition, with the offset recorded to goodwill (as opposed to provision expense). The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures totaled $4.5 million as of December 31, 2022.

Discussion of 2024 vs 2023:

Total non-interest income increased $3.0 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Non-interest income comprised 27% of total revenue, defined as net interest income and non-interest income, for the years ended both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. WM&T revenue comprised 45% of total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 43% for the same period of 2023, respectively.

WM&T Services:

The magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community banks of similar asset size. WM&T revenue increased $3.0 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023, consistent with strong equity market appreciation and higher estate fee income, which more than offset a decline in net new business expansion.

Net new business refers to revenue generated from newly acquired customers, excluding revenue from upselling or cross-selling to existing active customers. It plays a crucial role in expanding Bancorp’s financial base and ensuring long-term sustainability and success. During the third quarter of 2024, the WM&T department experienced negative net new business for the first time in several years, driven in large part to attrition associated with employee retirements and market competition. Total WM&T revenue is currently projected to increase over the next twelve months, although not at levels experienced in the past, as projected moderate market growth would more than offset the potential negative impact from the previously mentioned attrition and an expected decline in non-recurring estate fees. Positions impacted by attrition have been filled and Bancorp expects WM&T to begin experiencing positive net new business in the coming quarters.

Recurring fees earned for managing accounts are based on a percentage of market value of AUM and are typically assessed on a monthly basis. Recurring fees, which generally comprise the vast majority of WM&T revenue, increased $2.6 million, or 7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023. The increase was driven largely by equity market appreciation over the past year.

A portion of WM&T revenue, most notably estate and certain employee benefit plan-related fees, are non-recurring in nature and the timing of these revenues corresponds with the related administrative activities. For this reason, such fees are subject to greater period over period fluctuation. Total non-recurring fees increased $432,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023, driven by increased estate fee income.

AUM, stated at market value, totaled $7.07 billion at December 31, 2024 compared with $7.16 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease in AUM between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 is attributed mainly to the previously mentioned decline in net new business.

Contracts between WM&T and their customers do not permit performance-based fees and accordingly, none of the WM&T revenue is performance based. Management believes the WM&T department will continue to factor significantly in Bancorp’s financial results and provide strategic diversity to revenue streams.

The preceding table demonstrates that WM&T fee revenue is concentrated within investment advisory and personal trust accounts. WM&T fees are predominantly based on AUM and tailored for individual/company accounts and/or relationships with fee structures customized based on account type and other factors, with larger relationships paying a lower percentage of AUM in fees. For example, recurring AUM fee structures are in place for investment management, irrevocable and revocable trusts, personal investment retirement accounts and accounts holding only fixed income securities. WM&T also provides company retirement plan services, which can consist of a one-time conversion fee with recurring AUM fees to follow. While there are also fee structures for estate settlements, income received is typically non-recurring in nature. Fee structures are agreed upon at the time of account opening and any subsequent revisions are communicated in writing to the customer. As previously mentioned, WM&T fees earned are not performance-based nor are they based on investment strategy or transactions.

Includes client directed instruments such as rights, warrants, annuities, insurance policies, unit investment trusts,

 and oil and gas rights.

Managed assets are invested in instruments for which market values can be readily determined, the majority of which are sensitive to market fluctuations and consist of approximately 65% in equities and 35% in fixed income securities as of December 31, 2024, compared to 64% and 36% as of December 31, 2023. This composition has been relatively consistent from period to period.

Additional Sources of Non-interest income:

Deposit service charges, which consist of non-sufficient funds charges and to a lesser extent, other activity based charges, increased $40,000, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023. Consistent with the banking industry generally, Bancorp has experienced a steady decline in the volume of fees earned on overdrawn checking accounts over the past several years. This trend has been driven by lower check presentment volume, which has in turn led to fewer overdrawn accounts in general. Further, Bancorp anticipates that future growth of this revenue stream could be significantly impacted by changing industry practices. Bancorp could be faced with strategic decisions surrounding deposit-related service charges in the future, which could negatively impact the contributions made by this, or similar, revenue streams.

Debit and credit card income consists of interchange revenue, ancillary fees and incentives received from card processors. Debit and credit card revenue increased $644,000, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023, driven mainly by higher transaction volume. Total debit card income increased $174,000, or 1%, and total credit card income increased $470,000, or 8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared the same period of the prior year. While Bancorp generally expects this revenue stream to grow with continued expansion of the customer base, interchange rate compression and fluctuations in business and consumer spend levels could serve as challenges to future growth.

Treasury management fees primarily consist of fees earned for cash management services provided to commercial customers. This category continues to stand out as a consistent, growing source of revenue for Bancorp and increased $1.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023, driven by customer base expansion, increased transaction volume, growing international services and new product sales. Bancorp anticipates this income category will continue to increase based on continued customer base growth and the expanding suite of services offered within Bancorp’s treasury management platform.

Mortgage banking income primarily includes gains on sales of mortgage loans and net loan servicing income offset by MSR amortization. Bancorp’s mortgage banking department predominantly originates residential mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market, primarily to FNMA and FHLMC. Bancorp offers conventional, VA, FHA and GNMA financing for purchases and refinances, as well as programs for first-time homebuyers. Interest rates on mortgage loans directly influence the volume of business transacted by the mortgage-banking department. Mortgage banking revenue increased $153,000, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023, driven by an increase in origination volume in addition to slowing MSR amortization.

Net investment product sales commissions and fees are generated primarily on stock, bond and mutual fund sales, as well as wrap fees earned on brokerage accounts via an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer. Wrap fees represent charges for investment programs that bundle together a suite of services, such as brokerage, advisory, research and management and are based on a percentage of account assets. Bancorp deploys its financial advisors primarily through its branch network, while larger managed accounts are generally serviced by Bancorp’s WM&T group. Net investment product sales commissions and fees increased $366,000, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 consistent with organic growth and general market appreciation over the respective period.

BOLI assets represent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain active and non-active employees who have provided consent for Bancorp to be the beneficiary for a portion of such policies. The related change in cash surrender value and any death benefits received under the policies are recorded as non-interest income and serves to offset the cost of various employee benefits. BOLI income increased $190,000, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of the prior year, attributed to general market appreciation and a reallocation of investments within the policy plans over the past year.

Losses on the sale of premises and equipment totaling $100,000 were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were the result of sales/disposals of various nominal fixed assets. Activity for the prior year was the result of the sale of an acquired property in addition to other merger-related disposal activity.

Other non-interest income decreased $2.4 million, or 49%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. The decrease was driven largely by Bancorp’s decision not to renew the Captive in late 2023, which contributed approximately $1.6 million of other non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023. Further, the prior year benefitted from a plethora of non-recurring activity, including higher swap fee income and gains on the sale of acquired VISA class B stock and an OREO property.

Discussion of 2023 vs 2022:

Total non-interest income increased $3.1 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. Non-interest income comprised 27% and 28% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. WM&T revenue comprised 43% of total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 41% for the same period of 2022, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2023 included a full 12 months of activity associated with the CB acquisition compared to approximately 10 months of such activity for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, a large gain recorded in relation to the sale of acquired properties benefitted the year ended December 31, 2022.

WM&T revenue increased $3.7 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with the same period of 2022, consistent with new business development expansion, increased estate fees and strong returns from the fixed income and equity markets.

Deposit service charges, which consist of non-sufficient funds charges and to a lesser extent, other activity based charges, increased $580,000, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the prior year.

Debit and credit card revenue increased $815,000, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the prior year. The increase stemmed mainly from organic growth and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity, which more than offset interchange rate compression. Total debit card income increased $384,000, or 3%, and total credit card income increased $431,000, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared the year ended December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents

Treasury management fees increased $1.4 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, driven by organic growth and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity, increased transaction volume, growing international services and new product sales.

Mortgage banking revenue increased $495,000, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the same period of 2022, driven largely by higher servicing fee income tied to the mortgage servicing portfolio added through the prior year acquisition.

As a result of the dissolution of the Captive during the fourth quarter of 2023, a loss totaling $44,000 on the sale of AFS treasury securities held by the Captive was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023. No such activity was recorded in 2022.

Net investment product sales commissions and fees increased $142,000, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the prior year, attributed to organic growth and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity.

BOLI income increased $656,000, or 41%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, which was attributed mainly to the additional $30 million BOLI investment made in 2022, in addition to general market appreciation within the policy plans during the year.

Gains and losses on the sale of premises and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the sale of an acquired property from CB during the third quarter and other nominal disposal activity. The large gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 stemmed from the sale of certain acquired properties from CB that overlapped with existing locations.

Other non-interest income decreased $336,000, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with the same period of 2022. The decrease was driven in large part by the disposition of Bancorp’s partial interest in LFA effective December 31, 2022, which contributed $1.3 million of other non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Further, Bancorp elected not to renew the Captive in August 2023 and fully dissolved it during the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in a $132,000 decrease in Captive income compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these declines were higher interest rate swap fee income, a $487,000 gain on the sale of VISA Class B stock originally acquired through the CB acquisition and stronger returns from insurance policies held outside of Bancorp’s BOLI portfolio compared to the prior year.

Discussion of 2024 vs 2023:

Total non-interest expenses increased $10.4 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Compensation and employee benefits comprised 61% of Bancorp’s total non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 59% for the same period of 2023.

Compensation, which includes salaries, incentives, bonuses and stock based compensation, increased 9.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023. The increases were attributed to annual merit-based salary increases, higher bonus accruals and to a lesser extent, increased incentive compensation. Net full time equivalent employees totaled 1,080 at December 31, 2024 compared to 1,075 at December 31, 2023.

Employee benefits consists of all personnel-related expense not included in compensation, with the most significant items being health insurance, payroll taxes and employee retirement plan contributions. Employee benefits increased $1.8 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023, driven mainly by an increase in health insurance claims activity.

Net occupancy and equipment expenses primarily include depreciation, rent, property taxes, utilities and maintenance. Costs of capital asset additions flow through the statement of income over the lives of the assets in the form of depreciation expense. Net occupancy expense decreased $1.2 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the same period of 2023, as the prior year period included additional expense associated with centralizing the WM&T group into a singular location. At December 31, 2024, Bancorp’s branch network consisted of 72 locations throughout Louisville, central, eastern and Northern Kentucky, as well as the MSAs of Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio.

Technology and communication expenses include computer software usage and licensing fees, equipment depreciation and expenditures related to investments in technology needed to maintain and improve the quality of customer delivery channels, information security and internal resources. Technology expense increased $1.9 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, consistent with Bancorp’s growth and continued investment in technology, including various security and compliance-related software upgrades.

Bancorp outsources processing for debit and credit card operations, which generate significant revenue for the Company. These expenses typically fluctuate consistent with transaction volumes. Debit and credit card processing expense increased $781,000, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of last 2023, driven by increased transaction volume, customer base expansion and additional expense associated with fraud detection/mitigation services.

Marketing and business development expenses include all costs associated with promoting Bancorp, including community support, retaining customers and acquiring new business. Marketing and business development expenses increased $934,000, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023, driven in large part by higher advertising expense tied to time deposit product promotions. Bancorp also increased its contribution to the Bank’s foundation established to support various community initiatives.

Postage, printing and supplies expense increased $41,000, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.

Legal and professional fees increased $153,000, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase related to compliance-related consulting projects associated with Bancorp approaching $10 billion in total assets.

FDIC insurance expense increased $628,000, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023, consistent with Bancorp’s growth in addition to changes in loan mix, as higher assessments are levied on C&D lending concentrations, a segment which grew as a percentage of total loans.

Effective January 1, 2024, Bancorp adopted ASU 2023-02 and began booking tax credit amortization expense for all historical and low income tax credit projects as a component of income tax expense via the proportional amortization method. Such expense had previously been recorded as a component of non-interest expenses. As such, no tax credit amortization expense was recorded as non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024. Expense of $1.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Capital and deposit based taxes, which consist primarily of capital-based local income taxes and franchise taxes, increased $305,000, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Bancorp’s capital and deposit based tax expense is based on deposits held within various local taxing districts, as well as gross revenues generated within/appropriated to the state of Ohio, which is the only state Bancorp operates in with a capital-based deposit tax.

Intangible amortization expense consists of amortization associated with the CDI of acquired deposit portfolios, as well as an intangible related to customer list of the WM&T business line added through a past acquisition. The intangibles are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of approximately ten years. Intangible amortization expense decreased $201,000, or 4%, for the year December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, which is attributed to the accelerated depreciation method for which intangible assets are amortized.

Other non-interest expenses decreased $2.5 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023, driven largely by Bancorp’s decision not to renew the Captive in late 2023, in addition to the benefit of modifications made to the corporate credit card reward program and a decline in fraudulent check and card losses.

Bancorp’s efficiency ratio (FTE) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 56.20% and 55.23%, respectively. The increase in this ratio was the result of non-interest expense growth (on a percentage basis) outpacing net interest income and non-interest income expansion, as net interest income was hampered by rising funding costs.

Discussion of 2023 vs 2022:

Total non-interest expenses decreased $4.0 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022. While the year ended December 31, 2022 included one-time merger expenses associated with the completion of the CB acquisition, it only included approximately 10 months of normal, recurring expenses associated with the acquisition. Compensation and employee benefits comprised 59% and 54% of total non-interest expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding merger expenses, compensation and employee benefits comprised 60% of total non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Compensation expense increased $5.2 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The increase was attributed to growth in full time equivalent employees and annual merit-based salary increases. In addition, compensation expense totaling $630,000 related to an executive retirement agreement was also recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023. Net full time equivalent employees totaled 1,075 at December 31, 2023 compared to 1,033 at December 31, 2022.

Employee benefits increased $1.9 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, consistent with the overall increase in full time equivalent employees previously noted.

Net occupancy increased $2.1 million, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The increase was attributed to relocation of all WM&T employees into a consolidated location as part of finalizing the CB integration plan. Further, the prior year period included only 10 months of acquisition-related activity and the opening of Bancorp’s new operations center in the latter part of 2022.

Technology expense increased $2.4 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, consistent with the full year impact of acquisition-related activity, customer expansion and continued investment in technology.

Debit and credit card processing expense increased $572,000, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, consistent with the increase in transaction volume and customer base expansion resulting from both organic growth and the full year impact of acquisition-related activity.

Marketing and business development expenses increased $985,000, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The increase was consistent with strategic decisions to advertise in Bancorp’s new markets, increased advertising expense associated with Bancorp’s deposit promotions and the general expansion of Bancorp’s existing and prospective customer base.

Postage, printing and supplies expense increased $250,000, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, consistent with Bancorp’s expansion and promotional mailings.

Legal and professional fees increased $1.0 million, or 34%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. The increase related to compliance-related consulting projects associated with Bancorp approaching $10 billion in total assets.

FDIC insurance increased $1.2 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, attributed to Bancorp’s asset growth and the FDIC-mandated increase of the uniform base assessment rate.

Capital and deposit based taxes decreased $145,000, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, driven by fluctuation in revenue growth generated within the state of Ohio.

Merger expenses totaling $19.5 million were recorded in relation to the CB acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Amortization expense associated with tax credit investments increased $941,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year stemming from Bancorp’s investment in several larger tax credit projects during 2023.

Intangible amortization expense decreased $858,000, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was attributed to both the accelerated depreciation method for which intangible assets are amortized, coupled with the previously mentioned disposal of Bancorp’s partial interest in LFA at the end of 2022, which included writing off the related CLI.

As previously noted, Bancorp’s partial interest in LFA was sold effective December 31, 2022. The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of $870,000, which was recorded as non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Other non-interest expenses increased $869,000, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, the most notable drivers being increased card reward expense, higher fraud and theft-related expenses and other ancillary expenses tied to Bancorp’s growth over the past year.

Table of Contents

Bancorp’s efficiency ratio (FTE) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 55.23% and 59.30%, respectively, the latter period reflecting one-time merger-related expenses attributed to the CB acquisition, all of which were recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Bancorp also considers an adjusted efficiency ratio, which eliminates net gains (losses) on sales, calls, and impairment of investment securities, as well as net gains (losses) on sales of premises and equipment and the disposition of any acquired assets, if applicable, and the fluctuation in non-interest expenses related to amortization of investments in tax credit partnerships and merger-related expenses. Bancorp’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 54.84% and 53.61% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See the section titled “

Discussion of 2024 vs 2023:

Fluctuations in the ETR are primarily attributed to the following:

●

The stock based compensation component of the ETR fluctuates consistent with the level of SAR exercise activity in addition to the levels of PSU, RSA and RSU vesting. The ETR was reduced by 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a reduction of 0.31% for the same period of 2023, consistent with exercise activity driven by the rise in Bancorp’s stock price during the year.

●

The cash surrender value of life insurance policies can vary widely from period to period, driven largely by market changes. The related impact is inversely correlated with the ETR generally, with cash surrender value declines typically serving to increase the ETR and vice versa. Changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies decreased the ETR by 0.61% and 0.64% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

●

Bancorp invests in certain partnerships that yield federal income tax credits. Taken as a whole, the tax benefit of these investments exceeds amortization expense, resulting in a positive impact on net income. The timing and magnitude of these transactions may vary widely from period to period. Effective January 1, 2024, Bancorp adopted ASU 2023-02 and began booking tax credit amortization expense for all tax credit projects as a component of income tax expense via the proportional amortization method. The cumulative impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-02 and tax credit amortization for the year ended December 31, 2024 served to reduce the ETR by 1.54%. The ETR was reduced by 0.54% by tax credit activity for the year ended December 31, 2023.

●

Tax-exempt interest income earned on loans and investment securities reduced the ETR by 0.43% and 0.50% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

●

Activity related to the Captive, which previously provided tax advantages associated with the tax-deductible/exempt nature of insurance premiums paid to/received by the Captive, reduced the ETR by 0.20% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Bancorp elected not to renew the Captive during the third quarter of 2023 and subsequently dissolved it as of December 31, 2023. No tax benefit associated with the Captive was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Discussion of 2023 vs 2022:

Fluctuations in the ETR are primarily attributed to the following:

●

The ETR was reduced by 0.31% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a reduction of 0.97% for the prior year, as a result exercise and vesting activity related to stock based compensation.

●

Changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies decreased the ETR by 0.64% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to an increase of 0.18% the same period of the prior year.

●

The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was reduced by 0.34% and increased by 0.34%, respectively, based on tax credit activity.

Financial Condition 
–
 December 31, 2024 Compared to December 31, 2023

Overview

Total assets increased $693 million, or 9%, to $8.86 billion at December 31, 2024 from $8.17 billion at December 31, 2023. Total loans increased $749 million, or 13%, as strong loan production drove growth in nearly every loan category. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline of $111 million, or 8%, in the investment securities portfolio, as scheduled maturity and paydown activity was used to provide liquidity and fund substantial loan growth in lieu of redeployment into the investment securities portfolio.

Total liabilities increased $611 million, or 8%, to $7.92 billion at December 31, 2024 from $7.31 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was attributed to a $496 million, or 7%, increase in total deposits and a $100 million increase in FHLB borrowings, which were both utilized in funding the previously mentioned loan growth.

Stockholders’ equity increased $82 million, or 10%, to $940 million at December 31, 2024 from $858 million at December 31, 2023, as net income of $114.5 million and a small improvement in AOCI was offset by $35.9 million of cash dividends declared in 2024. The improvement in AOCI was associated with changes in the interest rate environment and the corresponding impact on the valuation of the AFS debt securities portfolio and cash flow hedging derivatives. Further, a $2.5 million increase in retained earnings was recorded in relation to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2024.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents increased $25 million, or 9%, ending at $291 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $266 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was attributed mainly to a combination of liquidity provided by the investment securities portfolio and funding fluctuations.

Investment Securities

The primary purpose of the investment securities portfolio is to provide another source of interest income, as well as a tool for liquidity management. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, Bancorp seeks a balance between earnings sources, credit and liquidity considerations.

Investment securities decreased $111 million, or 8%, to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $1.47 billion at December 31, 2023, driven by scheduled maturity and pay down activity within the portfolio. Investment in the securities portfolio was minimal during 2024, with the exception of purchases made to meet collateral pledging requirements, as Bancorp elected to maintain higher levels of liquidity amidst substantial loan growth and deposit fluctuations during the year.

Actual maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayments on underlying collateral.

FHLB Stock

FHLB stock holdings increased $5 million to $22 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $16 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by FHLB borrowing activity during 2024, as FHLB members are required to hold certain levels of FHLB stock in relation to the amount of their borrowings. Overnight borrowing activity increased during 2024, as a result of strong loan growth and deposit fluctuations. Bancorp’s FHLB stock holdings will fluctuate consistent with borrowing activity from period to period.

Loans

Total loans increased $749 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. While the substantial loan growth experienced during 2024 was well-spread across loan categories, CRE , C&D and C&I lines of credit stood out, with growth of 15%, 17% and 26%, respectively.

Total line of credit utilization has experienced steady improvement throughout 2024, ending at 45.9% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 39.2% at December 31, 2023. Increased utilization has been experienced within the C&D and C&I portfolios specifically, the latter of which has improved to 33.7% at December 31, 2024 from 28.6% at December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents

Bancorp’s credit exposure is diversified between businesses and individuals. No specific industry concentration exceeds 10% of loans outstanding. While Bancorp has a diversified loan portfolio, a customer’s ability to honor loan agreements is somewhat dependent upon the economic stability and/or industry in which that customer does business. Loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments are primarily concentrated within Bancorp’s current market areas, which encompass the Louisville, Kentucky MSA, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio MSAs.

CRE represents the largest segment of Bancorp’s loan portfolio, totaling $2.84 billion, or 44%, of total loans as of December 31, 2024. While a combination of sustained higher interest rates and rising central business district vacancies across the country has created credit and collateral concerns within the CRE sector generally, Bancorp believes the quality of its CRE portfolio, and the overall loan portfolio, remains solid.

Office building exposure, which is a sub-segment of CRE and perceived to be of particular risk in the current environment, is a smaller component of Bancorp’s loan portfolio, totaling $580 million, or 9%, of total loans as of December 31, 2024. Approximately $242 million, or 42%, of Bancorp’s office building exposure is medical-related, which in management’s opinion presents reduced risk compared to other CRE uses. Approximately $306 million, or 53%, of the office building exposure is owner-occupied and is generally accompanied by a full commercial banking relationship. Bancorp’s office exposure is concentrated in Bancorp’s primary markets, with no exposure to large office towers and minimal exposure to central business districts, and continues to perform well with minimal substandard/non-accrual and past due loans as of December 31, 2024. 

Bancorp occasionally enters into loan participation agreements with other banks to diversify credit risk. For certain participation loans sold, Bancorp has retained effective control of the loans, typically by restricting the participating institutions from pledging or selling their ownership share of the loan without permission from Bancorp. GAAP requires the participated portion of these loans to be recorded as secured borrowings. These participated loans are included in the C&I and CRE loan portfolio segments with a corresponding liability recorded in other liabilities. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total participated portion of loans of this nature totaled $2 million and $4 million, respectively.

Non-performing assets totaled $22 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $19 million at December 31, 2023. The increase over this period was attributed mainly to an increase in owner-occupied residential real estate notes placed on non-accrual status during the year.

In total, non-performing assets as of December 31, 2024 were comprised of 125 loans ranging in individual amounts up to $4.5 million and one residential real estate property held as OREO.

Total non-accrual loans

$

21,727

$

19,058

Loans are placed in a non-accrual income status when prospects for recovering both principal and accrued interest are considered doubtful or when a default of principal or interest has existed for 90 days or more, unless such a loan is well- secured and in the process of collection or renewal. Interest income recorded on non-accrual loans as principal payments totaled $624,000, $342,000, and $160,000 for 2024, 2023, and 2022. Interest income that would have been recorded if non-accrual loans were on a current basis in accordance with their original terms totaled $1.3 million, $1.5 million, and $1.1 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022.

In addition to non-performing loans discussed above, there were loans, which are accruing interest, for which payments were current or less than 90 days past due where borrowers are experiencing elevated financial difficulties. These substandard loans totaled approximately $60 million and $43 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the increase over the prior year being attributed to a number of C&I relationships being downgraded in 2024. These relationships are monitored closely for possible future reclassification as non-performing loans. Management believes it has adequately reflected credit exposure in these loans in its determination of the allowance.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no modifications made to loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and there were no payment defaults of existing modified loans within 12 months following modification. Default is determined at 90 days or more past due, charge off, or foreclosure.

Delinquent Loans

Delinquent loans (consisting of all loans 30 days or more past due) totaled $32 million and $17 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Delinquent loans to total loans were 0.50% and 0.30% at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in delinquent loans over this period was driven mainly by four larger and unrelated CRE and C&I relationships that were past due as of December 31, 2024, three of which were placed on non-accrual status and a general increase in past due owner-occupied residential real estate loans. Approximately $10 million of loans in delinquent status as of December 31, 2024 became current in early 2025, including $3 million of loans that fully paid off.

Classified Loans

Classified loans, which consist of loans defined as OAEM, substandard, substandard non-performing (including non-accrual loans discussed above) and doubtful, totaled $162 million and $96 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The increase over this period was driven mainly by loans classified as OAEM and substandard, which increased $63 million in total over this period.

Loans classified as OAEM have potential weaknesses requiring management’s heightened attention that may result in deterioration of repayment prospects on the loan or of Bancorp’s credit position at some future date. OAEM loans totaled $81 million and $34 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in OAEM loans experienced between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 was driven by a small number of relationships that were downgraded to OAEM, with one C&I relationship representing $16 million of the increase. Further, approximately $9 million of notes classified as OAEM as of December 31, 2024 represent loans that were upgraded from the substandard classification during 2024. As of December 31, 2024, $81 million, or 99%, of loans classified as OAEM were current with their contractual payments.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans

The ACL for loans is a valuation allowance for loans estimated at each balance sheet date in accordance with GAAP. When Bancorp deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received. See the footnote titled “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
”

for discussion of Bancorp’s ACL methodology on loans. Allocations of the ACL may be made for specific loans, but the entire ACL for loans is available for any loan that, in Bancorp’s judgment, should be charged-off.  

Bancorp’s ACL for loans was $87 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $79 million as of December 31, 2023. Provision expense for credit losses on loans of $8.8 million was recorded for the year December 31, 2024, driven mainly by strong loan growth, and to a much lesser extent, an improved unemployment forecast and other factors within the CECL model. Net charge offs of $1.2 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024, serving to reduce the ACL for loans.

The ACL for loans calculation and resulting credit loss expense is significantly impacted by changes in forecasted economic conditions. Should the forecast for economic conditions change, Bancorp could experience further adjustments in its required ACL for loans credit loss expense.

The allocation of the ACL for loans amongst respective classes of the loan portfolio experienced a shift between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, most notably within the CRE and C&I categories. This shift was driven by a thorough evaluation of the qualitative factors within the CECL methodology performed during the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in an increased allocation of the ACL to the C&I segment and a reduced allocation of the ACL to the CRE segment.

The larger qualitative allocation that had previously been assigned to the CRE portfolio stemmed from pandemic-era concerns surrounding certain concentrations within this segment and subsequent concerns related to the impact of rising interest rates. As the CRE portfolio has continued to perform well despite interest rate fluctuations, these original concerns have been alleviated. Further, there has been minimal charge-off activity within the CRE portfolio for several quarters and delinquent loans within the segment have trended downward. Considering all of these factors, management believes a lower qualitative allocation to the CRE portfolio was warranted.

Offsetting the reduced qualitative allocation for the CRE portfolio as of December 31, 2024 was an increased qualitative allocation for the C&I portfolio. C&I concerns were driven by both recent and long-term charge off activity being concentrated in this portfolio, increased specific reserves, and higher levels of OAEM and substandard loans within the C&I segment. Further, C&I customers have generally been more strained by current economic conditions and the dramatic increase in interest rates due to exposure to the variable rate structure of many C&I loans. As such, management believed a higher qualitative allocation to the C&I portfolio was warranted.

While separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, the ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures also experienced an increase between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. Provision for credit loss expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $925,000 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven largely by an increase in expected future utilization within the C&D portfolio. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures totaled $6.8 million as of December 31, 2024.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are presented on the consolidated balance sheets net of related depreciation on the respective assets, as well as fair value adjustments associated with purchase accounting. Premises and equipment increased $12 million, or 11%, between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, which was primarily the result of right-of-use lease asset additions. Bancorp’s branch network currently consists of 72 locations throughout Louisville, central, eastern and northern, Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio markets.

Premises held for sale totaling $2.3 million and $2.5 million was recorded on Bancorp’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which consists of three undeveloped parcels of land, a former administrative building and one former branch location.

BOLI

Bank-owned life insurance assets increased $2 million, or 3%, to $89 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $87 million at December 31, 2023, the increase being attributed to general appreciation of the cash surrender value experienced during the year.

Table of Contents

Goodwill 

At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp had $194 million in goodwill recorded on its balance sheet. Goodwill of $58 million and $123 million is attributed to the acquisitions of CB and KB in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, goodwill totaling $12 million and $682,000 is attributed to the acquisitions of KSB and Austin State Bank in 2019 and 1996, respectively. The acquisition of TBOC in 2013 resulted in a bargain purchase gain.

Events that could potentially trigger goodwill impairment include deterioration in economic conditions, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (i.e. stock price declining below tangible book value), negative trends in overall financial performance and regulatory actions. At September 30, 2024, Bancorp performed its annual qualitative assessment to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was not more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of the reporting units exceeded their fair value.          

Core Deposit and Customer List Intangibles

CDIs and CLIs arising from business acquisitions are initially measured at fair value and are then amortized on an accelerated method based on their useful lives. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp’s CDI assets totaled $9 million and $12 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Bancorp’s CLI assets totaled $7 million and $8 million, respectively, and were attributed entirely to the WM&T segment.

As of December 31, 2024, Bancorp did not incur any impairment with respect to its intangible assets or other long-lived assets.

Other Assets and Other Liabilities

Other assets increased $21 million, or 7%, to $309 million between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. Other liabilities increased $12 million, or 5%, to $258 million over the same period. The increase in other assets stems mainly from market value changes in interest rate swap assets and recording additional tax credit investment assets. The increase in other liabilities was driven largely by right-of-use lease liability additions (the balance sheet offset of the previously mentioned right-of-use asset additions) and increases in various accruals, including compensation and employee benefit liabilities.

Deposits

Total deposits increased $496 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. Interest bearing deposits increased $588 million, or 11%, outpacing the $92 million, or 6%, decrease in non-interest bearing deposits, as depositors continued shifting into higher-yielding alternatives in the current environment.

Bancorp continued to experience a shift in the deposit portfolio mix in 2024, as customers sought higher-yielding alternatives to low-rate or non-interest bearing deposits in the higher rate environment. As a result, the cost of interest-bearing deposits rose to 2.59% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 1.77% for the same period of the prior year, with the cost of total deposits (including non-interest deposits) rising to 2.01% from 1.28%. While deposit costs placed pressure on NIM in 2024, they began to moderate in tandem with anticipated interest rate reductions from the FRB in the latter part of the year.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Bancorp estimates that approximately $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion of its deposit portfolio was uninsured, respectively. The uninsured amounts are estimates based on methodologies and assumptions used by Bancorp in accordance with regulatory reporting requirements. Included in these totals are certain public fund and other deposits for which Bancorp pledges investment securities as collateral. In conjunction with FDIC insurance, the pledged collateral effectively guarantees the full amount of these deposits, which totaled $852 million and $800 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Bancorp is a commercial bank, and as a result, is dependent on large commercial deposit relationships as a primary funding source. While this dependance drives an uninsured deposit ratio that may be higher than some of Bancorp’s similarly-sized peers, the majority of these deposits are considered to be core funds, as they represent long-standing, full-service relationships and are a testament to Bancorp’s commitment to partner with business customers by providing exemplary service and competitive products. Bancorp monitors and evaluates this primary funding source frequently and maintains numerous secondary funding sources as part of a multifaceted contingency funding plan.

Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase

SSUAR represent a funding source of Bancorp and are used by commercial customers in conjunction with collateralized corporate cash management accounts. Such repurchase agreements are considered financing agreements and mature within one business day from the transaction date. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of these financing arrangements had overnight maturities and were secured by government sponsored enterprise obligations and government agency mortgage-backed securities that were owned and controlled by Bancorp.

SSUARs are collateralized by securities and are treated as financings; accordingly, the securities involved with the agreements are recorded as assets and are held by a safekeeping agent and the obligations to repurchase the securities are reflected as liabilities. All securities underlying the agreements are under the Bancorp’s control.

SSUARs increased $10 million, or 7%, between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024.

Table of Contents

Federal Funds Purchased and Other Short-Term Borrowing

FFP and other short-term borrowing balances decreased $6 million between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, FFP related mainly to excess liquidity held by downstream correspondent bank customers of Bancorp.

Subordinated debentures

As a result of the CB acquisition, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of the following unconsolidated trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS. The TPS are treated as part of Tier 1 Capital. The subordinated note and related interest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. The subordinated notes are currently redeemable at Bancorp’s option on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2024, subordinated notes added through the CB acquisition totaled $27 million.

FHLB advances

FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled $300 million and $200 million, respectively. Total advances at December 31, 2024 consisted of a $300 million three-month rolling advance related to four separate interest rate swaps (cash flow hedges) entered into in an effort to secure longer-term funding at more attractive rates. At December 31, 2023, total advances consisted of a $200 million three-month rolling advance related to three separate interest rate swaps (cash flow hedges). For more information related to the interest rate swaps noted above, see the footnote titled, “
Derivative Financial Instruments.
”

While there were no overnight advances outstanding as of December 31, 2024, overnight advances were utilized more frequently during 2024, consistent with substantial loan growth and deposit fluctuations. The increased activity is reflected in average total FHLB advances for 2024, which experienced an $89 million, or 32%, increase over the prior year.

Liquidity

The role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands, while at the same time maximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in supply of funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term assets that can be converted to cash, AFS debt securities, various lines of credit available to Bancorp, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits. Management believes it has the ability to increase deposits at any time by offering rates slightly higher than market rate.

Bancorp’s Asset/Liability Committee is comprised of senior management and has direct oversight responsibility for Bancorp’s liquidity position and profile. A combination of reports provided to management details internal liquidity metrics, composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, and exposure to contingent draws on Bancorp’s liquidity.

Bancorp’s most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, FFS and AFS debt securities. FFS and interest bearing deposits totaled $212 million and $171 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. FFS normally have overnight maturities while interest-bearing deposits in banks are accessible on demand. These investments are used for general daily liquidity purposes.

The fair value of the AFS debt security portfolio was $990 million and $1.03 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in AFS debt security portfolio during 2024 was attributed to scheduled maturities, mainly within the treasury portfolio, and normal pay down activity, offset slightly by market value appreciation during the period. The investment portfolio (HTM and AFS) includes total cash flows on amortizing debt securities of approximately $515 million (based on assumed prepayment speeds as of December 31, 2024) expected over the next 12 months, including $353 million of contractual maturities. Combined with FFS and interest bearing deposits from banks, AFS debt securities offer substantial resources to meet either loan growth or reductions in Bancorp’s deposit funding base.

Table of Contents

Bancorp pledges portions of its investment securities portfolio to secure public funds, cash balances of certain WM&T accounts and SSUAR. At December 31, 2024, the total carrying value of investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 63% of the debt securities portfolio, leaving approximately $508 million of unpledged debt securities, compared to 67% and $480 million at December 31, 2023.

Bancorp’s deposit base consists mainly of core deposits, which are defined as demand, savings, and money market deposit accounts, time deposits less than or equal to $250,000, and excludes public funds and brokered deposits. At December 31, 2024, such deposits totaled $6.14 billion and represented 86% of Bancorp’s total deposits, as compared with $5.78 billion, or 87% of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Because core deposits are less volatile and are often tied to other products of Bancorp through long lasting relationships, they normally do not place undue pressure on liquidity. However, deposits may generally be more sensitive to market rates, with potential decreases possibly straining Bancorp’s liquidity position.

As of December 31, 2024, Bancorp held no brokered deposits. Bancorp held brokered deposits totaling $597,000 as of December 31, 2023.

Included in total deposit balances at December 31, 2024 are $663 million in public funds generally comprised of accounts with local government agencies and public school districts in the markets in which Bancorp operates. At December 31, 2023, public funds deposits totaled $613 million.

Bancorp is a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati. As a member of the FHLB, Bancorp has access to credit products of the FHLB. Bancorp views these borrowings as a potential low cost alternative to brokered deposits. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, available credit from the FHLB totaled $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, the decline during this period being attributed to increased utilization of FHLB borrowings. Bancorp also had unsecured FFP lines with correspondent banks totaling $80 million at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

During the normal course of business, Bancorp enters into certain forms of off-balance sheet transactions, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. These transactions are managed through Bancorp’s various risk management processes. Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of Bancorp’s liquidity.

Bancorp’s principal source of cash is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. As discussed in the footnote titled “
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,
” as of January 1st of any year, the Bank may pay dividends in an amount equal to the Bank’s net income of the prior two years less any dividends paid for the same two years. At December 31, 2024, the Bank could pay an amount equal to $209 million in dividends to Bancorp without regulatory approval subject to ongoing capital requirements of the Bank.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Cash flow is provided primarily through financing activities of Bancorp, which include raising deposits and borrowing funds from institutional sources such as advances from the FHLB and FFP, as well as scheduled loan repayments and cash flows from AFS debt securities. These funds are primarily used to facilitate investment activities of Bancorp, which include making loans and purchasing securities for the investment portfolio. Another important source of cash is net income of the Bank from operating activities.  For further detail regarding the sources and uses of cash, see the “Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows” in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, Bancorp is party to activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments, commitments under operating leases and long-term debt.

Bancorp provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through loan commitments and standby letters of credit. Unused loan commitments decreased $18 million, or less than 1%, as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, consistent with the strong increase in line utilization experienced during the year, which reduced availability.

Most commitments to extend credit are an agreement to lend to a customer as long as collateral is available as agreed upon and there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Bancorp uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional guarantees as for on-balance sheet instruments. Bancorp evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, securities, equipment and real estate. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.

Additional detail regarding credit-related financial instruments, including both commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31, 2024 are as follows:

The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures, which is separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, was $6.8 million and $5.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Provision expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $925,000 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven largely by an increase in expected future utilization within the C&D portfolio. Provision expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $1.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Bancorp to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party beneficiary. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support commercial transactions. Standby letters of credit generally have maturities of one to two years.

In addition to owned banking facilities, Bancorp has entered into long-term leasing arrangements for certain branch facilities. Bancorp also has required future payments for a non-qualified defined benefit retirement plan, time deposit maturities and other obligations.

Required payments under such commitments at December 31, 2024 are as follows:

At December 31, 2024, stockholders’ equity totaled $940 million, representing an increase of $82 million, or 10%, compared to December 31, 2023, as net income of $114.5 million and a small improvement in AOCI was offset by $35.9 million of dividends declared during 2024. The improvement in AOCI was associated with changes in the interest rate environment and the corresponding impact on the valuation of the AFS debt securities portfolio and cash flow hedging derivatives. Further, a $2.5 million increase in retained earnings was recorded in relation to the adoption of ASU 2023-02 effective January 1, 2024. See the “
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders
’
 Equity
” for further detail of changes in equity. 

Bancorp’s TCE ratio and tangible book value per share, both non-GAAP disclosures, experienced improvement between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, which stemmed largely from recording net income of $114.5 million. TCE was 8.44% at December 31, 2024 compared to 8.09% at December 31, 2023, while tangible book value per share was $24.82 at December 31, 2024, compared to $21.95 at December 31, 2023. See the section titled “
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” for reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.

In May 2023, Bancorp’s Board of Directors extended its share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 1 million shares, or approximately 4% of Bancorp’s total common shares outstanding at the time. The plan, which will expire in May 2025 unless otherwise extended or completed at an earlier date, does not obligate Bancorp to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares prior to the plan’s expiration. No shares were repurchased in 2023, nor 2024, as Bancorp continues to prioritize capital preservation and liquidity management. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 741,000 shares remain eligible for repurchase under the current repurchase plan. 

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are required by regulators to meet risk-based capital standards. These standards, or ratios, measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The value of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted to reflect credit risks. See the footnote titled “
Regulatory Matters
” for additional detail regarding regulatory capital requirements, as well as capital ratios of Bancorp and the Bank. The Bank exceeds regulatory capital ratios required to be well-capitalized. Regulatory framework does not define well capitalized for holding companies. Management considers the effects of growth on capital ratios as it contemplates plans for expansion.

Capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 increased compared December 31, 2023, as a result of strong operating results, which served to offset substantial risk-weighted asset growth from the loan portfolio. Bancorp continues to exceed the regulatory requirements for all calculations. Bancorp and the Bank intend to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the “well-capitalized” requirements as defined by the FRB and the FDIC, in addition to the capital conservation buffer.

Banking regulators have categorized the Bank as well-capitalized. To meet the definition of well-capitalized for prompt corrective action requirements, a bank must have a minimum 6.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 8.0% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 10.0% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio and 5.0% Tier 1 Leverage ratio.

72

Table of Contents

Additionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, Bancorp and the Bank must hold a 2.5% capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for the Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital ratio necessary to be considered adequately-capitalized. At December 31, 2024, the adequately-capitalized minimums, including the capital conservation buffer, were a 7.0% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 8.5% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and 10.5% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio. Bancorp exceeded these levels as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

As a result of the CB acquisition, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of the following unconsolidated trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS. The TPS are treated as part of Tier 1 Capital. The subordinated note and related interest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. The subordinated notes are currently redeemable at Bancorp’s option on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2024, subordinated notes totaled $27 million.

As permitted by the interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020 by the federal banking regulatory agencies, Bancorp elected the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital related to the adoption of ASC 326 “
Financial Instruments 
–
 Credit Losses,
”

or CECL
, 
which was effective January 1, 2020. The initial impact of adoption of ASC 326, as well as 25% of the quarterly increases in the ACL subsequent to adoption of ASC 326 (collectively the “transition adjustments”) were delayed for two years. After two years, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments became fixed and will be phased out of the regulatory capital calculations evenly over a three-year period, with 75% recognized in year three, 50% recognized in year four and 25% recognized in year five. After five years, the temporary regulatory capital benefits are fully reversed. 2024 represented the fifth and final year of the transition period for Bancorp. Had Bancorp not elected to defer the regulatory capital impact of CECL, the post ASC 326 adoption capital ratios of Bancorp and the Bank would still have exceeded the well-capitalized level.

Fair Value Measurements

Bancorp follows the provisions of authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance is definitional and disclosure oriented and addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by GAAP. It prescribes various disclosures about financial statement categories and amounts which are measured at fair value, if such disclosures are not already specified elsewhere in GAAP.

Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between participants at the measurement date. The guidance requires fair value measurements to be classified as Level 1 (quoted prices), Level 2 (based on observable inputs) or Level 3 (based on significant unobservable, internally-derived inputs).

Bancorp’s AFS debt securities and interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other accounts including mortgage loans held for sale, MSRs, impaired loans and OREO may be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis, generally in the application of lower of cost or market adjustments or write-downs of specific assets.

The AFS debt securities portfolio is comprised of U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government obligations, debt securities of U.S. government-sponsored corporations (including mortgage-backed securities), and obligations of state and political subdivisions. U.S. Treasury securities are priced using quoted prices of identical securities in an active market. These measurements are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy above. All other securities are priced using standard industry models or matrices with various assumptions such as yield curves, volatility, prepayment speeds, default rates, time value, credit rating and market prices for similar instruments. These assumptions are generally observable in the market place and can be derived from or supported by observable data. These measurements are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy above.

Interest rate swaps are valued using primarily Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements generally based on benchmark forward yield curves and other relevant observable market data. For purposes of potential valuation adjustments to derivative positions, Bancorp evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties as well as its own credit risk. To date, Bancorp has not realized any losses due to a counterparty’s inability to perform and the change in value of derivative assets and liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during 2024, 2023 and 2022.

73

Table of Contents

MSRs, carried in other assets and recorded at fair value upon capitalization, are amortized to correspond with estimated servicing income and are periodically assessed for impairment based on fair value at the reporting date. Fair value is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. These measurements are classified as Level 3. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no valuation allowance for MSRs, as fair value exceeded carrying value.

Loans considered to be collateral dependent are measured for impairment and, if indicated, a specific allocation is established based on the value of underlying collateral. Collateral dependent loans include non-accrual loans, individually analyzed PCD loans and loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For collateral dependent loans, fair value amounts represent only those loans with specific valuation allowances established or adjusted and loans charged down to their carrying value during the period. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of collateral dependent loans measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis was $12 million and $14 million, respectively. These measurements are classified as Level 3.

OREO, which is carried in other assets at the lower of cost or fair value, is periodically assessed for impairment based on fair value at the reporting date. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals or valuations performed by internal or external parties which use judgments and assumptions that are property-specific and sensitive to changes in the overall economic environment. Appraisals may be further discounted based on management’s judgement and/or changes in market conditions from the date of the most recent appraisal. Many of these inputs are not observable and, accordingly, these measurements are classified as Level 3. OREO is equal to the carrying value of only parcels of OREO for which carrying value equals appraised value. If a parcel of OREO has a carrying value below its appraised value, it is not considered to be carried at fair value. The losses represent write-downs which occurred during the period indicated. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of OREO totaled $10,000.

See the footnote titled “
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value
,” for additional detail regarding fair value measurements.

The efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, equals total non-interest expenses divided by the sum of net interest income (FTE) and non-interest income. In addition to the efficiency ratio presented, Bancorp considers an adjusted efficiency ratio. Bancorp believes it is important because it provides a comparable ratio after eliminating net gains (losses) on sales, calls, and impairment of investment securities, as well as net gains (losses) on sales of premises and equipment and disposition of any acquired assets, if applicable, and the fluctuation in non-interest expenses related to amortization of investments in tax credit partnerships and non-recurring merger expenses, if applicable.

Interest income on a FTE basis includes the additional amount of interest income that would have been earned if investments in certain tax-exempt interest earning assets had been made in assets subject to federal, state and local taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Interest income, yields and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal corporate income tax rate of 21%.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations
 – Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. (“Bancorp” or “the Company”) is a FHC headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary, SYB (“the Bank”). Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements of Bancorp and its subsidiaries have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and adhere to predominant practices within the banking industry.

Established in 1904, SYB is a state-chartered non-member financial institution that provides services in Louisville, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan markets through 72 full service banking center locations.

Bancorp is divided into 
two
 reportable segments: Commercial Banking and WM&T:

Commercial Banking provides a full range of loan and deposit products to individual consumers and businesses in all its markets through retail lending, mortgage banking, deposit services, online banking, mobile banking, private banking, commercial lending, commercial real estate lending, leasing, treasury management services, merchant services, international banking, correspondent banking, credit card services and other banking services. The Bank also offers securities brokerage services via its banking center network through an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer in the Commercial Banking segment. 

WM&T provides investment management, financial & retirement planning and trust & estate services, as well as retirement plan management for businesses and corporations in all markets in which Bancorp operates. The magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community banks of similar asset size.

As a result of its acquisition of CB on March 7, 2022, Bancorp became the 
100
% successor owner of the following unconsolidated Delaware trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS.

Also as a result of its acquisition of Commonwealth Bancshares, Inc., Bancorp acquired a 
60
% interest in LFA, a Bowling Green, Kentucky-based wealth management services company. Effective December 31, 2022, Bancorp’s partial interest in LFA was sold, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $
870,000
 recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated income statements for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. This acquired line of business was not within the Company’s geographic footprint and ultimately did not align with the Company’s long-term strategic model. Net income related to LFA and attributable to Bancorp’s 
60
% interest, excluding the pre-tax loss on disposition noted above, totaled $
483,000
 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

As a result of its acquisition of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. on May 31, 2021, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of a Nevada-based insurance captive taxed under Section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. On April 10, 2023, the IRS issued a proposed regulation that would potentially classify section 831(b) captive activity as a, “listed transaction,” and possibly disallow the related tax benefits, both prospectively and retroactively. The regulation was finalized in January 2025 and its impact is being evaluated by management. Bancorp elected not to renew the Captive in August of 2023 and ultimately dissolved the Captive in December of 2023. The Captive’s activity is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and was included in its 2023 federal income tax return. The Captive’s activity served to reduce Bancorp’s ETR by 
0.20
% and 
0.29
% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 – To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates and assumptions that require difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.

83

Table of Contents

Bancorp’s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2024, the accounting policy considered the most critical in preparing Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements is the determination of the ACL for loans. A detailed explanation of how Bancorp determines the ACL for loans is provided within this footnote.

Bancorp accounts for acquisitions in accordance with the acquisition method as outlined in ASC Topic 805, “
Business Combinations
.” The acquisition method requires: a) identification of the entity that obtains control of the acquiree; b) determination of the acquisition date; c) recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; and d) recognition and measurement of goodwill or bargain purchase gain.

Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in acquirees are generally recognized at their acquisition-date (“day-one”) fair values based on the requirements of ASC Topic 820, “
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
” The measurement period for day-one fair values begins on the acquisition date and ends at the earlier of: (a) the day management believes it has all the information necessary to determine day-one fair values; or (b) one year following the acquisition date. In many cases, the determination of day-one fair values requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly complex and subjective in nature and subject to provisional period adjustments, which are retrospective adjustments to reflect new information existing at the acquisition date affecting day-one fair values. More specifically, these provisional period adjustments may be made, as market value data, such as valuations, are received by the Bank. Increases or decreases to day-one fair values are reflected with a corresponding increase or decrease to bargain purchase gain or goodwill.

Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred unless those costs are related to issuing debt or equity securities used to finance the acquisition.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

–

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, FFS and interest bearing due from banks as segregated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Mortgage Banking Activities
 – Effective March 31, 2022, Bancorp elected to begin carrying mortgages originated and intended for sale in the secondary at fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Mortgage loans held for sale prior to March 31, 2022 were carried at the lower of cost or market value. Net gains on mortgage loans held for sale are recorded as a component of Mortgage banking income and represent the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the loans sold. Substantially all of the gains or losses on the sale of loans are reported in earnings when the interest rates on loans are locked.

Commitments to fund mortgage loans (“interest rate lock commitments”) to be sold into the secondary market and non-exchange traded mandatory forward sales contracts (“forward contracts”) for the future delivery of these mortgage loans or the purchase of TBA securities are accounted for as free-standing derivatives. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date the Bank enters into the derivative. Generally, the Bank enters into forward contracts for the future delivery of mortgage loans or the purchase of TBA securities when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to hedge the change in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. Changes in the fair values of these mortgage derivatives are included in net gains on sales of loans, which is a component of mortgage banking income on the income statement.

Mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with the MSRs retained. When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded as component of mortgage banking income. Fair value is based on the market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method, which requires servicing rights to be amortized into mortgage banking income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Amortization of MSRs are initially set at 
seven
 years and are periodically adjusted based on the weighted average remaining life of the underlying loans.

Table of Contents

A primary factor influencing the MSR fair value is the estimated life of the underlying serviced loans. The estimated life of the serviced loans is significantly influenced by market interest rates. During a period of declining interest rates, the fair value of the MSRs generally decline due to higher expected prepayments within the portfolio. Alternatively, during a period of rising interest rates, the fair value of MSRs generally will increase, as prepayments on the underlying loans would be expected to decline.

Loan servicing income is reported on the income statement as a component of Mortgage banking income. Loan servicing income is recorded as loan payments are collected and includes servicing fees from investors and certain charges collected from borrowers. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal, or a fixed amount per loan, and are recorded as income when earned. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are considered nominal.

Debt Securities

–

Bancorp determines the classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as AFS and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in AOCI, net of tax.

Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific-identification method. Amortization of premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the period to maturity using the interest method, except for premiums on callable debt securities, which are amortized to their earliest call date.

Bancorp has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of debt securities and reports accrued interest separately in the consolidated balance sheets. A debt security is placed on non-accrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become more than 90 days delinquent or if full collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. Accrued interest for a security placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. There was no accrued interest related to AFS debt securities reversed against interest income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

 AFS Debt Securities

–

For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, Bancorp evaluates the securities to determine whether the decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis (impairment) is due to credit-related factors or non-credit related factors. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in AOCI, net of tax. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an ACL for AFS debt securities on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. 
Accrued interest receivable
 on AFS debt securities totaled $
4
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the ACL for AFS debt securities and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if Bancorp intends to sell an impaired AFS debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL for AFS debt securities in this situation.

In evaluating AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding its intent or requirement to sell such securities, Bancorp considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers’ financial condition, among other factors. There were no credit related factors underlying unrealized losses on AFS debt securities at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, therefore, 
no
 ACL for AFS securities was recorded.

Changes in the ACL for AFS debt securities are recorded as expense. Losses are charged against the ACL for AFS debt securities when management believes the uncollectability of an AFS debt security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.

ACL 
–
 HTM Debt Securities

– Bancorp measures expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. 
Accrued interest receivable
 on HTM debt securities totaled $
1
 million and $
2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is excluded from the ACL on HTM securities. The estimate of the ACL for HTM securities considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
no
 ACL for HTM securities was recorded.

FHLB Stock

–

Bancorp is a member institution of the FHLB. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors and may invest in additional amounts of stock. FHLB stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security and annually evaluated for impairment. Because this stock is viewed as a long-term investment, impairment is based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are recorded as interest income.

Loans

–

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at amortized cost basis, which is the unpaid principal balance outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred loan fees and costs, premiums and discounts associated with acquisition date fair value adjustments on acquired loans and any direct partial charge-offs. Bancorp has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of loans and report accrued interest separately from the related loan balance in the consolidated balance sheets.

Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income over the life of the loan without anticipating prepayments.

Loans are considered past due or delinquent when the contractual principal and/or interest due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement or any portion thereof remains unpaid after the due date of the scheduled payment. The accrual of interest income on loans is typically discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection, or if full collection of interest or principal becomes doubtful. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 120 days past due. All interest accrued but not received for a loan placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero. Under the cash-basis method, interest income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Acquired loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition based on a DCF methodology that considers various factors including the type of loan and related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan and whether or not the loan was amortizing, and a discount rate reflecting Bancorp’s assessment of risk inherent in the cash flow estimates. Certain larger purchased loans are individually evaluated while certain purchased loans are grouped together according to similar risk characteristics and are treated in aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. These cash flow evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.

Loans acquired in a business combination that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered PCD loans. At the acquisition date, an estimate of expected credit losses is made for groups of PCD loans with similar risk characteristics and individual PCD loans without similar risk characteristics. This initial ACL is allocated to individual PCD loans and added to the purchase price or acquisition date fair values to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the PCD loans. As the initial ACL is added to the purchase price, there is no credit loss expense recognized upon acquisition of a PCD loan. Any difference between the unpaid principal balance of PCD loans and the amortized cost basis is considered to relate to non-credit factors and results in a discount or premium. Discounts and premiums are recognized through interest income on a level-yield method over the life of the loans.

Acquired loans are determined by Bancorp to have more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination if any of the following designations apply, listed in order of priority as follows: Loans individually analyzed by Bancorp and determined to have a collateral or cash flow deficiency resulting in a full or partial allocation for loss, loans placed on non-accrual status by the acquired institution, loans identified as TDRs by the acquired institution, loans that have received a partial charge off by the acquired institution, loans risk-rated below a “pass” grade by the acquired institution and any loans past due 59 days or more at the time of acquisition.

For acquired loans not deemed PCD at acquisition, the differences between the initial fair value and the unpaid principal balance are recognized as interest income over the lives of the related loans. For non-PCD loans, an initial ACL on loans is estimated and recorded as credit loss expense at the acquisition date.

The subsequent measurement of expected credit losses for all acquired loans is the same as the subsequent measurement of expected credit losses for originated loans.

ACL 
–
 Loans
 – Under the CECL model, the ACL on loans represents a valuation allowance estimated at each balance sheet date in accordance with GAAP that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to represent the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio.

Bancorp estimates the ACL on loans based on the underlying assets’ amortized cost basis, which is the amount at which the receivable is originated or acquired, adjusted for applicable accretion or amortization of premium, discount, and net deferred fees or costs, collection of payment, and partial charge-offs. In the event that collection of principal becomes uncertain, Bancorp has policies in place to reverse accrued interest in a timely manner. Therefore, Bancorp has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the measurement of the ACL on loans.

Expected credit losses are reflected in the ACL on loans through a charge to provision for credit losses on loans. When Bancorp deems all or a portion of a financial asset to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written-off and the ACL on loans is reduced by the same amount. Bancorp applies judgment to determine when a financial asset is deemed uncollectible; however, generally speaking, an asset will be considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts of collection have been exhausted and the collateral, if any, has been liquidated. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL on loans when received.

Bancorp’s methodologies for estimating the ACL on loans consider available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The methodologies apply historical loss information, adjusted for asset-specific characteristics, economic conditions at the measurement date, and forecasts about future economic conditions expected to exist through the contractual lives of the financial assets that are reasonable and supportable to the identified pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for which the historical loss experience was observed. Bancorp’s methodologies may revert to historical loss information on a straight-line basis over a number of quarters when it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts.

Loans are predominantly segmented by FDIC Call Report Codes into loan pools that have similar risk characteristics, similar collateral types and are assumed to pose consistent risk of loss to Bancorp. Bancorp has identified the following pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics for measuring expected credit losses:

Commercial Real Estate 
–
 Non-Owner Occupied 
–

Includes investment real estate loans secured by similar collateral as above. The primary source of income for this loan type is typically rental income associated with the property. This category also includes apartment or multifamily residential buildings (secured by five or more dwelling units).

Commercial Real Estate 
–
 Owner Occupied 
–

Includes non-farm, non-residential real estate loans for a variety of commercial property types and purposes, and is typically secured by commercial offices, industrial buildings, warehouses or retail buildings where the owner of the building occupies the property. The primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the party (or affiliate) who owns the property. Repayment terms vary considerably; interest rates are fixed or variable and structured for full or partial amortization of principal.

Commercial and Industrial 
–

Represents loans for C&I purposes to sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations and other business enterprises, whether secured (other than those that meet the definition of a “loan secured by real estate”) or unsecured, single payment or installment. This category includes loans originated for financing capital expenditures, loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory and other business assets such as equipment, non-real estate related construction loans in addition to non-real estate loans guaranteed by the SBA. Bancorp originates these loans for a variety of purposes across various industries. This portfolio has been segregated between term loans and revolving lines of credits based on the varied characteristics of these individual loan structures.

Residential Real Estate 
–

Includes non-revolving (closed-end) first and junior lien loans secured by residential real estate primarily in Bancorp’s market areas. This portfolio has been segregated between owner occupied and non-owner occupied status, as the investment nature of the latter poses additional credit risks to Bancorp.

87

Table of Contents

Construction and Land Development 
–

Consists of loans to finance the ground up construction or improvement of owner occupied and non-owner occupied residential and commercial properties and loans secured by raw or improved land. The repayment of C&D loans is generally dependent upon the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user, the leasing of the property, or sale of the property to a third party. Repayment of land secured loans is dependent upon the successful development and sale of the property, the sale of the land as is, or the outside cash flow of the owners to support the retirement of the debt. Bancorp’s construction loans may convert to real estate-secured loans once construction is completed or principal amortization payments begin, assuming the borrower retains financing with the Bank.

Home Equity Lines of Credit
 – Similar to residential real estate above, however these are revolving (open-ended) lines of credit.

Consumer 
–

Represents loans to individuals for personal expenditures that may be secured or unsecured. This includes pre-arranged overdraft plans, secured automobile loans and other consumer-purpose loans.

Leases 
–

Represents a variety of equipment leasing options to businesses.

Credit Cards 
–

Represents revolving short-term loans to businesses and, to a lesser extent, consumers.

Bancorp measures expected credit losses for its loan portfolio segments as follows:

Discounted Cash flow Method
 – The DCF methodology is used to develop cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speeds, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default and loss given default. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds, curtailment rates and time to recovery are based on historical internal data.

Bancorp uses regression analysis on historical internal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. This analysis also determines how expected probability of default and loss given default will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers. For all loan pools utilizing the DCF method, management utilizes a forecasted unemployment rate as its primary loss driver, as this was determined to best correlate to historical losses. Management has determined that four quarters represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period with reversion back to a historical loss rate over four quarters on a straight-line basis.

The combination of adjustments for credit expectations (default and loss) and timing expectations (prepayment, curtailment, and time to recovery) produces an expected cash flow stream at the instrument level. Instrument effective yield is calculated, net of the impacts of prepayment assumptions, and the instrument expected cash flows are then discounted at that effective yield to produce an instrument-level NPV of expected cash flows. An ACL is established for the difference between the instrument’s NPV and amortized cost basis.

88

Table of Contents

Static Pool Method
 – The static pool methodology is utilized for the loan portfolio segments that typically have shorter durations. For each of these loan segments, Bancorp applies an expected loss ratio based on historical losses adjusted as appropriate for qualitative loss factors. Qualitative loss factors are based on management's judgment of Company, market, industry or business specific data, changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality, delinquency, non-performing and adversely rated loans and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions.

Collateral Dependent Loans
 – Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. For collateral dependent loans where Bancorp has determined that the liquidation or foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and Bancorp expects repayment of the financial asset to be provided substantially through the operation of the business or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the asset as of the measurement date. When repayment is expected to be from the operation of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the financial asset exceeds the NPV of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected to be generated by the sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are calculated as the amount by which the amortized cost basis of the financial asset exceeds the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated cost to sell. The ACL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of loan. Bancorp’s estimate of the ACL reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the loan and the contractual term does not consider extensions, renewals or modifications.

Bancorp adopted ASU 2022-02, “
Financial Instruments 
–
 Credit Losses (Topic 326), Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures,
” effective January 1, 2023. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated the recognition and measure of troubled debt restructurings and enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

Premises and Equipment

–

Premises and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 
three
 to 
40
 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over terms of the related leases, including expected renewals, or over the useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major additions and improvements are capitalized.

Premises held for sale are carried at the lower of fair value or cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Premises held for sale represent properties owned by Bancorp that are currently listed for sale due mainly to location overlap and/or lack of necessity stemming from acquisition-related activity.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

– Goodwill resulting from business acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate a goodwill impairment test should be performed.

Bancorp has selected September 30
th
 as the date to perform its annual goodwill impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the Bank’s balance sheet.

Currently, goodwill recorded on Bancorp’s consolidated balance sheets is attributed mainly to the Commercial Banking segment, while a portion is also attributed to the WM&T segment. Goodwill related to the KSB acquisition is deductible for tax purposes, as it was structured as an asset sale/338 election. Goodwill related to the CB and KB acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes, as both were structured as stock sales. Based on its assessment, Bancorp believes its goodwill balances at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not impaired and are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

Other intangible assets consist of CDI and CLI assets arising from business acquisitions. The CDI and CLI assets represent customer relationships associated with acquired deposit portfolios and WM&T businesses, respectively. CDI and CLI assets are initially measured at fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives.

Other Assets

– BOLI and other life insurance policies are carried at net realizable value, which considers applicable surrender charges. Also, Bancorp maintains life insurance policies in conjunction with its non-qualified defined benefit and non-qualified compensation plans.

OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, establishing a new cost basis for the asset. OREO is subsequently carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value minus estimated selling costs. In certain situations, improvements to prepare assets for sale are capitalized if those costs increase the estimated fair value of the asset. Expenses incurred in maintaining assets, write downs to reflect subsequent declines in value, and realized gains or losses are reflected in the results of operations and are included in non-interest income and/or expense.

Bancorp periodically invests in certain partnerships that generate federal income tax credits. The tax benefit of these investments exceeds the amortization expense associated with them, resulting in a positive impact on net income. In addition to income tax benefits, these investments also serve as an economical means of achieving CRA goals. The investments in such partnerships are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, while the corresponding contribution requirements are recorded in other liabilities. While contributions are made periodically over the life of the respective investments, which can be up to 10 years depending on the type of investment, the majority of contributions associated with a respective investment are made within the first few years after entering the partnership.

Effective January 1, 2024, Bancorp adopted ASU 2023-02, “
Investments 
–
 Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.
” As a result, all of Bancorp’s investments in tax credit partnerships are now accounted for under the proportional amortization method, with related amortization expense recorded within income tax expense on the condensed consolidated income statements. Prior to 2024, Bancorp used both the effective yield and the proportional amortization methods to account for these investments, with related amortization expense recorded as a component of non-interest expenses on the condensed consolidated income statements. The adoption of this ASU resulted in a one-time $
2.5
 million increase in retained earnings, which was recorded at the date of adoption.

Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures
 – Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to originate loans, commitments to fund existing loans and commercial letters of credit issued to meet customer-financing needs. Off-balance sheet refers to assets or liabilities that do not appear on a company's balance sheet. Bancorp’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for off-balance sheet loan commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.

Bancorp records an ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures, unless the commitments to extend credit are unconditionally cancelable, through a charge to credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures included in provision for credit losses on Bancorp’s consolidated statements of income. The ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated by loan portfolio segment at each balance sheet date under the current CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur and is included in other liabilities on Bancorp’s consolidated balance sheets.

Derivatives

– Bancorp uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, as part of its interest rate risk management. GAAP establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. As required by GAAP, Bancorp’s interest rate swaps are recognized as other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Accounting for changes in fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. To qualify for hedge accounting, Bancorp must comply with detailed rules and documentation requirements at inception of the hedge, and hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of each hedging relationship. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is measured periodically throughout the life of the hedging relationship.

For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative is initially reported in OCI and subsequently reclassified to interest income or expense when the hedged transaction affects earnings, while the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivative, if any, is recognized immediately in other noninterest income. Bancorp assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing cumulative changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with cumulative changes in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. No component of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

90

Table of Contents

Periodically, Bancorp enters into an interest rate swap transaction with a borrower, who desires to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. Because of matching terms of offsetting contracts and collateral provisions mitigating any non-performance risk, changes in fair value subsequent to initial recognition have an insignificant effect on earnings. Because these derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments, the derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value, due to changes in prevailing interest rates, recorded in other noninterest income.

Bancorp had no fair value hedging relationships at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Bancorp does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See the footnote titled “
Derivative Financial Instruments
” for additional discussion.

Transfers of Financial Assets

–

Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from Bancorp, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and Bancorp does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.

Stock-Based Compensation

– For all awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period in which it is earned based on the grant-date fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant. GAAP requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

– Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in DTAs and DTLs. DTAs and DTLs are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted statutory tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces DTAs to the amount expected to be realized.

A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more-likely-than-not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more-likely-than-not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.

Bancorp recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense, if any.

Bancorp periodically invests in certain partnerships with customers that yield historic tax credits. The tax benefit of these investments exceeds the amortization expense associated with them, resulting in a positive impact on net income. Effective January 1, 2024, Bancorp adopted ASU 2023-02, “

Prior to 2024, Bancorp used both the effective yield and the proportional amortization methods to account for these investments, with related amortization expense recorded as a component of non-interest expenses on the condensed consolidated income statements.

Net Income Per Share
 –

Basic net income per common share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income per share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the weighted average number of shares that would be issued upon exercise of dilutive options and SARs, assuming proceeds are used to repurchase shares under the treasury stock method.

Table of Contents

Comprehensive Income (Loss)
 –

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from outside of the Company’s control. For Bancorp, this includes net income, changes in unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt securities and cash flow hedging instruments, net of reclassification adjustments and taxes, and minimum pension liability adjustments, net of taxes.

Loss Contingencies

– Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable, and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any outstanding matters that would have a material effect on the financial statements.

Restrictions on Cash and Cash Equivalents

– Bancorp has historically been required by the FRB to maintain average reserve balances. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced the reserve requirement ratio to 0% in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, eliminating reserve requirements for all depository institutions. The reserve requirement ratio remained at 0% as of December 31, 2024.

Dividend Restriction

– Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the Holding Company or by the Holding Company to shareholders.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

–

Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as disclosed in footnote titled “
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value

Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect such estimates.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

– The majority of Bancorp’s revenue comes from interest income and other sources, including loans, leases, securities, and derivatives, which are not subject to ASC 606. Bancorp’s services that fall within the scope of ASC 606 are presented within non-interest income and are recognized as revenue as Bancorp satisfies its obligation to its customer.

Segment Information

–

Bancorp provides a broad range of financial services to individuals, corporations and others through its full service banking locations. These services include loan and deposit services, cash management services, securities brokerage activities, mortgage origination and WM&T activities. Bancorp’s operations are considered by management to be aggregated in two reportable operating segments: Commercial Banking and WM&T, as disclosed in footnote titled “
Segments.

Adoption of New Accounting Guidance

–

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, “
Investments 
–
 Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.
”

The amendments in this update permits reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met, regardless of the tax credit program from which the related income tax credits are received. The amendments allow for making the election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis, as opposed to applying this method at the reporting entity level or to individual investments. Further, the amendments of this ASU removed certain guidance for Qualified Affordable Housing Project investments and require the application of the delayed equity contribution guidance to all tax equity investments. The amendments of this ASU became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.
”

The amendments in this update improved financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The amendments in this update did not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The amendments of this ASU became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements

Accounting Standards Updates

–

Generally, if an issued but not yet effective ASU with an expected immaterial impact to Bancorp has been disclosed in prior SEC filings, it will not be re-disclosed.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “
Income Statement 
–
 Reporting Comprehensive Income 
–
 Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.
”

This update requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities. New financial statement disclosures are required in tabular format, disaggregating information about prescribed categories underlying any relevant income statement expense caption. The prescribed categories include, among other things, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. Additionally, entities must disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Bancorp is evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
”

The amendments in this update address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures, primarily related to effective tax rate reconciliation and information related to income taxes paid, among certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of such disclosures. The amendments of this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and are to be applied on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.

(
2) Cash and Due from Banks

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Bancorp’s interest-bearing cash accounts and non-interest bearing deposits held at other financial institutions exceeded the $250,000 federally insured limits by approximately $
3
 million and $
5
 million, respectively. Each correspondent bank’s financial performance and market rating are reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure Bancorp maintains deposits only at highly rated institutions, providing minimal risk for those exceeding federally insured limits. Bancorp had approximately $
219
 million and $
170
 million held cumulatively at the FRB and FHLB as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which are government-sponsored entities not insured by the FDIC. The vast majority of these balances were held at the FRB.

Bancorp has historically been required to maintain an average reserve balance in cash or with the FRB relating to customer deposits. However, effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced the requirement ratio to 0% in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, eliminating the reserve requirements for all depository institutions. The reserve requirement remained at 0% as of December 31, 2024.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. The investment portfolio includes MBS, which are guaranteed by agencies such as FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA. These securities differ from traditional debt securities primarily in that they may have uncertain principal payment dates and are priced based on estimated prepayment rates on the underlying collateral.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no holdings of debt securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity.

Accrued interest on the investment securities portfolio (AFS and HTM) totaled $
5
 million and $
6
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was included in the consolidated balance sheets.

No
 gains or losses on sales or calls of securities were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result of the dissolution of the Captive during the fourth quarter of 2023, a loss totaling $
44,000
 on the sale of AFS treasury securities held by the Captive was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Securities with a carrying value of $
852
 million and $
991
 million were pledged at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to secure accounts of commercial depositors in cash management accounts, public deposits and uninsured cash balances for WM&T accounts.

Based on an evaluation of available information including security type, counterparty credit quality, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are relevant to collectability, Bancorp has concluded that it expects to receive all contractual cash flows from each security held in its AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio. As such, 
no
 allowance or impairment was recorded with respect to investment securities as of December 31, 2024.

Table of Contents

Applicable dates for determining when securities are in an unrealized loss position are December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As such, it is possible that a security had a market value lower than its amortized cost on other days during the past 12 months, but is not in the “
Less than 12 months
” category in the preceding table.

For debt securities with unrealized and unrecognized loss positions, Bancorp evaluates the securities to determine whether the decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis (impairment) is due to credit-related factors or non-credit related factors. Any impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in AOCI, net of tax. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an a ACL for debt securities on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Both the ACL and the adjustment to net income may be reversed if conditions change. However, if Bancorp intends to sell an impaired debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell such a security before recovering its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment amount would be recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Because the security’s amortized cost basis is adjusted to fair value, there is no ACL in this situation.

In evaluating debt securities in unrealized and unrecognized loss positions for impairment and the criteria regarding its intent or requirement to sell such securities, Bancorp considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuers’ financial condition, among other factors. Unrealized and unrecognized losses on Bancorp’s investment securities portfolio have not been recognized as an expense because the securities are of high credit quality, and the decline in fair values is attributable to changes in the prevailing interest rate environment since the purchase date. Fair value is expected to recover as securities reach maturity and/or the interest rate environment returns to conditions similar to when these securities were purchased. These investments consisted of 
488
 and 
498
 separate investment positions as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. By dollar value, approximately 
86
% and 
98
% of the portfolio was in a loss position as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were no credit related factors underlying unrealized and unrecognized losses on debt securities at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Total loans are presented inclusive of premiums, discounts and net loan origination fees and costs.

Fees and costs of originating loans are deferred at origination and amortized over the life of the loan. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, net deferred loan origination fees exceeded deferred loan origination costs, resulting in a net reduction of loan balances totaling $
3
 million and $
2
 million, respectively.

Bancorp’s credit exposure is diversified with secured and unsecured loans to individuals and businesses. No specific industry concentration exceeds 10% of loans outstanding. While Bancorp has a diversified loan portfolio, a customer’s ability to honor contracts is somewhat dependent upon the economic stability and/or industry in which that customer does business. Loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments are primarily concentrated within Bancorp’s current market areas, which encompass Louisville, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan markets.

Bancorp occasionally enters into loan participation agreements with other banks in the ordinary course of business to diversify credit risk. For certain sold participation loans, Bancorp has retained effective control of the loans, typically by restricting the participating institutions from pledging or selling their share of the loan without permission from Bancorp. GAAP requires the participated portion of these loans to be recorded as secured borrowings. The participated portions of these loans are included in the C&I totals above with a corresponding liability reflected in other liabilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total participated portions of loans of this nature totaled $
2
 million and $
4
 million, respectively.

Accrued interest
 on loans, which is excluded from the amortized cost of loans, totaled $
23
 million and $
21
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was included in the consolidated balance sheets.

Loans with carrying amounts of $
3.48
 billion and $
3.15
 billion were pledged to secure FHLB borrowing capacity at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents

Loan Risk Ratings

Consistent with regulatory guidance, Bancorp categorizes loans into credit risk rating categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends. Pass-rated loans include all risk-rated loans other than those classified as OAEM, substandard, and doubtful, which are defined below:

OAEM
 – Loans classified as OAEM have potential weaknesses requiring management's heightened attention. These potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects for the loan or of Bancorp's credit position at some future date.

Substandard 
– Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the paying capacity of the obligor or of collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize ultimate repayment of the debt. Default is a distinct possibility if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Substandard non-performing
 – Loans classified as substandard non-performing have all the characteristics of substandard loans and have been placed on non-accrual status. Loans are usually placed on non-accrual status when prospects for recovering both principal and accrued interest are considered doubtful or when a default of principal or interest has existed for 90 days or more.

Doubtful
 – Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. A loan is typically charged off once it is classified as doubtful.

Management considers the guidance in ASC 310-20 when determining whether a modification, extension, or renewal of loan constitutes a current period origination. Current period renewals of credit are re-underwritten at the point of renewal and considered current period originations for purposes of the table below. Bancorp has elected not to disclose revolving loans that have converted to term loans, as activity relating to this disclosure, which is included in the tables is currently immaterial to Bancorp’s loan portfolio and is expected to be in the future.

Depreciation expense related to premises and equipment was $

6.5
 million in 2022, respectively.

Premises and equipment are presented on the consolidated balance sheets net of related depreciation on the respective assets as well as fair value adjustments associated with purchase accounting. As of December 31, 2024, Bancorp’s branch network consists of 72 locations throughout Louisville, central, eastern and northern, Kentucky, as well as the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio markets.

In addition to the premises and equipment detailed above, premises held for sale totaling $
2.3
 million was also recorded on Bancorp’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, which consists of three undeveloped parcels of land, a former administrative building and one former branch location.

Bancorp has operating leases (land and building) for various locations with terms ranging from approximately 
three
 months to 
24
 years, several of which include options to extend the leases in five-year increments. Options reasonably expected to be exercised are included in determination of the right-of-use asset. Bancorp elected to use a practical expedient to expense short-term lease obligations associated with leases with original terms of 12 months or less. Bancorp elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components for its operating leases. The right-of-use lease asset and operating lease liability are recorded in premises and equipment and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

Note: The acquisition of The Bank Oldham County in 2013 resulted in a bargain purchase gain.

GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Bancorp’s annual goodwill impairment test is conducted as of September 30 of each year or more often as situations dictate.

At September 30, 2024, Bancorp elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was not more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of the reporting units exceeded their fair value.

Bancorp periodically invests in certain partnerships that generate federal income tax credits. The tax benefit of these investments exceeds the amortization expense associated with them, resulting in a positive impact on net income. The investments in such partnerships are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, while the corresponding contribution requirements are recorded in other liabilities. For additional information, see footnote titled “
Income Taxes.
”

Bancorp enters into interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated derivative instruments and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For additional information, see footnote titled “
Derivative Financial Instruments.

On April 10, 2023, the IRS issued a proposed regulation that would potentially classify section 831(b) captive activity as a “listed transaction,” and disallow the related tax benefits, both prospectively and retroactively. The regulation was finalized in January 2025 and its impact is being evaluated by management. Bancorp elected not to renew the insurance captive effective August 2023 and it was dissolved as of December 31, 2023.

GAAP provides guidance on financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns. If recognized, tax benefits would reduce tax expense and accordingly, increase net income. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current year tax positions, expiration of open income tax returns due to statutes of limitation, changes in management’s judgment about the level of uncertainty, status of examination, litigation and legislative activity and addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial to Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. Federal income tax returns are subject to examination for the years after 
2020
 and state income tax returns are subject to examination for the years after 
2019

A valuation allowance is recognized for a DTA if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire DTA will not be realized. Ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers scheduled reversal of DTLs, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projection for future taxable income over periods which the temporary differences resulting in remaining DTAs are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that Bancorp will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31, 2024.

Realization of DTAs/DTLs associated with investment in tax credit partnerships is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable capital gain income prior to their expiration. 
No
 valuation allowance was recorded as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023 based on management’s estimate of the temporary deductible differences that may expire prior to their utilization.

Bancorp periodically invests in certain partnerships that generate federal income tax credits. The tax benefit of these investments exceeds the amortization expense associated with them, resulting in a positive impact on net income. In addition to income tax benefits, these investments also serve as an economical means of achieving CRA goals. The investments in such partnerships are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, while the corresponding contribution requirements are recorded in other liabilities. While contributions are made periodically over the life of the respective investments, which can be up to 10 years depending on the type of investment, the majority of contributions associated with a respective investment are made within the first few years after entering the partnership.

Bancorp’s investments in tax credit partnerships, including the related unfunded contributions, totaled $
185
 million and $
175
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in 
other assets
 on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2024, Bancorp’s expected payments for unfunded contributions related to investments in tax credit partnerships, which are accrued and included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were as follows:

Investments 
–
 Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.
” As a result, all of Bancorp’s investments in tax credit partnerships are now accounted for under the proportional amortization method, with related amortization expense recorded within income tax expense on the condensed consolidated income statements. Prior to 2024, Bancorp used both the effective yield and the proportional amortization methods to account for these investments, with related amortization expense recorded as a component of non-interest expenses on the condensed consolidated income statements.

(12) Subordinated Debentures 

As a result of its acquisition of Commonwealth Bancshares, Inc. on March 7, 2022, Bancorp became the 
100
% successor owner of the following unconsolidated trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS. The TPS are treated as part of Tier I Capital. The subordinated notes and related interest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. The subordinated notes are currently redeemable at Bancorp’s option on a quarterly basis. The carrying values of the subordinated notes were adjusted to fair value at acquisition date. The related discounts on the subordinated notes are amortized and recognized as a component of interest expense in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. Bancorp chose not to redeem the subordinated notes on January 1, 2025 and carried the notes at the costs noted below at December 31, 2024.

(13) FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings

FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2024 consisted of a rolling $
300
 million three-month advance that matures in February 2025, which Bancorp utilizes in conjunction with interest rate swaps in an effort to hedge cash flows. FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2023 consisted of a $
200
 million three-month advance that matured in early 2024, which was also utilized in conjunction with the previously mentioned interest rate swaps.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, gross proceeds and repayments related to FHLB advances totaled $
2.80
 billion and $
2.70
 billion, respectively. Net proceeds and repayments related to FHLB advances (excluding those with maturities of 90 days or less) totaled $
1
 billion and $
900
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, gross proceeds and repayments related to FHLB advances totaled $
2.40
 billion and $
2.25
 billion, respectively. Net proceeds and repayments related to FHLB advances (excluding those with maturities of 90 days or less) totaled $

FHLB advances are collateralized by certain CRE and residential real estate mortgage loans under blanket mortgage collateral pledge agreements. Bancorp views these advances as an effective lower-costing alternative to brokered deposits to fund loan growth. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of available credit from the FHLB totaled $
1.25
 billion and $
1.33
 billion, respectively.

Bancorp also had $
80
 million in FFP lines available from correspondent banks at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

(17) Employee Benefit Plans

Bancorp has a combined employee stock ownership and defined contribution plan. The plan is available to all employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. In general, for employees who work more than 1,000 hours per year, Bancorp matches employee contributions up to 
6
% of the employee’s salary and contributes an amount of Bancorp stock equal to 
2
% of the employee’s salary. Employer matching expenses related to contributions to the plan for 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $
5.1
 million, $
4.5
 million and $
4.2
 million and are recorded on the consolidated statements of income within employee benefits. Employee and employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of the plan. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the KSOP held 
405,000
 and 
427,000
 shares of Bancorp stock, respectively.

In addition, Bancorp has non-qualified plans into which directors and certain senior officers may defer director fees or salary/incentives. Bancorp matched certain executives’ deferrals into the senior officers’ plan amounting to approximately $
323,000
, $
296,000
 and $
221,000
 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amounts included in other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements for this plan totaled $
12
 million, respectively. The total was comprised primarily of participants’ contributions and represented the fair value of mutual fund investments directed by plan participants.

Bancorp sponsors an unfunded, non-qualified, defined benefit retirement plan for 
two
 retired officers and has no plans to increase the number of or the benefits to participants. All participants are fully vested based on 
25
 years of service. Bancorp uses a December 31 measurement date for this plan. The accumulated benefit obligation for the plan included in other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements was $
2.3
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Actuarially determined pension costs are expensed and accrued over the service period and benefits are paid from Bancorp’s assets. Bancorp maintains life insurance policies, for which it is the beneficiary, for defined benefit plan participants and certain former executives. Income from these policies serves to offset costs of benefits. The liability for Bancorp’s plan met the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Net periodic benefit cost was immaterial for all periods.

(18) Stock-Based Compensation

The fair value of all stock-based awards granted, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized as compensation expense over the respective service period.

At Bancorp's 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders approved the 2015 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan and authorized the shares available from the expiring 2005 plan for future awards under the 2015 plan. In 2018, shareholders approved an additional 
500,000
 shares for issuance under the plan. Shareholders approved an additional 1 million shares for issuance under the plan at Bancorp’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 25, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
1
 million shares available for future awards. The 2015 Stock Incentive Plan has no defined expiration date.

SAR Grants 
– SARs granted have a vesting schedule of 
20
% per year and expire 
ten
 years after the grant date unless forfeited due to termination of employment.

Fair values of SARs are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, a leading formula for calculating such value. The model requires the input of assumptions, changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate. The following assumptions were used in SAR valuations at the grant date in each year:

2024

2023

2022

Dividend yield

2.29

%

2.24

%

Risk free interest rate

4.16

%

3.84

%

1.98

%

Expected life (in years)

7.1

7.1

7.1

Dividend yield and expected volatility are based on historical information for Bancorp corresponding to the expected life of SARs granted. Expected volatility is the volatility of underlying shares for the expected term calculated on a monthly basis. The risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the awards. The expected life of SARs is based on historic experience of past like-term SARs. Bancorp evaluates historical exercise and post-vesting termination behavior when determining the expected life.

RSA Grants 
– RSAs granted to officers vest over 
five
 years. For all grants prior to 2015, grantees are entitled to dividend payments during the vesting period. The fair value of RSAs is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant.

PSU Grants 
– PSUs vest based upon service and a 
three
-year performance period, which begins January 1 of the first year of the performance period. Because grantees are not entitled to dividend payments during the performance period, the fair value of these PSUs is estimated based upon the market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant, adjusted for non-payment of dividends. PSUs require a 
one
 year post-vesting holding period and the fair value of such grants incorporates a liquidity discount related to the holding period of 
5.8
%, 
5.2
% and 
5.8
% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

RSU Grants 
– RSUs are only granted to non-employee directors, are time-based and vest 
12
 months after grant date. Because grantees are entitled to deferred dividend payments at the end of the vesting period, the fair value of the RSUs equals market value of underlying shares on the date of grant.

In the first quarters of 2024 and 2023, Bancorp awarded 
9,550
 and 
8,668
 RSUs to non-employee directors of Bancorp with a grant date fair value of $
500,000
 and $
550,000
, respectively.

Bancorp utilized cash of $
203,000
 and $
175,000
 during 2024 and 2023, respectively, for the purchase of shares upon the vesting of RSUs.

Most commitments to extend credit are an agreement to lend to a customer either unsecured or secured, as long as collateral is available as agreed upon and there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not represent future cash requirements. Bancorp uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional guarantees as for on-balance sheet instruments. Bancorp evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, securities, equipment and real estate. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.

The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures, which is separate from the ACL for loans and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, was $
6.8
 million and $
5.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Provision expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $
925,000
 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven largely by an increase in estimated future utilization within the C&D portfolio. Provision expense for off balance sheet credit exposures of $
1.3
 million and $
575,000
 was recorded the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Bancorp to guarantee the performance of a customer to a first party beneficiary. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support commercial transactions. Standby letters of credit generally have maturities of 
one
 to 
two
 years.

Certain commercial customers require confirmation of Bancorp’s letters of credit by other banks since Bancorp does not have a rating by a national rating agency. Terms of the agreements range from one month to a year with certain agreements requiring between one and six months’ notice to cancel. If an event of default on all contracts had occurred at December 31, 2024, Bancorp would have been required to make payments of approximately $
4
 million, which is the maximum amount payable under those contracts. No payments have ever been required because of default on these contracts. These agreements are normally secured by collateral acceptable to Bancorp, which limits credit risk associated with the agreements.

Bancorp periodically invests in certain partnerships that generate federal income tax credits, which result in contribution commitments. Such commitments are recorded in Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While contributions are made periodically over the life of the respective investments, which can be up to 10 years depending on the type of investment, the majority of contributions associated with a respective investment are made within the first few years after entering the partnership. Bancorp invested in several larger tax credit partnerships during 2023, which served as an economical means of fulfilling CRA goals. As of December 31, 2024, tax credit contribution commitments of $
147
 million were recorded in Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2024, in the normal course of business, there were pending legal actions and proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted. Management, after discussion with legal counsel, believes the ultimate result of these legal actions and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Bancorp.

(21) Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value

Fair value represents the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:

Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.

Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

Authoritative guidance requires maximization of use of observable inputs and minimization of use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. Where there exists limited or no observable market data, Bancorp derives its own estimates by generally considering characteristics of the asset/liability, the current economic and competitive environment and other factors. For this reason, results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized on an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability.

Bancorp used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value of each type of financial instrument:

AFS debt securities - 
Except for Bancorp’s U.S Treasury securities, the fair value of AFS debt securities is typically determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). Bancorp’s U.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government obligation securities are based on quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs).

Mortgage loans held for sale
 - The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is determined using quoted secondary market prices (Level 2 inputs).

Mortgage banking derivatives
 – Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist primarily of interest rate lock loan commitments and mandatory forward sales contracts. The fair value of Bancorp’s derivative instruments is primarily measured by obtaining pricing from broker-dealers recognized to be market participants. The pricing is derived from observable market inputs that can generally be verified and do not typically involve significant judgement by Bancorp (Level 2 inputs).

Interest rate swap agreements
 – Interest rate swaps are valued using valuations received from the relevant dealer counterparty. These valuations consider multiple observable market inputs, including interest rate yield curves, time value and volatility factors (Level 2 inputs).

Bancorp had no financial instruments classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 or 2023. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during 2024 or 2023. 

For the securities portfolio, Bancorp monitors the valuation technique used by pricing agencies to ascertain when transfers between levels have occurred. The nature of other assets and liabilities measured at fair value is such that transfers in and out of any level are expected to be rare. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3.

Table of Contents

Discussion of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis follows:

Collateral dependent loans
 – For collateral-dependent loans where Bancorp has determined that the liquidation or foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the estimated fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For real estate loans, fair value of the loan’s collateral is determined by third party or internal appraisals, which are then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral. For this asset class, the actual valuation methods (income, comparable sales, or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on the individual assets with no one of the three methods being the predominant approach. Bancorp reviews the third party appraisal for appropriateness and adjusts the value to consider selling and closing costs, which typically range from 
8
% to 
10
% of the appraised value. For non-real estate loans, fair value of the loan’s collateral may be determined using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation and management’s expertise or knowledge of the client and client’s business.

OREO 
–

OREO is primarily comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans. OREO is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling and closing costs at the date of transfer, with any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs charged to the ACL. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded against earnings. Bancorp obtains the valuation of OREO with material balances from third party appraisers. For this asset class, the actual valuation methods (income, sales comparable, or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property. The unobservable inputs may vary depending on the individual assets with no one of the three methods being the predominant approach. Bancorp reviews the appraisal for appropriateness and adjusts the value to consider selling and closing costs, which typically range from 
8
% to 
10
% of the appraised value.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about financial instruments. Because no market exists for a significant portion of Bancorp’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, calculated fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument. Changes in assumptions could significantly impact estimates.

MSRs, a component of other assets, are initially recognized at fair value when mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained. The MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income, considering appropriate prepayment assumptions. MSRs are evaluated quarterly for impairment by comparing carrying value to fair value. Fair value is based on a valuation model that calculates the PV of estimated net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as estimated prepayment speeds and discount rates.

136

Table of Contents

The estimated fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $
25
 million and $
24
 million, respectively. There was 
no
 valuation allowance recorded for MSRs as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as fair value exceeded carrying value. The fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2024 was determined using discount rates ranging from 
10.0
% to 
13.0
%, prepayment speeds ranging from 
5.3
% to 
10.5
%, depending on the characteristics of the specific rights (rate, maturity, etc.), and a weighted average default rate of 
0.6
%. The fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2023 was determined using discount rates ranging from 
10.0
% to 
13.0
%, prepayment speeds ranging from 
6.0
% to 
11.1
%, depending on the characteristics of the specific rights, and a weighted average default rate of 
0.6
%.

Total outstanding principal balances of loans serviced for others were $
1.82
 billion and $
1.93
 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist primarily of mandatory forward sales contracts and interest rate lock loan commitments. Mandatory forward contracts represent future loan commitments to deliver loans at a specified price and date and are used to manage interest rate risk on loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Interest rate lock loan commitments represent commitments to fund loans at a specific rate. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to transfer risk. Substantially all of these instruments expire within 90 days from the date of issuance. Notional amounts are amounts on which calculations and payments are based, but which do not represent credit exposure, as credit exposure is limited to the amount required to be received or paid.

Mandatory forward contracts contain an element of risk in that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In the event the counterparties fail to deliver commitments or are unable to fulfill their obligations, the Bank could potentially incur significant additional costs by replacing the positions at then current market rates. The Bank manages its risk of exposure by limiting counterparties to those banks and institutions deemed appropriate by management. The Bank does not expect any counterparty to default on their obligations and therefore, the Bank does not expect to incur any cost related to counterparty default.

The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk on loans held for sale and rate lock loan commitments. As market interest rates fluctuate, the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and rate lock commitments will fluctuate. To offset this interest rate risk, the Bank enters into derivatives, such as mandatory forward contracts to sell loans. The fair value of these mandatory forward contracts will fluctuate as market interest rates fluctuate, and the change in the value of these instruments is expected to largely, though not entirely, offset the change in fair value of loans held for sale and rate lock commitments. The objective of this activity is to minimize the exposure to losses on rate lock loan commitments and loans held for sale due to market interest rate fluctuations. The net effect of derivatives on earnings will depend on risk management activities and a variety of other factors, including: market interest rate volatility; the amount of rate lock commitments that close; the ability to fill the forward contracts before expiration; and the time period required to close and sell loans.

The following table includes the notional amounts and fair values of mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage banking derivatives:

(24) Derivative Financial Instruments

Periodically, Bancorp enters into interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated derivative instruments and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Because of matching terms of offsetting contracts and collateral provisions mitigating any non-performance risk, changes in fair value subsequent to initial recognition have an insignificant effect on earnings. Exchanges of cash flows related to undesignated interest rate swap agreements were offsetting and therefore had no effect on Bancorp’s earnings or cash flows.

Interest rate swap agreements derive their value from underlying interest rates. These transactions involve both credit and market risk. Notional amounts are amounts on which calculations, payments and the value of the derivative are based. Notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures. Direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid, if any. Bancorp is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these agreements. Bancorp mitigates the credit risk of its financial contracts through credit approvals, collateral and monitoring procedures, and does not expect any counterparties to fail their obligations.

Bancorp had outstanding undesignated interest rate swap contracts as follows:

During the first quarter of 2023, Bancorp entered into an interest rate swap to hedge cash flows of a $
100
 million rolling fixed-rate three-month FHLB borrowing. The swap began February 6, 2023 and matures February 6, 2028. During the third quarter of 2023, Bancorp entered into two additional interest rate swaps to hedge cash flows of two $
50
 million rolling fixed-rate three-month FHLB borrowings. These swaps began August 7, 2023, with one maturing August 6, 2026 and the other maturing August 6, 2028. During the third quarter of 2024, Bancorp entered into another interest rate swap to hedge cash flows of a $
100
 million rolling fixed-rate three-month FHLB borrowing. The swap began on August 6, 2024 and matures on August 6, 2029.

While Bancorp expects to utilize fixed-rate three-month FHLB advances with respect to these interest rate swaps, brokered CDs or other fixed rate advances may be utilized for the same three-month terms instead should those sources be more favorable. For purposes of hedging, rolling fixed rate advances are considered to be floating rate liabilities.

Interest rate swaps involve exchange of Bancorp’s floating rate interest payments for fixed rate swap payments on underlying principal amounts. These swaps were designated and qualified, for cash-flow hedge accounting. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported as a component of AOCI, and is subsequently reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in periods for which the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings.

(25) Regulatory Matters

Bancorp and the Bank are subject to capital regulations in accordance with Basel III, as administered by banking regulators. Regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements, in part, dependent on the individual risk profiles of financial institutions. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Bancorp’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Holding Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of Bancorp’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors.

Banking regulators have categorized the Bank as well-capitalized. To meet the definition of well-capitalized, a bank must have a minimum 
6.5
% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 
8.0
% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 
10.0
% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio and 
5.0
% Tier 1 Leverage ratio.

Additionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, Bancorp and the Bank must hold a 
2.5
% capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for the Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital ratio necessary to be considered adequately-capitalized. At December 31, 2024, the adequately-capitalized minimums, including the capital conservation buffer, were a 
7.0
% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 
8.5
% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and 
10.5
% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio.

As a result of the CB acquisition, Bancorp became the 
100
% successor owner of the following unconsolidated trust subsidiaries: Commonwealth Statutory Trust III, Commonwealth Statutory Trust IV and Commonwealth Statutory Trust V. The sole assets of the trust subsidiaries represent the proceeds of offerings loaned in exchange for subordinated debentures with similar terms to the TPS. The TPS are treated as part of Tier 1 Capital. The subordinated note and related interest expense are included in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. The subordinated notes are currently redeemable at Bancorp’s option on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2024, subordinated notes added through the CB acquisition totaled $
27
 million.

Bancorp continues to exceed the regulatory requirements for all calculations. Bancorp and the Bank intend to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the “well-capitalized” requirements as defined by the FRB and the FDIC, in addition to the capital conservation buffer.

(27) Segments

Bancorp’s principal activities are divided into two reportable segments, Commercial Banking and WM&T, which are delineated based on the products and services that each segment offers:

Commercial Banking provides a full range of loan and deposit products to individual consumers and businesses through retail lending, mortgage banking, deposit services, online banking, mobile banking, private banking, commercial lending, commercial real estate lending, leasing, treasury management services, merchant services, international banking, correspondent banking, credit card services, and other banking services. Bancorp also offers securities brokerage services via its banking center network through an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer in the Commercial Banking segment. 

WM&T provides investment management, financial & retirement planning and trust & estate services, as well as retirement plan management for businesses and corporations in all markets in which Bancorp operates. The magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community banks of similar asset size.

142

Table of Contents

Bancorp’s Commercial Banking and WM&T segments overlap a regional reporting structure. These regions are based on the primary geographic markets in which Bancorp operates, specifically Louisville, central, eastern and northern Kentucky, and the Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio MSAs. All regions share the same lines of business, including the same products, services and delivery methods, as well as similar customer bases and pricing guidelines.

Financial information for each business segment reflects that which is specifically identifiable or allocated based on an internal allocation method. Income taxes are allocated based on the effective federal income tax rate adjusted for any tax-exempt activity. All tax-exempt activity and provision have been allocated fully to the commercial banking segment. Measurement of performance of business segments is based on the management structure of Bancorp and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Information presented is also not necessarily indicative of the segments’ operations if they were independent entities.

Bancorp’s chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker. The financial results by operating segment, including significant expense categories provided to the chief operating decision maker, help measure the profitability of a particular segment and identify trends, evaluate each segment and its impact on consolidated earnings, and enhance decision making processes related to the allocation of Bancorp’s resources.

The majority of the net assets of Bancorp are associated with in the Commercial Banking segment. As of December 31, 2024, goodwill totaling $
194
 million was recorded on Bancorp’s consolidated balance sheets, of which $
172
 million is attributed to the commercial banking segment and $
22
 million is attributed to WM&T. The portion of total goodwill attributed to WM&T relates entirely to the CB acquisition, which generated $
67
 million in total goodwill, $
8.5
 million of which was subsequently written off as a result of Bancorp selling its interest in LFA effective December 31, 2022. With the exception of goodwill attributed to WM&T through the CB acquisition, assets assigned to WM&T consist primarily of a CLI asset associated with the WM&T business added through the CB acquisition, net premises and equipment and a receivable related to fees earned that have not been collected.

WM&T AUM, which the primary driver of WM&T revenue, are not included on the consolidated balance sheets of Bancorp. WM&T AUM totaled $
7.07
 billion, $
7.16
 billion and $
6.59
 billion as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Financial results by operating segment, including significant expense categories provided to the chief operating decision maker, are detailed below:

Table of Contents

Bancorp’s revenue on the consolidated statement of income is categorized by product type, which effectively depicts how the nature, timing and extent of cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenue sources within the scope of ASC 606 are discussed below:

Bancorp earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account management and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payments fees and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed, as that is when the company fulfills the performance obligation. Account management fees are earned over the course of a month and charged in the month in which the services are provided.

Treasury management transaction fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed, as that is when the company fulfills the performance obligation. Account analysis fees are earned over the course of a month and charged in the month in which the services are provided. Treasury management fees are withdrawn from customers’ account balances.

WM&T provides customers fiduciary and investment management services as agreed upon in asset management contracts. The contracts require WM&T to provide a series of distinct services for which fees are earned over time. The contracts are cancellable upon demand with fees typically based upon the asset value of investments. Revenue is accrued and recognized monthly based upon month-end asset values and collected from the customer predominately in the following month except for a small percentage of fees collected quarterly. Incentive compensation related to WM&T activities is considered a cost of obtaining the contract. Contracts between WM&T and customers do not permit performance-based fees and accordingly, none of the fee income earned by WM&T is performance-based. Trust fees receivable totaled $
4.5
 million and $
4.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Net investment products sales commissions and fees represent the Bank’s share of transaction fees and wrap fees resulting from investment services and programs provided through an agent relationship with a third party broker-dealer. Transaction fees are assessed at the time of the transaction. Those fees are collected and recognized on a monthly basis. Trailing fees are based upon market values and are assessed, collected and recognized on a quarterly basis. Because the Bank acts as an agent in arranging the relationship between the customer and third party provider, and does not control the services rendered, investment product sales commissions and fees are reported net of related costs, including nominal incentive compensation, and trading activity charges of $
968,000
 and $
883,000
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Debit and credit card revenue primarily consists of debit and credit card interchange income. Interchange income represents fees assessed within the payment card system for acceptance of card-based transactions. Interchange fees are assessed as the performance obligation is satisfied, which is at the point in time the card transaction is authorized. Revenue is collected and recognized daily through the payment network settlement process.

Bancorp did 
not
 establish any contract assets or liabilities as a result of adopting ASC 606, nor were any recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Stockholders, Board of Directors, and Audit Committee

Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc.

Louisville, Kentucky

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowances for Credit Losses on Loans

The Company’s loan portfolio totaled $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and the associated allowance for credit losses on loans (“allowance account”) was $86.9 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements, the allowance for credit losses on loans (ACL) is a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance account represented management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering all relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term adjusted for expected prepayments.

In calculating the allowance for credit losses on loans, the loan portfolio was segmented into pools based upon similar risk characteristics. For each loan pool, management measured expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing either a static pool model or a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The static pool model primarily utilized historical loss rates applied to the estimated remaining life of each pool. For the DCF model, management generates cash flow projections at the instrument level adjusting payment expectations for estimated prepayment speed, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default and loss given default. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers while modeling lifetime probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD). The Company’s analysis also determines how expected PD and LGD will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers. The models were adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the forecasted macroeconomic variables were reverted to their historical mean utilizing a rational, systematic basis. Additional qualitative adjustments are applied for risk factors that are not considered within the modeling process but are relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan pools.

We identified the aggregation of determining adjustments for qualitative factors as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination included the high degree of judgment and subjectivity involved in evaluating management’s estimates, particularly as it related to evaluating management’s assessment of the adjustments to qualitative factors. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s significant estimates and assumptions.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

The primary procedures we performed related to this CAM included:

●

Obtained an understanding of the Company’s process for establishing qualitative factor adjustments in the ACL, including the qualitative factor adjustment model used as the method for developing the qualitative adjustments

●

Evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the key qualitative adjustments to the ACL

●

Evaluated the completeness and accuracy and the relevance of the key data used as inputs in the qualitative factor adjustment process

●

Evaluated the reasonableness of the key assumptions used as inputs in the basis used for qualitative factor adjustments

Management
’
s Report on Consolidated Financial Statements 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and other financial data were prepared by the management of Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. (Bancorp), which has the responsibility for the integrity of the information presented. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and, as such, include amounts that are the best estimates and judgments of management with consideration given to materiality.

Management is further responsible for maintaining a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the books and records reflect the transactions of Bancorp and that its established policies and procedures are carefully followed. Management believes that Bancorp’s system, taken as a whole, provides reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization, and the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

Management also seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of Bancorp’s financial data by the careful selection and training of qualified personnel, an internal audit function and organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility.

Forvis Mazars, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of Bancorp included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report on Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

The Board of Directors provides its oversight role for the consolidated financial statements through the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management, the internal auditors, and the independent auditors, each on a private basis and as a whole, to review matters relating to financial reporting, the internal control systems, and the scope and results of audit efforts. The internal and independent auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee also recommends the appointment of the independent auditors to the Board of Directors, and ultimately has sole authority to appoint or replace the independent auditors.

Management
’
s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The management of Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary (Bancorp) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of Bancorp’s Chairman/CEO and CFO, and effected by Bancorp’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance GAAP. This process includes those policies and procedures that:

●

Pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Bancorp;

●

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Bancorp’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the control criteria established in a report entitled 
Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013)
, issued by the COSO. Based on such assessment, management has concluded that Bancorp’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2024.
