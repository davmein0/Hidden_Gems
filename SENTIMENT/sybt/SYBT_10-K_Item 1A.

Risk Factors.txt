Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

An investment in Bancorp’s common stock is subject to risks inherent in its business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this filing. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to Bancorp or that Bancorp currently deems to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. The value or market price of Bancorp’s common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and an investor could lose all or part of their investment.

There are factors, many beyond Bancorp’s control, which may significantly change the results or expectations of Bancorp. Some of these factors are described below, however, many are described in the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Economic, Market and Credit Risks

Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.

Our primary source of income is from net interest spread, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We expect to periodically experience gaps in interest rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities, meaning that either interest-bearing liabilities may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move in a way that constricts net interest spread and NIM, earnings could be negatively affected.

Many factors affect fluctuation of market interest rates, including, but not limited to the following:

●

the FRB’s actions to change interest rates

●

inflation or deflation

●

recession

●

changes in unemployment

●

changes in the money supply

●

local, regional, national or international disorder and instability in financial markets

Deposit rates tend to be tied to the short end of the rate curve, such as the FFTR, while our fixed-rate loans are largely priced based upon longer term rates, typically five-year offerings. The spreads between these shorter and middle/longer-term portions of the yield curve are critical to our pricing strategies and ultimately net interest income. As a result, a flattened or inverted yield curve, such as that experienced throughout the industry in recent years, may increase our funding costs while limiting rates that can be earned on loans and investments, thereby decreasing our net interest income and earnings. Our asset-liability management strategy, which is designed to mitigate risk from changes in market interest rates, may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

The interest rate environment has experienced significant volatility over the past several years. The FRB’s severe, pandemic-driven interest rate reductions in March of 2020 lowered the FFTR to a range of 0% - 0.25%, and Prime to 3.25%, levels that were sustained for approximately two years. In an effort to combat the resulting inflation that had risen to its highest levels in decades, the FRB increased the FFTR a total of 525 bps via numerous, incremental rate increases over the course of 2022 and 2023, driving the FFTR to a range of 5.25% - 5.50-%, and Prime to 8.50%, by July of 2023.

These levels of interest rates were sustained for over a year until September of 2024, when the FRB reduced the FFTR 50 bps, representing their first rate reduction in over four years, lowering the FFTR to a range of 4.75% - 5.00%, and Prime to 8.00%. Consistent with a strategy of engineering a “soft landing,” they followed suit in November and December of 2024, cutting the FFTR further with respective 25 bps reductions, bringing the FFTR to a range of 4.25% - 4.50%, and Prime to 7.50%, as of December 31, 2024.

The dramatic rise in interest rates experienced in 2022 provided significant benefit to NIM, as interest earning assets experienced higher yields and elevated levels of liquidity allowed deposit costs to remain near pandemic-era lows. However, as liquidity dissipated in 2023, driven in large part by the institutional failures of that year, intense competition for deposits created significant pricing pressure and drove deposit costs up. The resulting shift in Bancorp’s deposit mix, with a large portion of non-interest bearing and lower-rate deposits migrating to higher-yielding alternatives, created significant NIM compression, which was a scenario that continued into 2024 in conjunction with Bancorp’s substantial loan growth. While short term interest rates have recently declined consistent with the FRB’s rate reductions, the middle and longer-term portions of the yield curve have been relatively stagnant. Managing volatility within the interest rate environment will continue to be a primary focus for Bancorp, and the banking industry generally, as we enter 2025.

The current economic outlook remains uncertain and is regularly changing as new economic data becomes available and the FRB’s efforts to manage economic challenges continue. Recent projections indicate that the FRB will slow or halt FFTR rate reductions in 2025. While NIM expansion was experienced in the second half of 2024, the previously mentioned flattening of the yield curve, pricing pressure/competition for both loans and deposits, and changing levels of liquidity could continue to pose challenges to NIM and net interest spread in 2025.

Financial condition and profitability depend significantly on local and national economic conditions.

Our success depends on general economic conditions locally, regionally and nationally. A portion of our customers’ ability to repay their obligations is directly tied to local, regional, national or global economic activity. Deterioration in the quality of the credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and ultimately capital.

While the economic outlook for 2025 is generally positive, proposed policy changes from the incoming administration, including tariffs and extended or additional tax cuts, the FRB’s continued efforts to control inflation and other economic challenges, and compounding geopolitical risks create a number of uncertainties heading into 2025. The impact these changes, and any other developments, have on local, regional and national economic conditions could have a significant effect on our borrowers’ ability to meet contractual obligations.

Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, which could negatively impact earnings. 

The ACL on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments reflect management’s estimate of credit losses expected in the loan portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, as of the balance sheet date. These estimates are the result of our continuing evaluation of specific credit risks and loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, industry concentrations, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, collateral valuations and other factors that may provide an indication of potential credit losses. The determination of our allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires assumptions to be made by management. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect or economic problems are worse than projected, adjustments may be necessary to allow for changing economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Any material increase to the required level of ACL, or insufficiency of the ACL to cover actual loan losses, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Federal and state regulators annually review our allowance and may require an adjustment in the ACL on loans. If regulatory agencies require any increase in the allowance for which we had not allocated, it would have a negative effect on our financial results.

Our credit quality metrics are currently at solid levels and this trend could normalize over time.

Over the past several years, our asset quality metrics have trended within a narrow range, exceeding benchmarks and reaching historically strong levels. We realize that present asset quality metrics are positive and, recognizing the cyclical nature of the lending business, we anticipate this trend will likely normalize over time.

Credit-related concerns stemming from the higher interest rate environment and contractual renewal and maturity activity may be experienced over the next year. Strong loan volumes were experienced during the historically low pandemic-era interest rate environment that began in 2020 and was marked by Prime falling to 3.25%, a level at which it remained until 2022. Given the standard five-year term often associated with many of our traditional lending facilities, 2025 will begin a period of elevated interest rate risk for certain borrowers, as notes originated or renewed during that period will either renew or mature in an interest rate environment that is now significantly higher, with Prime more than doubling since 2020 and standing at 7.50% as of December 31, 2024.

Any inability of our borrowers to meet their contractual obligations, or any worsening of our borrowers financial condition, could result in the erosion of our credit metrics, including higher levels of criticized or non-accrual loans, increased reserves for potential losses within the ACL on loans and increased net charge off activity.

Financial condition and profitability could be negatively impacted by collateral values.

We offer a variety of secured loans, including C&I lines of credit, C&I term loans, real estate, C&D, HELOCs, consumer and other loans. In instances where borrowers are unable to repay their loans and there has been deterioration in the value of loan collateral, we could experience higher loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, and results of operations.

A combination of higher interest rates and rising central business district vacancies across the country have created credit and collateral concerns over the past year, specifically within the CRE sector. While we believe the quality of our CRE portfolio, and the overall loan portfolio, remains solid, with no exposure to large office towers and minimal exposure to central business districts, we are not immune from potential deterioration in the value of loan collateral and could be negatively impacted by the effects of any such activity.

Significant stock market volatility could negatively affect our financial results.

Income from WM&T constitutes approximately 45% of non-interest income. WM&T AUM are expressed in terms of market value, and a significant portion of fee income is based upon those values, which generally fluctuate consistent with overall capital markets. Any decline in the market value of WM&T AUM could have a meaningful impact on non-interest income and negatively affect our financial results.

Capital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time. These conditions may place downward pressure on credit availability, credit worthiness and customers’ inclinations to borrow. Prolonged volatility or a significant disruption could negatively impact customers’ ability to seek new loans or to repay existing loans. Personal wealth of many borrowers and guarantors has historically added a source of financial strength to certain loans and would be negatively impacted by severe market declines. Sustained reliance on personal assets to make loan payments would result in deterioration of their liquidity, and could result in loan defaults.

The value of our investment securities may be negatively affected by factors outside of our control and impairment of these securities could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of our investment securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in market interest rates, rating agency actions, defaults by issuers or with respect to underlying securities, volatility and liquidity within capital markets and changes in local, regional, national or global economic conditions. Impairment to the fair value of these securities can result in realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets or deferred tax assets could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

In accordance with GAAP, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital. At December 31, 2024, Bancorp had goodwill of $194 million.

Bancorp’s intangible assets primarily relate to core deposits and customer relationships. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated life. Intangible assets, premises and equipment and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our intangible assets may be impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital. At December 31, 2024, Bancorp had intangible assets of $16 million.

In assessing the potential for realization of DTAs, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTAs will not be realized. Assessing the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence, both negative and positive, including whether future taxable income in sufficient amounts and character within the carryback and carryforward periods is available under tax law, including the use of tax planning strategies. We have concluded that, based on the level of positive evidence, it is more likely than not that at December 31, 2024 all DTAs will be realized. At December 31, 2024, Bancorp had DTAs totaling $72 million.

The impact of each of these impairment matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. 

Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties and through transactions with counterparties in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional customers. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more bank or non-bank financial services companies, or the bank or non-bank financial services industries in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could result in losses or defaults by us or other institutions. These losses or defaults could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The bank failures of early 2023, which included three of the four largest bank failures in U.S. history, created a liquidity crisis within the banking industry and temporarily raised questions amongst depositors regarding the soundness of the banking system generally. While Bancorp was not explicitly impacted by these failures, remaining well-capitalized and successfully managing the fluctuations in liquidity created by these events, any future bank failures, the failure of financial institutions with whom we have relationships, or related events and/or regulatory action stemming from such activity could adversely affect us.

Our mortgage banking line of business is highly dependent upon programs administered by the FNMA and FHLMC. Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs or servicing eligibility standards could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Our ability to generate revenue through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends to a significant degree on programs administered by the FNMA and FHLMC. These entities play powerful roles in the residential mortgage industry and as a result, we have significant business relationships with them. Our status as an approved seller and servicer with both entities is subject to compliance with their selling and servicing guidelines.

Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction or material change in, the operation of the FNMA and FHLMC, or any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary mortgage market or the underwriting criteria of the FNMA or FHLMC would likely prevent us from originating and selling most, if not all, of our mortgage loan originations. Further, any change to the structure or operation of these agencies stemming from their potential exit from the government conservatorship and recapitalization could significantly impact our mortgage banking line of business.

Derivatives associated with our mortgage banking line of business subject us to interest rate and counter-party risks, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist primarily of mandatory forward sales contracts and interest rate lock loan commitments. Mandatory forward contracts represent future loan commitments to deliver loans at a specified price and date and are used to manage interest rate risk on loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Interest rate lock loan commitments represent commitments to fund loans at a specific rate.

16

Table of Contents

We are exposed to interest rate risk on loans held for sale and rate lock loan commitments. As market interest rates fluctuate, the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and rate lock commitments will decline or increase. To offset this interest rate risk, we enter into derivatives, such as mandatory forward contracts to sell loans. The fair value of these mandatory forward contracts will fluctuate as market interest rates fluctuate, and the change in the value of these instruments is expected to largely, though not entirely, offset the change in fair value of loans held for sale and rate lock commitments. While the objective of this activity is to minimize the exposure to losses on rate lock loan commitments and loans held for sale due to market interest rate fluctuations, the net effect of derivatives on earnings depends on risk management activities and a variety of other factors, including: market interest rate volatility; the amount of rate lock commitments that close; the ability to fill the forward contracts before expiration; and the time period required to close and sell loans. The extent to which these derivatives do not offset each other could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Mandatory forward contracts also contain an element of risk in that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In the event the counterparties fail to deliver commitments or are unable to fulfill their obligations, we could potentially incur significant additional costs by replacing the positions at then-current market rates, adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations.

Changing industry trends or regulations related to consumer deposit relationships could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Competitive and regulatory factors surrounding the developing trend of financial institutions reducing or eliminating certain deposit account fees, particularly overdraft-related fees, presents a significant challenge to maintaining deposit-related non-interest income in the future and potentially threatens a revenue stream that has been in an industry-wide, regulation-driven decline for several years. Strategic decisions surrounding this trend may impact not only deposit-related income, but also deposit relationships in general, particularly for retail customers.

Any elimination of, or reduction or material change to, the fees we charge for certain deposit-related services could result in a significant decline of non-interest income. Failure to closely monitor, and appropriately adapt to, changes in industry practices and consumer behavior could have an adverse impact on our performance.

Strategic Risks

Acquisitions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

An institution that we acquire may have asset quality issues or contingent liabilities that we did not discover or fully recognize in the due diligence process, thereby resulting in unanticipated losses. Acquisitions of other institutions also typically require integration of different corporate cultures, loan and deposit products, pricing strategies, data processing systems and other technologies, accounting, compliance, internal audit and financial reporting systems, operating systems and internal controls, marketing programs and personnel of the acquired institution. The integration process is complicated and time consuming and could divert our attention from other business concerns and may be disruptive to our customers and customers of the acquired institution. Our failure to successfully integrate an acquired institution could result in loss of key customers and employees, and prevent us from achieving expected synergies and cost savings.

Further, exposure to new geographical markets in which Bancorp has limited brand recognition, history or general knowledge of, may also result in a failure to realize the anticipated or expected benefits of an acquisition.

Additionally, we may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds, thereby increasing our leverage and reducing liquidity, or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.

Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect profitability.

We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more so as a result of earnings pressure from peer organizations, legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We face vigorous competition in price and structure of financial products from banks and other financial institutions. In recent years, credit unions have expanded their lending mix and now compete heavily with banks in the CRE lending market. Non-traditional providers’ high risk tolerance for fixed rate, long-term loans could adversely affect our net loan growth and results of operations. We also compete with other non-traditional providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. As internet-based financial services continue to grow in acceptance, we must remain relevant as an institution where consumers and businesses value personal service while other institutions offer these services without human interaction. The variety of sources of competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services, increase operational costs through expanded product offerings, reduce market share and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.

Our performance is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for qualified employees in the industry and markets in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the individuals wanted or needed for certain positions. Changes in the labor market and general employment trends, including elevated employee attrition, labor availability and wage inflation, also present challenges to our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.

If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain the Company’s competitive position, our performance, including the Company’s competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to liquidity risks.

Liquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, FHLB advances and other borrowings, sales of investment securities, sales of loans and other sources could have a significant negative effect on our liquidity.

While our deposit portfolio represents our primary funding source, the availability of secondary funding sources, such as the FHLB, and other contingency funding sources depends on a number of factors, including our ability to pledge collateral that meets or exceeds required standards, the funding facilities our partnering financial institutions are both willing and able to provide, and Bancorp’s financial condition and capital levels. The deterioration of any of these factors, among others, could result in the availability of secondary funding sources being reduced or eliminated altogether.

Prudently managing deposit and borrowing costs to maintain the liquidity necessary to profitably meet loan demand and operational needs is critical to our success. Any failure to manage the challenges associated with changing levels of liquidity could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to maintain and/or raise deposits is critical to our strategic goals. Any failure to successfully manage our deposit portfolio could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Our deposit portfolio is our primary source of funding. As such, capitalizing on strategic opportunities and managing our overall funding costs are directly impacted by our ability to maintain and/or raise deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by several factors, including rates paid by us and/or bank and non-bank competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments, general economic and market conditions and other factors. Successfully maintaining and/or growing our deposit portfolio depends on our ability to manage all related factors, which could necessitate offering interest rates on our deposit products that meet or exceed prevailing market rates and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Table of Contents

We’ve experienced a shift in the mix of our deposit portfolio over the past two years, consistent with a higher interest rate environment. Customers have moved from non-interest or low-interest bearing deposits into higher yielding options, particularly time deposits and money market offerings, which has driven a substantial increase in the cost of deposits and overall funding. Further, alternative investment options for customers holding excess levels of liquidity, such as treasury bonds, have resulted in a portion of deposit balances being invested with non-bank competitors, such as brokerages. While we have generally not experienced fallout within the customer base as a result, such activity impacts our overall deposit levels.

Additionally, as a commercial bank, we are dependent on large commercial deposits. We consider the majority of these deposits to be core funds, as they represent long-standing, full-service relationships and are a testament to our commitment to partner with business customers by providing exemplary service and competitive products. However, a sudden shift in behavior or financial condition amongst our larger deposit customers resulting in balances being reduced or exiting Bancorp altogether could materially impact deposit levels and our overall funding strategy.

Our investment in tax credit partnerships may not generate expected or anticipated returns, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

We periodically invest in tax credit partnerships that generate federal income tax credits. The tax benefit of these investments is expected to exceed the amortization expense associated with them, resulting in a positive impact on net income. Such credits are subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance requirements that must be met at the project level.

Any change or potential enactment of applicable tax code, or the inability of the projects to be completed or properly managed, depend on factors that are out of our control and could impact our ability to realize expected or anticipated returns. Should we not be able to realize the tax credits and other benefits associated with such investments, our results of operation and financial condition could be negatively impacted.

Operational Risks

Our risk management framework could prove ineffective, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We have established a risk management framework to identify, assess and manage our risk exposure. Our enterprise-wide framework is designed to analyze the specific risks we are subject to by evaluating type, likelihood of occurrence and potential severity in an effort to determine levels of inherent risk. We then identify and evaluate the related controls, or lack thereof, around each identified risk to determine the levels of residual risk, subsequently deciding if our controls are sufficient or if any action is warranted.

Any failure or inability of our risk management framework to identify, assess or manage the risks we may be exposed to could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our accounting policies and methods are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.

Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP.

We have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or reducing a liability. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well-controlled and applied consistently.

Policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and estimates pertaining to these matters, there can be no assurances that actual our results will not differ from those estimates. See the section titled “
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
” in “

An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our operations depend upon, among other things, infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, information systems breaches, corporate account take-over, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry, the economy as a whole or on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business continuity plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of operations. Occurrence of any failures or interruptions of information systems could damage our reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Security breaches could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our assets, which are at risk for cyber-attacks, include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. Cyber security risks include cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, theft, and corporate account takeovers. We employ many preventive and detective controls to protect our assets, and provide mandatory recurring information security training for all employees. We have invested in multiple preventative tools in an attempt to protect customers from cyber threats and corporate account takeover and regularly provide educational information regarding cyber threats to customers. We utilize multiple third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. While we require third parties, many of whom are small companies, to have similar or superior controls in place, a breach of information could still occur. See the section titled “
Cybersecurity
” for more information related to our cybersecurity risk management practices.

Incidences of fraud could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Fraud is a major, and increasing, operational risk for us and the banking industry generally. The sophistication and methods used to perpetuate fraud continue to evolve as technology changes. Activities of the Bank that subject Bancorp to risk of fraud by customers, employees, vendors, or members of the general public include ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM/ITM transactions, checking transactions, card transactions and loan originations. While we continually evaluate and update our anti-fraud measures, some level of fraud loss is unavoidable and the risk of loss cannot be eliminated. Repeated incidences of fraud or a single large occurrence could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

We are dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of the Company
’
s records and data. 

We rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. While we perform a review of controls instituted by applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform testing of user controls, we rely on continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over security of client data. We may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur reputational damage, if a third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, if these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or should terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them on a timely basis, our business operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, or if we incurred excessive costs involved with replacing third-party service provider, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our ability to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands is constantly being challenged.

The financial services industry is constantly undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Future success of Bancorp will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by utilizing technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional operational efficiencies and greater privacy and security protection for customers and their personal information. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. We rely on third party providers for many of our technology-driven banking products and services. Some of these companies may be slow to respond with upgrades or enhancements to their products to keep pace with improvements in technology or the introduction of competing products. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could impair our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Changes in customer use of banks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The rapid evolution of non-bank alternatives for initiation and completion of financial transactions puts us at risk of losing sources of revenue and funding. The ability of customers to pay bills, deposit and transfer funds, and purchase assets without utilizing the banking system could result in loss of fee income, deposits, and loans. If we are unable to continue timely development of competitive new products and services, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Regulatory and Legal Risks

We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes to or lack of compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations.

We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change to, or addition of, applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on the ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including branching and acquisitions.

We will be subject to increased regulation once our total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion.

As of December 31, 2024, Bancorp had total consolidated assets of $8.86 billion. However, should our total consolidated assets exceed $10 billion, we will become subject to increased regulatory requirements. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) supervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws; (ii) enhanced methodologies for the determination of FDIC insurance assessments, which could result in higher assessment rates; (iii) limitations on interchange transaction fees for debit card transactions, which would reduce our interchange revenue; and (iv) adherence to enhanced regulatory and risk management frameworks.

Bancorp has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs associated with preparing for the heightened regulatory requirements of this threshold. Developing processes and procedures, designing and implementing additional internal controls, maintaining and adopting necessary technological capabilities and monitoring compliance with these requirements may result in additional personnel expense and the incurrence of other material costs, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Changes in tax laws and regulations may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Any change or potential enactment of tax legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax law, including provisions impacting tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expense, credits and exemptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are set to expire December 31, 2025. While the recent elections have generally been perceived as a positive for tax policy, any political gridlock regarding the structure of tax policy, the expiration, renewal or reformation of current tax provisions, or the proposal of additional changes to the tax code could present challenges or necessitate strategic changes for our business. Further, such changes, or delays in making crucial tax policy decisions, could have adverse repercussions for both our business and that of our customers.

Transactions between Bancorp and its former insurance subsidiary, the Captive, may be subject to certain IRS responsibilities and penalties.

The Captive, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Bancorp, was a Nevada-based captive insurance company that was taxed under Section 831(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. On April 10, 2023, the IRS issued a proposed regulation that would potentially classify section 831(b) captive activity as a, “listed transaction,” and possibly disallow the related tax benefits, both prospectively and retroactively. The regulation was finalized in January 2025 and its impact is being evaluated by management. Bancorp elected not to renew the Captive in August of 2023 and ultimately dissolved the Captive in December of 2023. The finalization of the proposal and any disallowance of related tax benefits could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to litigation risk and reputational risk pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.

From time to time, customers may make claims and take legal action pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from regulators, investors and other stakeholders with respect to our ESG practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 

Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from regulators, investors and other stakeholders related to their ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure. Additionally, concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts to mitigate those impacts. Failure to adapt or comply with related legislation, regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

Risk Management and Strategy

Bancorp has established an 
Information Security program
, which is overseen by the Director of Information Security and the Information Security Officer. This role reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Information Security program is structured upon and informed by the Center for Internet Security, which aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. The primary objectives of the Information Security program are to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information assets, comply with applicable laws, regulations, contractual obligations and manage significant risks arising from cybersecurity threats. These processes are integrated into the institution’s overall risk management system, ensuring a unified approach to risk mitigation.

The Information Security program includes several key processes and functions such as access control monitoring, threat detection, vulnerability management, understanding the implications of technological changes, managing third-party relationships, and mandating employee awareness and education among other components. These activities aim to prevent avoidable errors, raise awareness, identify potential vulnerabilities, protect systems, detect security incidents and recover from any incidents that occur. These processes are continually updated and enhanced to keep pace with the evolving cybersecurity landscape.

To ensure effective risk management, Bancorp adopts the three lines of defense model, which consists of the following elements:

●

The first line of defense is operational management, which is responsible for implementing and maintaining the Information Security program, as well as identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks on a day-to-day basis.

●

The second line of defense consists of the risk management and compliance functions, which provide oversight, guidance, and support to the first line of defense, as well as monitoring and reporting on the institution’s cybersecurity posture and performance.

●

The third line of defense is the internal audit function, which provides independent assurance of the effectiveness and adequacy of the Information Security program, as well as compliance with relevant policies, standards and regulations.

When necessary, the institution 
engages
 external assessors, consultants, and auditors with expertise in cybersecurity to evaluate and enhance its systems, policies and procedures. These external parties provide valuable insights into emerging threats and best practices, enhancing Bancorp’s ability to adapt and respond effectively. Bancorp also undergoes reoccurring regulatory examinations, and identified issues are actively tracked and monitored for remediation.

In addition to external entities, Bancorp has internal oversight mechanisms to identify cybersecurity risks, including those associated with its 
use
 of third-party service providers and related downstream service providers. This includes thorough due diligence during vendor selection, ongoing monitoring, setting clear contractual obligations to uphold cybersecurity standards and other interventions necessary to address risk such as those addressed in Part I Item 1A “
Risk Factors.
”

In the event of a security incident, Bancorp has developed an Incident Response Plan to guide necessary actions. The Incident Response Plan is a well-established document that is updated at least annually. It provides guidance before, during and after a confirmed or suspected security incident, outlining how to minimize the duration and damage of an incident, identifying a response team and streamlining actions to improve recovery time.

While Bancorp has not experienced any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected its operations, it acknowledges the potential impact such risks could have on business strategy, financial condition and operational resilience. The institution remains vigilant, continuously evaluating and enhancing its cybersecurity measures to preemptively address any potential risks that could impact its operations or financial condition.
 This approach aligns with the institution’s commitment to maintaining the trust and security of its stakeholders in an increasingly digital world.

Governance

Bancorp’s Credit and Risk Committee, which includes board of director representation, maintains a robust oversight framework for evaluating and managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The committee convened four times during the year ended December 31, 2024 in order carry out its oversight responsibilities, engaging directly in discussions about cybersecurity risks to ensure they are comprehensively addressed within the institution’s risk management framework. This included, but was not limited to, vulnerability trends, identified or potential third-party risks, risks precipitated by technological changes, confirmed or potential security incidents, policy and procedure changes, the organization’s risk appetite, the FFIEC’s Cybersecurity Assessment Tool, conclusions from the risk assessment, audit and regulatory reports, routine quarterly and annual reporting, as well as other notable key risk indicators.

The entire board of directors of Bancorp is actively involved in the oversight of the institution’s cybersecurity risks. The Chair of the Credit and Risk Committee regularly reports the committee’s activities to the board of directors. In addition, management reports to the board of directors on an as-needed basis concerning high-priority information security-related topics, such as cybersecurity incidents. This ensures that the board of directors is always informed and can provide strategic direction on significant cybersecurity matters.

A dedicated committee, the 
Information Security Risk Committee
, is specifically responsible for overseeing cybersecurity threats and informing the decisions of the Credit and Risk Committee. The Information Security Risk Committee, comprising individuals with diverse expertise in technology, risk management and cybersecurity, meets monthly. They discuss a range of strategic topics, including vulnerability trends, identified or potential third-party risks, risks precipitated by technological changes, confirmed or potential security incidents and other items related to the institution’s preparedness measures. The Information Security Risk Committee’s purpose is to provide strategic direction for the Information Security program and to evaluate known risks based on Bancorp’s existing controls and risk appetite.

Management also plays a crucial role in assessing and managing Bancorp’s cybersecurity risks. Specific roles, such as the 
Information Security Officer and Director of Information Security
, are tasked with monitoring, evaluating, and mitigating these risks in coordination with the Information Security Risk Committee. Both the Information Security Officer and Director of Information Security possess relevant expertise and experience in cybersecurity, enabling them to effectively navigate and respond to emerging threats. The Information Security Officer, who holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Master’s degree in Information Systems Security, along with several relevant industry certifications, has been with Bancorp for four years and has additional experience working in technology outside of the organization. The Director of Information Security, who also holds several relevant certifications, has been with Bancorp’s Information Security department for 20 years and brings extensive experience with technology.

To keep the Information Security Risk Committee and Credit and Risk Committee informed, management ensures consistent and structured reporting mechanisms are in place. They regularly update these governing bodies on the prevention, detection and mitigation of cybersecurity incidents. This reporting includes detailed insights into the institution’s cybersecurity posture, ongoing initiatives and any necessary adjustments or enhancements to existing measures.

The communication between management, the Information Security Risk Committee, and the Credit and Risk Committee facilitates a holistic understanding of cybersecurity risks, ensuring proactive measures are in place to safeguard Bancorp's operations, preserve its financial stability, and maintain the trust of its stakeholders.
