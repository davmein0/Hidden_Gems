MARKET

FOR

REGISTRANT’S

COMMON

EQUITY,

RELATED

STOCKHOLDER

MATTERS

AND

ISSUER 
PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
Common Stock 
Popular’s Common Stock is traded on

the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “BPOP”.

During 2024, the Corporation declared cash dividends in the

total amount of $2.56 per common share outstanding,

for an 
aggregate amount of $183.9 million. The Common Stock ranks junior to all series of

Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights 
on liquidation,

dissolution or

winding up

of Popular.

Our ability

to declare

or pay

dividends on,

or purchase,

redeem or

otherwise 
acquire, the Common

Stock is subject

to certain restrictions

in the event

that Popular fails

to pay or

set aside full

dividends on the 
Preferred Stock for the latest dividend period. 
During the year ended

December 31, 2024, the Corporation

repurchased 2,256,420 shares of common stock

for $217.3 
million, at

an average

price of

$96.32 per

share. These

actions resulted

from a

common stock

repurchase authorization

of up

to 
$500 million announced on July

24, 2024. The Corporation’s planned common

stock repurchases may be executed in

open market 
transactions,

privately

negotiated

transactions,

block

trades

or

any

other

manner

determined

by

the

Corporation.

The

timing, 
quantity

and

price

of

such

repurchases

will

be

subject

to

various

factors,

including

market

conditions,

the

Corporation’s

capital 
position

and financial

performance, the

capital impact

of strategic

initiatives and

regulatory and

tax considerations.

The common 
stock repurchase

program does

not require

the Corporation

to acquire

a specific

dollar amount

or number

of shares

and may

be 
modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior

notice. 
On July 12, 2022, the Corporation completed an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program for the repurchase of an 
aggregate $400

million of

Popular’s common stock

for which

an initial

delivery of

3,483,942 shares

were delivered

in March

2022 
(the

“March

ASR

Agreement”).

Upon

the

final

settlement

of

the

March

ASR

Agreement,

the

Corporation

received

an

additional 
1,582,922

shares

of

common

stock.

The

Corporation

repurchased a

total

of

5,066,864 shares

at

an

average

purchase

price

of 
$78.94, which were recorded as treasury stock by

$440 million under the March ASR Agreement. 
On December

7, 2022

the Corporation

completed the

settlement of

another ASR

Agreement for

the repurchase

of an 
aggregate $231

million of

Popular’s common stock,

for which

an initial

2,339,241 shares

were delivered

on August

26, 2022

(the 
“August ASR Agreement”). Upon the final settlement of the ASR Agreement, the Corporation received an additional 840,024 shares 
of common

stock. The

Corporation repurchased

a total

of 3,179,265

shares at

an average

purchase price

of $72.66,

which were 
recorded as treasury stock by $245 million under

the August ASR Agreement. 
Additional information concerning legal or

regulatory restrictions on the payment

of dividends by Popular,

BPPR and PB 
is contained under the caption “Regulation and Supervision”

in Item 1 herein. 
As

of

February

27,

2025,

Popular

had

6,100

stockholders

of

record

of

the

Common

Stock,

not

including

beneficial 
owners whose shares

are held in

record names

of brokers

or other

nominees. The last

sales price

for the

Common Stock

on that 
date was $100.41 per share. 

42 
Preferred Stock 
Popular has 30,000,000 shares of

authorized Preferred Stock that may

be issued in one

or more series, and the

shares 
of each series

shall have such

rights and preferences as

shall be fixed

by the Board

of Directors when authorizing

the issuance of 
that particular series. Popular’s Preferred Stock

issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024

consisted of: 
●

885,726 shares of 6.375% non-cumulative monthly income Preferred Stock, Series A, no par value, liquidation preference 
value of $25 per share. 
All series of

Preferred Stock are pari

passu. Dividends on each

series of Preferred Stock

are payable if declared

by our 
Board

of

Directors.

Our

ability

to

declare

and

pay

dividends

on

the

Preferred

Stock

is

dependent

on

certain

Federal

regulatory 
considerations,

including

the

guidelines

of

the

Federal

Reserve

Board

regarding

capital

adequacy

and

dividends.

The

Board

of 
Directors is not obligated to declare dividends and

dividends do not accumulate in the event

they are not paid. 
Monthly

dividends

on

the

Preferred

Stock

amounted

to

a

total

of

$1.4

million

for

the

year

2024.

There

can

be

no 
assurance that any dividends will be declared on

the Preferred Stock in any future periods. 
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
Popular

offers

a

dividend reinvestment

and stock

purchase plan

(the “Plan”)

for

our shareholders

that

allows them

to 
reinvest their dividends in shares of the Common Stock at a

5% discount from the average market price at the time of the

issuance. 
Under the

Plan, shareholders

may

also purchase

shares of

Common Stock

at

prevailing market

prices by

making

optional cash 
payments. 
Equity Based Plans 
On May

12, 2020, the

stockholders of

the Corporation

approved the Popular,

Inc. 2020

Omnibus Incentive Plan,

which 
permits the

Corporation to issue

several types of

stock-based compensation to

employees and directors

of the Corporation

and/or 
any of its subsidiaries (the “2020 Incentive Plan”). The 2020 Incentive Plan replaced the Popular, Inc. 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan, 
which was in

effect prior to

the adoption of the

2020 Incentive Plan.

As of December 31,

2024, the maximum number of

shares of 
common stock remaining available for future issuance under this plan was 2,896,568. For information about

the securities remaining 
available for issuance under our equity-based plans,

refer to Part III, Item 12.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This

Form

10-K contains

“forward-looking statements”

within the

meaning

of

the

U.S. Private

Securities Litigation

Reform Act

of 
1995,

including,

without

limitation,

statements

about

Popular,

Inc.’s

(the

“Corporation,”

“Popular,”

“we,”

“us,”

“our”)

business, 
financial condition, results

of operations, plans,

objectives and future

performance. These statements

are not

guarantees of future 
performance,

are

based

on

management’s

current

expectations

and,

by

their

nature,

involve

risks,

uncertainties,

estimates

and 
assumptions. Potential

factors, some

of which

are beyond

the Corporation’s

control, could

cause actual

results to

differ materially 
from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect 
of competitive and

economic factors, and our

reaction to those factors,

the adequacy of

the allowance for loan

losses, delinquency 
trends, market

risk and

the impact

of interest

rate changes

(including on

our cost

of deposits),

capital markets

conditions, capital 
adequacy

and

liquidity,

and

the

effect

of

legal

and

regulatory

proceedings

and

new

accounting

standards

on

the

Corporation’s 
financial condition

and results

of operations.

All statements

contained herein

that

are not

clearly

historical in

nature are

forward-
looking, and the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continues,”

“expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “project” and similar expressions

and future 
or conditional verbs

such as

“will,” “would,” “should,”

“could,” “might,” “can,”

“may” or similar

expressions are

generally intended to 
identify forward-looking statements. 
Various factors, some of which

are beyond Popular’s control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, 
or implied by,

such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a

difference include, but are not limited to

the rate of 
growth or

decline in the

economy and employment

levels, as well

as general

business and economic

conditions in the

geographic 
areas we serve and,

in particular, in

the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico

(the “Commonwealth” or “Puerto Rico”), where

a significant 
portion of our business is concentrated; adverse economic conditions, including high levels of inflation, that adversely affect housing 
prices, the

job market,

consumer confidence

and spending

habits which

may affect

in turn,

among other

things, our

level of

non-
performing assets,

charge-offs

and

provision expense;

changes in

interest

rates

and

market liquidity,

which may

reduce interest 
margins,

impact

funding

sources,

reduce

loan

originations,

affect

our

ability

to

originate

and

distribute

financial

products

in

the 
primary and secondary markets and impact the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to return capital to our shareholders; 
the impact of bank failures or adverse

developments at other banks and related negative media coverage of

the banking industry in 
general

on

investor

and

depositor

sentiment

regarding

the

stability

and

liquidity

of

banks;

the

impact

of

the

current

fiscal

and 
economic challenges

of Puerto

Rico and

the measures

taken and

to be

taken by

the Puerto

Rico Government and

the Federally-
appointed oversight board on the economy,

our customers and our business; the amount of Puerto

Rico public sector deposits held 
at the Corporation, whose future balances are uncertain

and difficult to predict and may

be impacted by factors such as the

amount 
of

Federal funds

received by

the P.R.

Government and

the rate

of expenditure

of such

funds, as

well as

the financial

condition, 
liquidity

and

cash

management

practices

of

the

Puerto

Rico

Government

and

its

instrumentalities;

unforeseen

or

catastrophic 
events, including extreme

weather events such

as hurricanes and

other natural disasters,

man-made disasters, acts

of violence or 
war or

pandemics, epidemics

and other

health-related crises,

or the

fear of

any such

event occurring,

any of

which could

cause 
adverse

consequences

for

our

business,

including,

but

not

limited

to,

disruptions

in

our

operations;

our

ability

to

achieve

the 
expected benefits

from

our transformation

initiative, including

our ability

to achieve

projected earnings,

efficiencies and

return on 
tangible common equity and

accurately anticipate costs and expenses

associated therewith; the fiscal and

monetary policies of the 
federal

government

and

its

agencies;

changes

in

federal

bank

regulatory

and

supervisory

policies,

including

required

levels

of 
capital, liquidity, resolution-related requirements and the impact of other proposed capital standards on our capital ratios; changes in 
and

uncertainty

regarding

federal

funding,

tax

and

trade

policies,

and

rulemaking,

supervision,

examination

and

enforcement 
priorities

of

the

current

federal

administration;

increases

to

or

additional

Federal

Deposit

Insurance

Corporation

(“FDIC”) 
assessments, such as the special assessment implemented by the FDIC

to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund

(“DIF”) 
resulting

from

the

receiverships

of

Silicon

Valley

Bank

and

Signature

Bank;

regulatory

approvals

that

may

be

necessary

to 
undertake

certain

actions

or

consummate

strategic

transactions,

such

as

acquisitions

and

dispositions;

the

relative

strength

or 
weakness of

the consumer

and commercial

credit sectors

and of

the real

estate markets

in Puerto

Rico and

the other

markets in 
which our borrowers are located; a deterioration in the credit

quality of our clients, customers and counterparties; the performance

of 
the stock and bond markets; competition in the financial services industry; possible legislative, tax or regulatory changes; a failure in 
or breach of our

operational or security systems or

infrastructure or those of Evertec,

Inc., our provider of core

financial transaction 
processing and information technology services, or

of third parties providing services to

us, including as a

result of cyberattacks, e-
fraud, denial-of-services and computer intrusion, that might result

in, among other things, loss or breach of customer data, disruption 
of services, reputational damage or additional costs to Popular; changes in market rates and prices which may adversely impact the 
value of financial assets and liabilities; potential judgments, claims, damages, penalties, fines, enforcement actions and reputational 
damage resulting

from

pending or

future litigation

and regulatory

or government

investigations or

actions; changes

in accounting 
standards,

rules

and

interpretations;

our

ability

to

grow

our

core

businesses;

decisions

to

downsize,

sell

or

close

branches

or 
business units or otherwise change our business

mix; and management’s ability to identify and manage

these and other risks.

legal and

regulatory proceedings, as

discussed in
