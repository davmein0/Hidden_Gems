OVERVIEW 
The Corporation is a

diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company subject to the

supervision and regulation of the Board

of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation has operations in Puerto Rico, the United States (“U.S.”) mainland, and 
the

U.S.

and

British

Virgin

Islands.

In

Puerto

Rico,

the

Corporation provides

retail,

mortgage,

and

commercial

banking services 
through its

principal banking

subsidiary,

Banco

Popular

de

Puerto Rico

(“BPPR”), as

well as

broker-dealer,

auto

and

equipment 
leasing and financing, and insurance services through

specialized subsidiaries. In the U.S. mainland, the Corporation

provides retail, 
mortgage, and commercial

banking services,

as well

as equipment leasing

and financing, through

its New York

-chartered banking 
subsidiary, Popular Bank (“PB” or “Popular U.S.”), which has branches located in New York,

New Jersey and Florida. Note 36 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements presents information

about the Corporation’s business segments. 
The shares of the Corporation’s common stock are traded

on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the

symbol BPOP. 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
YEAR 2024 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 
Capital Actions
During the year

ended December 31,

2024, the Corporation

repurchased 2,256,420 shares

of common stock

for $217.3 million,

at 
an average

price of

$96.32 per

share,

under a

common

stock repurchase

authorization of

up to

$500 million.

The

Corporation’s 
planned common stock

repurchases may

be executed in

open market transactions,

privately negotiated transactions,

block trades 
or any

other manner

determined by

the Corporation.

The timing,

quantity and price

of such

repurchases will

be subject

to various 
factors,

including

market

conditions,

the

Corporation’s

capital

position

and

financial

performance,

the

capital

impact

of

strategic 
initiatives

and

regulatory

and

tax

considerations.

The

common

stock

repurchase

program

does

not

require

the

Corporation

to 
acquire

a

specific

dollar

amount or

number

of

shares

and

may

be

modified,

suspended

or

terminated

at

any

time

without

prior 
notice. 
The

Corporation

increased

its

quarterly

common

stock

dividend

from

$0.62

to

$0.70

per

share,

commencing

with

the

dividend 
declared in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
Tax impact on Intercompany Distributions

During the first quarter of 2024,

the Corporation recognized

$22.9 million of expenses, of which $16.5 million

is reflected in income 
tax expense

and $6.4

million is

reflected in

other operating

expenses, related

to an

out-of-period adjustment

associated with

the 
Corporation’s

U.S.

subsidiary’s

non-payment

of

taxes

on

certain

intercompany

distributions

to

Popular,

Inc.,

the

bank

holding 
company (the “Bank Holding Company” or “BHC”)

in Puerto Rico, a foreign corporation for U.S.

tax purposes.

The adjustment

corrected errors

for income

tax expense

that should

have been

recognized of

$5.5 million

and $5.4

million in

the 
years 2023 and 2022, respectively, and an aggregate of $5.6 million, in the years prior to 2022. The $6.4

million recognized as other 
operating expense corresponded to

interest due up

to March 31,

2024 on the

related late payment

of the withholding

tax, of which 
approximately $3.0 million corresponded to

years prior to

2022. As a result

of this adjustment, the

deferred tax asset related

to the 
net operating loss (“NOL”) of the

BHC and its related valuation allowance was

reduced by $52.2 million. The Corporation evaluated 

55 
the impact of the out-of-period adjustment and concluded it was not material to any previously issued interim or annual consolidated 
financial statements and not material to the year ended

December 31, 2024.

Dividends from

the U.S.

subsidiaries to

the BHC

are subject

to a

Federal 10%

withholding tax

and ordinary

income tax

in Puerto 
Rico, subject

to

foreign tax

credits,

use of

available net

operating losses

and certain

other limitations.

The Corporation

does

not 
anticipate the tax treatment of U.S. sourced dividends

to the BHC to impact BHC liquidity or future

capital actions.

Financial highlights for the year ended December 31,

2024 
The discussion

that follows

provides highlights

of the

Corporation’s results

of

operations for

the year

ended December

31, 2024 
compared to the results of

operations of 2023. It also

provides some highlights with respect to

the Corporation’s financial condition, 
credit quality, capital and liquidity.

The Corporation’s

net income

for the

year ended

December 31,

2024 amounted

to

$614.2 million,

higher by

$72.9 million

when 
compared to a

net income of

$541.3 million for

2023. Higher net

income was mainly

driven by higher

net interest income,

offset in 
part by a higher provision for

credit losses. Excluding expenses incurred in connection with

the FDIC Special Assessment and prior 
period

tax

withholdings,

the

adjusted

net

income

for

2024

was

$646.1

million,

compared

to

$586.6

million

in

2023,

which

also 
excluded

FDIC

Special

Assessment

expenses.

For

more

information on

Non-GAAP

financial

measures

refer

to

the

“Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures” section below. Financial highlights for 2024 include:

●

Net interest income of

$2.3 billion, or $150.8 million

higher than in in 2023,

driven by the reinvestment of

U.S. Treasuries 
and loan

growth across

all portfolios,

partially offset

by higher

cost of

deposits driven

by P.R.

government deposits

and 
online

deposits. Net

interest margin

expanded by

11

bps to

3.24%. On

a taxable

equivalent basis,

net interest

margin 
expanded by 18 bps to 3.49% in 2024, compared

to 3.31% in 2023.

●

The provision for

credit losses of

$256.9 million for

the year ended

December 31,

2024 was $48.3

million higher than

in 
2023, driven by higher reserves due to changes in credit quality in the consumer loan, auto loan and leasing portfolios, as 
well as higher loan volumes,

primarily commercial loans.

●

Non-interest income

amounted to

$658.9 million,

an increase

of

$8.2 million

when compared

with 2023,

mostly due

to 
higher

other

service

fees

during the

year,

mainly

related

to

debit card

fees

and

sale

and

administration of

investment 
products.

●

Operating expenses amounted to

$1.9 billion for

the year 2024,

reflecting a decrease

of $10.5 million when

compared to 
the

same

period

in

2023.

This

decrease

was

mainly

driven

by

expenses

incurred in

2023

including

the

FDIC

Special 
Assessment

expense of

$71.4 million

and

a

goodwill impairment

charge of

$23.0 million

in

our

U.S. based

equipment 
leasing subsidiary. Excluding the impact of these items and the tax impact of intercompany distributions recognized

during 
2024, operating

expenses in

2024 increased

by $63.3

million driven

by higher

personnel costs due

to higher

headcount 
and salary adjustments, and higher technology and

software expenses. 
●

Income tax expense amounted to $182.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, with an effective tax

rate (“ETR”) 
of 22.9%, compared to an income tax expense of $134.2 million for the

previous year, with an ETR of 19.9%.

The income 
tax expense in 2024 included the impact of an out

of period expense of $16.5 million related to intercompany distributions 
between the Bank Holding Company and one of

its U.S. subsidiaries. 
●

At December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s total assets were $73.0 billion, compared to $70.8 billion at December 31, 2023. 
The

increase

of

$2.2

billion

is

primarily

due

to

an

increase

in

loans

held-in-portfolio,

mainly

in

the

commercial, 
construction, and mortgage portfolios.

●

Deposits amounted to $64.9 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $63.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase 
in

deposits was

mainly due

to

higher P.R.

Government deposits

at

BPPR and

time

deposits at

PB.

The

Corporation’s 
borrowings amounted to $1.2 billion at December 31,

2024, compared to $1.1 billion at December

31, 2023.

●

Stockholders’ equity amounted to $5.6 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2023.

The 
Corporation

and

its

banking

subsidiaries

continue

to

be

well-capitalized.

As

of

December

31,

2024,

the

Corporation’s 
tangible book value per common

share was $68.16, an

increase of $8.42 from December

31, 2023. The Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital ratio at December 31, 2024 was 16.03%, compared

to 16.30% at December 31, 2023. 
Transformation Initiatives 
During 2024

the Corporation

made meaningful

progress in

the transformation

of our

customer channels

and enhancement

of our 
customers' experience. The

Corporation believes these

investments will result in

an enhanced digital experience

for our clients,

as 

56 
well as

better technology

and more

efficient processes

for our

employees, and

make us

a more

efficient and

profitable company. 
The Corporation had anticipated to reach a target of 14%

return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) by the fourth quarter of 2025. 
However, due to

a variety of drivers,

including the impact of

the shift to higher-cost

deposits in 2024, and

lower than expected loan 
growth

in

the

U.S.,

the

Corporation

now

expects

to

achieve

at

least

a

12%

ROTCE

by

the

end

of

2025.

Our

technology

and 
business transformation will continue to be a

significant priority for the Corporation.

discussion of

our 2023

results of

2022, see

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This Form

10-K contains financial

information prepared under

accounting principles generally

accepted in the

United States (“U.S. 
GAAP”) and

non-GAAP financial

measures. Management

uses non-GAAP

financial measures

when it

has determined

that these 
measures provide

meaningful information

about the

underlying performance

of the

Corporation’s ongoing

operations. Non-GAAP 
financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by

other 
companies. 
Adjusted net income - Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
In

addition to

analyzing the

Corporation’s results

on

a reported

basis, management

monitors whether

the

impact of

certain non-
recurring

or

infrequent

transactions

need

to

be

excluded

from

the

results

of

operations

to

present

what

is

then

considered

the 
“adjusted

net

income”

of

the

Corporation.

Management believes

that

the

“adjusted

net

income”

provides

meaningful

information 
about

the

underlying

performance of

the

Corporation’s

ongoing

operations.

The

“adjusted

net

income”

is

a

non-GAAP

financial 
measure. 
The following table presents the adjusted net income

for the year ended of December 31, 2024 and

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis

Net

interest

income,

on

a

taxable

equivalent

basis,

is

presented

with

its

different

components

in

Table

5

for

the

year

ended 
December 31,

2024

as compared

with

the same

period in

2023, segregated

by

major categories

of

interest

earning assets

and 
interest-bearing liabilities.

The interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The 
main

sources

of

tax-exempt

interest

income

are

certain

investments

in

obligations

of

the

U.S.

Government,

its

agencies

and 
sponsored

entities,

and

certain

obligations

of

the

Commonwealth

of

Puerto

Rico

and

its

agencies

and

assets

held

by

the 
Corporation’s international

banking entities.

To

facilitate the

comparison of

all interest

related to

these assets,

the interest

income 
has been

converted to

a taxable equivalent

basis, using the

applicable statutory income

tax rates

for each

period. In addition,

this 
measure is also impacted by a portion of interest expense that the Puerto Rico tax law requires to be disallowed, based on an equal 
proportion of

tax-exempt assets

to total

assets, and

by an

allocation of

general and

administrative expenses

attributed to

exempt 
income, reducing the benefit of the tax-exempt income. The effective yield, on a taxable equivalent basis, will vary depending on the 
level of these

expenses that are

attributed to the

available exempt income.

Under Puerto Rico

tax law,

the exempt interest

can be 
deducted up to the

amount of taxable income. Management believes

that this presentation provides meaningful

information since it 
facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from

taxable and exempt sources. 
Net interest

income, on

a taxable

equivalent basis,

as used

by the

Corporation may

not be

comparable to

similarly named

non-
GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
Tangible Common Equity and Tangible Assets 
Tangible

common equity,

tangible common equity ratio, tangible

assets and tangible book value

per common share are

non-GAAP 
financial measures.

Tangible

common equity

ratio and

tangible book

value per

common share

should be

used in

conjunction with 
more

traditional

bank

capital

ratios

commonly

used

by

banks

and

analysts

to

compare

the

capital

adequacy

of

banking 
organizations

with

significant

amounts

of

goodwill

or

other

intangible

assets,

typically

stemming

from

the

use

of

the

purchase 
accounting method for

mergers and acquisitions.

Tangible

common equity,

tangible assets

and other related

measures should not 
be

used

in

isolation

or

as

a substitute

for

stockholders' equity,

total

assets

or

any

other

measure calculated

in

accordance

with 
GAAP.

Moreover,

the manner

in which

the

Corporation calculates

its

tangible common

equity,

tangible assets

and

other

related 
measures may differ from that of other companies

reporting measures with similar names. 
Table

12 provides

a reconciliation of

total stockholders’ equity

to tangible common

equity and total

assets to tangible

assets as

of 
December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES 

60 
The accounting and

reporting policies followed by

the Corporation and its

subsidiaries conform with generally

accepted accounting 
principles in

the United

States of America

(“GAAP”) and

general practices within

the financial services

industry. The

Corporation’s 
significant

accounting

policies,

including

those

related

to

critical

accounting

estimates,

are

described

in

detail

in

Note

2

to

the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read

in conjunction with this section.

Critical accounting

policies that

require management

to make

estimates and

assumptions may

involve significant

judgment about 
the effect

of matters

that are

inherently uncertain

and that

involve a

high degree

of subjectivity.

These estimates

are made

under 
facts and

circumstances at

a point

in time

and changes

in those

facts and

circumstances could

produce actual

results that

differ 
from

those

estimates.

The

following

MD&A

section

is

a

summary

of

what

management

considers

the

Corporation’s

critical 
accounting estimates. 
Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments 
The Corporation

currently measures

at fair

value on

a recurring

basis its

trading debt

securities, debt

securities available-for-sale, 
certain equity securities, derivatives and

mortgage servicing rights. Occasionally,

the Corporation is required to

record other assets 
at fair

value on

a nonrecurring

basis, such

as loans

held-for-sale, loans

held-in-portfolio that

are collateral

dependent and

certain 
other assets. These nonrecurring fair value

adjustments typically result from the application of lower of

cost or fair value accounting 
or write-downs of individual assets.

The

Corporation categorizes

its

assets and

liabilities measured

at fair

value under

the three-level

hierarchy.

The level

within the 
hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to

the valuation methodology used for fair value measurement

are observable. 
The

Corporation

requires

the

use

of

observable

inputs

when

available,

in

order

to

minimize

the

use

of

unobservable

inputs

to 
determine fair value. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are

not necessarily an indication of the risk associated 
with investing

in those

securities. The

amount of

judgment involved

in estimating

the fair

value of

a financial

instrument depends 
upon the availability of

quoted market prices or observable market

parameters. In addition, it may

be affected by other

factors such 
as the

type of instrument,

the liquidity of

the market for

the instrument, transparency

around the inputs

to the valuation,

as well

as 
the contractual characteristics of the instrument.

Broker quotes reflect

market illiquidity as

they are exit

prices. As of

December 31, 2024,

$7 million in

financial assets were

valued 
using broker

quotes: $1 million

in Level 3

assets (mainly tax-exempt

GNMA mortgage-backed securities)

and $6 million

in Level

2 
assets. Level 3 asset values were based on an

internal matrix using local broker quotes from

limited trading activity. 
Trading Debt Securities and Debt Securities Available-for-Sale 
The

majority

of

the

values

for

trading

debt

securities

and

debt

securities

available-for-sale

are

obtained

from

third-party

pricing 
services and

are validated

with alternate

pricing sources

when available.

Securities not

priced by

a secondary

pricing source

are 
documented

and

validated

internally

according

to

their

significance

to

the

Corporation’s

financial

statements.

Management

has 
established materiality thresholds according to the investment class to monitor and investigate material deviations in prices obtained 
from the primary pricing service provider and the secondary pricing source used as support for the valuation results. During the year 
ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation did

not adjust any prices obtained from pricing

service providers or broker dealers. 
Inputs are evaluated to

ascertain that they consider current

market conditions, including the

relative liquidity of the

market. When a 
market quote

for a

specific security

is not

available, the

pricing service

provider generally

uses observable

data to

derive an

exit 
price

for

the

instrument,

such

as

benchmark

yield

curves

and

trade

data

for

similar

products.

To

the

extent

trading

data

is

not 
available, the

pricing service provider

relies on specific

information including dialogue

with brokers,

buy side clients,

credit ratings, 
spreads to

established benchmarks and

transactions on similar

securities, to

draw correlations based

on the

characteristics of

the 
evaluated instrument. If

for any

reason the pricing

service provider cannot

observe data required

to feed

its model,

it discontinues 
pricing the instrument. During the year

ended December 31, 2024, none of

the Corporation’s debt securities were subject

to pricing 
discontinuance by the

pricing service providers.

The pricing

methodology and approach

of our

primary pricing service

providers is 
concluded to be consistent with the fair value measurement

guidance. 
Furthermore, management assesses the fair value of its

portfolio of investment securities at least on a quarterly

basis. Securities are 
classified

in

the

fair

value

hierarchy

according

to

product

type,

characteristics

and

market

liquidity.

At

the

end

of

each

period, 
management assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. The fair

value measurement analysis performed 

61 
by

the

Corporation

includes

validation

procedures

and

review

of

market

changes,

pricing

methodology,

assumption

and

level 
hierarchy changes, and evaluation of distressed transactions.

Refer to

Note 27

to the

Consolidated Financial Statements for

a description of

the Corporation’s

valuation methodologies used

for 
the assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses

One of

the most

critical and

complex accounting

estimates is

associated with

the determination

of the

allowance for

credit losses 
(“ACL”).

The

Corporation

establishes

an

ACL

for

its

loan

portfolio

based

on

its

estimate

of

credit

losses

over

the

remaining 
contractual term

of the

loans, adjusted

for expected

prepayments, in

accordance with

Accounting Standards

Codification (“ASC”) 
Topic

326.

An

ACL

is

recognized

for

all

loans

including

originated

and

purchased

loans,

since

inception,

with

a

corresponding 
charge to the provision for credit losses, except for purchased

credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. Upon the acquisition of a PCD loan, 
the Corporation recognizes the estimate of the expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of each individual loan as 
an ACL with a corresponding addition to the loan purchase price.

The Corporation follows a methodology to establish

the ACL which 
includes a

reasonable and supportable

forecast period

for estimating credit

losses, considering

quantitative and

qualitative factors 
as well

as the

economic outlook. As

part of

this methodology,

management evaluates various

macroeconomic scenarios provided 
by third parties. At December 31, 2024, management

applied probability weights to the outcome of

the selected scenarios. 
The

Corporation

has

designated

as

collateral

dependent

loans

secured

by

collateral

when

foreclosure

is

probable

or

when 
foreclosure is

not probable but

the practical expedient

is used.

The practical expedient

is used

when repayment is

expected to

be 
provided

substantially

by

the

sale

or

operation

of

the

collateral

and

the

borrower is

experiencing financial

difficulty.

The

ACL

of 
collateral dependent loans

is measured based

on the fair

value of the

collateral less costs

to sell. The

fair value of

the collateral is 
based on appraisals, which may be adjusted due to their

age, and the type, location, and condition of the

property or area or general 
market conditions to reflect the expected change in value between the effective date of the appraisal and the measurement date.

In 
addition,

refer

to

the

Credit

Risk

section

of

this

MD&A

and

to

Note

2

to

the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements

for

detailed 
information on the Corporation’s collateral value estimation

for other real estate. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are

accounted for using the

asset and liability method,

recognizing deferred tax assets and

liabilities based on

future 
tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts

and their respective tax basis. These are 
measured using

enacted tax

rates expected

to apply

when the

temporary differences

are recovered

or paid,

with changes

in tax 
rates recognized in earnings when enacted.

Calculating periodic income taxes involves complexity and

requires estimates and judgments. The Corporation has two accruals for 
income taxes: (i)

the net estimated

amount currently due

or receivable, including any

reserve for potential

examination issues, and 
(ii)

a

deferred

income

tax

reflecting the

estimated

impact

of

temporary differences

between

asset and

liability

recognition under 
GAAP and the tax

code. Differences in actual

future tax consequences could affect

the Corporation’s financial position or

results of 
operations.

In

estimating

taxes,

management

evaluates

the

merits

and

risks

of

appropriate

tax

treatment,

considering

statutory, 
judicial, and regulatory guidance. 
A deferred

tax asset

should be

reduced by

a valuation

allowance if based

on the

weight of

all available evidence,

it is

more likely 
than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or the entire

deferred tax asset will not be realized. A valuation allowance 
should

reduce a

deferred tax

asset to

the amount

likely to

be realized,

considering all

evidence and

sources

of taxable

income, 
including future reversals, future income, carrybacks,

and tax-planning strategies. 
Management evaluates the

realization of the

deferred tax asset

by taxing jurisdiction.

The U.S. mainland

operations are evaluated 
as

a whole

since a

consolidated income

tax return

is filed;

on the

other

hand, the

deferred tax

asset related

to the

Puerto

Rico 
operations

is

evaluated on

an

entity-by-entity basis,

since

no

consolidation is

allowed in

the

income tax

filing.

Accordingly,

this 
evaluation

is

composed

of

three

major

components:

U.S.

mainland

operations,

Puerto

Rico

banking

operations

and

Holding 
Company. 

62 
For the

evaluation of

the realization

of the

deferred tax

asset by

taxing jurisdiction,

refer to

Note 34

to the

Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, the

Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable

entities and are 
not entitled to file

consolidated tax returns. The Code

provides a dividends-received deduction of 100%

on dividends received from 
“controlled” subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico

and 85% on dividends received from other

taxable domestic corporations.

Changes in

the Corporation’s

estimates can occur

due to changes

in tax

rates, new business

strategies, newly

enacted guidance, 
and resolution

of issues

with taxing

authorities regarding

previously taken tax

positions. Such

changes could

affect the

amount of 
accrued taxes. The Corporation has made

tax payments in accordance with

estimated tax payments rules. Any remaining

payment 
will not have any significant impact on liquidity

and capital resources. 
The valuation

of deferred

tax assets

requires judgment

in assessing

the likely

future tax

consequences of

events that

have been 
recognized

in

the

financial

statements

or

tax

returns

and

future

profitability.

The

accounting

for

deferred

tax

consequences 
represents management’s best

estimate of those

future events. Changes

in management’s current

estimates, due to

unanticipated 
events, could have a material impact on the

Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations. 
The Corporation sets tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when it believes it may not realize the tax benefit 
if

challenged,

even

though

it

deems

the

positions

appropriate

under

local

law.

It

evaluates

whether

a

position

is

likely

to

be 
sustained upon

examination based

on its

technical merits.

The ultimate

tax liability

estimate includes

assumptions based

on past 
experiences and

potential actions

by taxing

authorities. The

tax position

is measured

as the

largest amount

of benefit

more than 
50% likely

to be

realized upon settlement.

Each quarter,

the Corporation reviews

and adjusts these

positions based on

new facts, 
audit progress, or statute of limitations expiration.

The Corporation believes its estimates and assumptions

are reasonable. 
The

amount

of

unrecognized

tax

benefits

may

change

due

to

adjustments

for

current

tax

positions,

expiration

of

statutes

of 
limitation, changes in uncertainty assessments, examination status, litigation, legislative activities, and modifications of uncertain tax 
positions.

Despite

the

uncertainty

of

tax

audit

outcomes,

the

Corporation

believes

adequate

provisions

for

tax,

interest,

and 
penalties are maintained. 
The

Corporation

undergoes

periodic

audits

by

federal,

state,

and

local

authorities

concerning

income

tax

matters.

Although 
management

is

confident

in

its

tax

treatment

approach

being

justifiable

and

compliant

with

accounting

standards,

final

tax 
assessments

may

differ

from

recorded

positions

and

reserves.

Adjustments

from

such

audits

are

recorded

in

the

consolidated 
financial statements when

determined. These differences

could impact the

Corporation’s income tax

provision or

benefit, other tax 
reserves, and consequently, its results of operations, financial position, and

cash flows for the respective period. 
Refer to Note 34 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Corporation’s unrecognized tax benefits 
and their possible effect on its effective tax rate. 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
The

Corporation’s

goodwill

and

other

identifiable

intangible

assets

having

an

indefinite

useful

life

are

tested

for

impairment. 
Intangibles

with

indefinite

lives

are

evaluated

for

impairment

at

least

annually,

and

on

a

more

frequent

basis,

if

events

or 
circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place.

Such events could include, among others, a

significant adverse change 
in the business climate, an adverse action by a regulator,

an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to 
change

the

operations

or

dispose

of

a

reporting

unit.

Other

identifiable

intangible

assets

with

a

finite

useful

life

are

evaluated 
periodically for impairment when events or changes

in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount

may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of any

of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up

to the amount of 
the

goodwill.

The

Corporation

estimates

the

fair

value

of

each

reporting

unit,

consistent

with

the

requirements

of

the

fair

value 
measurements

accounting

standard,

generally

using

a

combination

of

methods,

including

market

price

multiples

of

comparable 
companies and

transactions, as

well as

discounted cash

flow analyses.

Subsequent reversal

of goodwill

impairment losses

is not 
permitted under applicable accounting standards.

At December 31, 2024, goodwill amounted to $803.0 million. For a detailed description of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation 
performed by the Corporation during the third quarter

of 2024, refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements. 

63 
Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 
The Corporation provides pension and

restoration benefit plans for certain employees

of various subsidiaries. The Corporation also 
provides certain

health care

benefits for

retired employees of

BPPR. The

non-contributory defined pension

and benefit

restoration 
plans (“the Pension Plans”) are frozen with regards

to all future benefit accruals.

The estimated

benefit costs

and obligations

of the

Pension Plans and

Postretirement Health

Care Benefit Plan

(“OPEB Plan”) are 
impacted by

the use

of subjective

assumptions, which can

materially affect

recorded amounts, including

expected returns on

plan 
assets,

discount

rates,

termination

rates,

retirement

rates

and

health

care

trend

rates.

The

Corporation

uses

an

independent 
actuarial firm for assistance in the determination of the Pension Plans

and OPEB Plan costs and obligations. Detailed information

on 
the Plans and related valuation assumptions are

included in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial

Statements.

The Corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the long-term expected return on Pension Plans

assets. The Pension Plans’ 
assets

fair

value

at

December

31,

2024

was

$617.2

million.

The

expected

return

on

plan

assets

is

determined

by

considering 
various factors,

including a

total funds

return estimate

based on

a weighted-average

of estimated

returns for

each asset

class in 
each plan.

Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and

market factors such as real rates of

return, 
inflation, credit spreads, equity risk premiums and

excess return expectations. 
As part of the review,

the Corporation’s independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns

based on each 
plan’s expected asset

allocation for the year

2025 using the

Willis Towers

Watson US Expected

Return Estimator.

This analysis is 
reviewed by the Corporation

and used as a

tool to develop expected

rates of return, together

with other data. This

forecast reflects 
the actuarial firm’s view of

expected long-term rates of return for each significant asset

class or economic indicator as of January

1, 
2025;

for

example, 8.7%

for

large

cap

stocks,

9.0% for

small cap

stocks,

8.8% for

international stocks,

6.5% for

long

corporate 
bonds

and

5.8%

for

long

Treasury

bonds.

A

range

of

expected

investment

returns

is

developed,

and

this

range

relies

both

on 
forecasts and on broad-market historical benchmarks

for expected returns, correlations, and volatilities

for each asset class. 
As a

consequence of

recent reviews,

the Corporation

updated its

expected return

on plan

assets for

the year

2025 to

5.6% and 
6.7% for the Pension Plans. Expected rates of return for the Pension Plan of 5.6% and 6.6% had been used

for 2024 and 5.9% and 
6.5% had been used for 2023. The expected return

can be materially impacted

by a change in the plan’s asset allocation. 
Net Periodic Benefit Cost

(“pension expense”) for the Pension Plans

amounted to $12.5 million in

2024. The total pension expense 
included a benefit of $34.4 million for the expected

return on assets.

Pension expense is sensitive

to changes in the

expected return on assets.

For example, decreasing the expected

rate of return for 
2025 from

5.6% to

5.35% would

increase the

projected 2025

pension expense

for the

Banco Popular

de Puerto

Rico Retirement 
Plan, the Corporation’s largest plan, by approximately

$1.4

million.

Management believes that

the fair

value estimates of

the Pension Plans

assets are reasonable

given the

valuation methodologies 
used

to

measure

the

investments

at

fair

value

as

described

in

Note

27

to

the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements.

Also,

the 
compositions of the

plan assets

are primarily in

equity and debt

securities, which have

readily determinable quoted

market prices. 
The Corporation had recorded a pension asset

of $33.2 million and a pension liability of $5.8

million at December 31, 2024. 
The Corporation uses

the spot rate

yield curve from

the Willis Towers

Watson RATE:

Link (10/90) Model

to discount the

expected 
projected

cash

flows

of

the

plans.

The

equivalent

single

weighted

average

discount

rate

ranged

from

5.54%

to

5.57%

for

the 
Pension Plans and 5.65% for the OPEB Plan to determine

the benefit obligations at December 31, 2024. 
A 50

basis point

decrease to

each of

the rates

in the

December 31,

2024 Willis

Towers

Watson RATE:

Link (10/90)

Model would 
increase the

projected 2025

expense for

the Banco

Popular de

Puerto Rico

Retirement Plan

by approximately

$1.8

million. The 
change would not affect the minimum required contribution

to the Pension Plans.

The OPEB Plan was unfunded (no assets were held by the plan) at December 31, 2024. The Corporation had recorded a liability for 
the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation of $99.2

million at December 31, 2024.

64 
STATEMENT

OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS 
Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the interest earned from loans, debt securities and money market investments, including loan fees, minus

the 
interest cost of deposits and borrowed money.

Various risk factors

affect net interest income including the economic environment in 
which we operate, market related events, the mix

and size of the earning assets and

related funding, changes in volumes, repricing 
characteristics, loan fees

collected, delay

charges and

interest collected on

nonaccrual loans, as

well as

strategic decisions made 
by the Corporation’s management. 
The average key index rates for the years 2024 and

2023 were as follows: 

2024 
2023 
Prime rate………………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 
8.31% 
8.19% 
SOFR………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. 
5.15% 
5.00% 
Fed funds rate…………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 
5.12% 
5.20% 
3-month Treasury Bill……………………………………………………………………………………………..

10-year Treasury………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 
4.20% 
3.45% 
FNMA 30-year…………………………………………………………………………………………………..… 
5.58% 
4.94% 
Net interest income for the

year ended December 31, 2024 was

$2.3 billion, or $150.8 million

higher than the same period

in 2023. 
Net interest income, on

a taxable equivalent basis

for the year

ended December 31, 2024 was

$2.5 billion compared to $2.3

billion 
in 2023, an increase of $198.5 million. 
Net interest margin in

2024 was 3.24% or 11

basis points higher than the

3.13% reported in 2023. Net interest margin on

a taxable 
equivalent basis

in 2024

was 3.49%

or 18

basis points

higher than the

3.31% reported in

2023. Higher net

interest margin for

the 
year 2024

is primarily

due to

reinvestment in

higher yields

on the

investment securities

portfolio and

growth in

the loan

portfolios 
when compared to 2023. The main factors for the increase

in net interest income on a taxable equivalent

basis were:
●

Higher income from investment securities by $178.4 million driven by higher income from U.S treasuries by $213.5 million 
driven

by

the reinvestment

of

maturities of

US T-Notes

with higher

yields

by

94 basis

points, partially

offset

by

lower 
income from mortgage backed

securities driven by lower

volumes by $695 million

and lower yields by

9 basis points

and 
lower interest

income from

money market investments

by $14.4

million driven

by lower

volume of

$411.2

million, due

to 
the funding of loan growth and investment securities; 
●

Higher interest income from loans by $297.2

million due to: 
o

Higher interest income from commercial loans by $145.7 million

driven by $1.4 billion in higher average volume 
due to loan growth at higher yields by

31 bps, offset in part by the

re-pricing of adjustable-rate loans and higher 
interest income

from construction

loans by

$24.5 million

due to

a higher

volume

by $283.3

million, mainly

in 
Popular U.S; 
o

Higher interest

income from

auto and

lease financing

portfolios by

$57.8 million

driven by

a combined

higher 
volume of $380.0 million and an increase in

yield by 51 bps and 52 bps on each portfolio,

respectively;

o

Higher interest income

from consumer loans

by $35.4 million

resulting from a

higher volume by

$102.5 million 
and a

higher yield

by 79

basis points

in credit

cards, as

well as

an increase

in yield

by 57

basis points

in the 
personal loans portfolio, primarily in BPPR; and 
o

Higher

interest

income

from

mortgage

loans

by

$33.9

million

driven

by

a

higher

average

volume

by

$390.8 
million and higher yield by 15 basis points. 
Partially offset by:
●
Higher interest

expense on

deposits by

$286.1 million,

or 49

basis points,

mainly driven

by higher

deposits across

most 
deposit products,

primarily driven

by interest

bearing demand

deposits of

the P.R

government by

34 basis

points, time 

65 
deposits

by

52

basis

points

in

BPPR

mainly

driven

by

repricing

of

certain

P.R.

government

deposits

managed

by 
Corporation’s fiduciary services division and costs of deposits

in Popular U.S. by 64 basis points.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio

and Unfunded Commitments 
For the year ended December

31, 2024, the Corporation recorded a

provision for credit losses related to

loans held-in-portfolio and 
unfunded commitments of $256.9 million,

compared to $209.7 million for

the year ended December

31, 2023. The provision

for the 
loan

portfolio

for

the

year

2024

was

$258.4

million,

an

increase

of

$56.9

million.

For

the

year

ended

December

31

2024,

the 
Corporation recorded a provision for credit benefit

related to unfunded commitments of $1.5 million,

mainly driven by lower unfunded 
commitments at

PB.

Refer to

Note 9

to

the Consolidated

Financial Statements

for

details of

the

movement of

the allowance

for 
credit losses.

The drivers of

the increase

in the

provision for loan

losses by business

segments when comparing

the year 2024

to 
the year 2023 were as follows: 
●

In

the

BPPR

segment,

the

provision for

loans

losses

increased

by

$59.0

million,

to

$253.8

million

for

the

year

ended 
December 31,

2024. The

increase was

mainly reflected

within the

consumer and

leases portfolios,

driven by

higher net 
charge-offs

and changes

in credit

quality.

During 2024,

the

Corporation implemented

a new

CRE non-owner

occupied 
model, which resulted in lower qualitative reserves for its commercial portfolio. For more information about the new model 
implemented refer to Note 9. 
●

In the Popular U.S. segment, the provision for loans losses decreased

by $2.1 million when compared to the year 2023, to 
$4.6 million

for the

year 2024.

The decrease

was driven by

changes in credit

quality and improvements

in credit

ratings 
related to the commercial portfolio.

At

December

31,

2024,

the

total

allowance

for

credit

losses

for

loans

held-in-portfolio amounted

to

$746.0

million,

compared

to 
$729.3

million

as

of

December

31,

2023.

The

ratio

of

the

allowance

for

credit

losses

to

loans

held-in-portfolio

was

2.01%

at 
December

31,

2024, compared

to

2.08%

at

December 31,

2023. Refer

to

Note

8

to

the

Consolidated Financial

Statements, for 
additional

information

on

the

Corporation’s

methodology

to

estimate

its

ACL

and

to

the

Credit

Risk

section

of

this

MD&A

for

a 
detailed analysis of net charge-offs, non-performing assets,

the allowance for credit losses and selected loan

losses statistics. 
Non-Interest Income 
For the

year ended

December 31,

2024, non-interest

income was $658.9

million, an

increase of

$8.2 million

when compared with 
the previous year. Factors that contributed to the variance in non-interest

income were: 
●

higher other service fees by

$14.8 million mainly due to higher debit and

credit card fees by $8.5 million,

driven by higher 
customer purchase activity and higher commissions

from investment management and advisory fees by $6.9

million; and 
●

higher service

charges on

deposit accounts

by $3.9

million mainly

due to

an increase

in

non-balance compensation

in 
commercial accounts; 
partially offset by: 
●

lower income from equity securities by

$5.1 million, mainly due to

an unfavorable variance of $2.7 million

in the fair value 
adjustment of equity

securities related to

the deferred benefits

plans, which have

an offsetting

effect in

higher personnel 
cost, and impairment losses on equity securities

of $2.3 million recognized during 2024; 
●

lower other operating income by $2.5 million, mainly due

to the receipt of $5.6 million in insurance claim proceeds

in 2023, 
partially offset by higher service fees on other real estate

managed;

and 
●

lower mortgage banking activities by $2.4 million, mainly due to an unfavorable variance in mortgage servicing fees driven 
by

serviced

loan

portfolio

runoff

due

to

the

Corporation’s

determination

to

retain

certain

guaranteed

loans

as

held

for 
investment. 
Effective December 1, 2024, Popular Auto LLC,

a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico,

completed the sale of 
its daily car

rental business. Daily

rental car units

and other related

assets totaling approximately

$52.1 million in

book value were 
transferred to the

purchaser at closing at

near book value. Revenues

from the car

rental business which,

included daily rental fees 

68 
as well the

gains from the sale

of car rental

units, presented as part

of Other Operating Income

in the accompanying Consolidated 
Statements of Operation, for the year ended December 31, 2024 amounted to $27.7 million, a decrease of $4.8 million compared to 
the previous year.

Adjusting for the expense savings

expected as a result

of this transaction, the impact

to the consolidated results 
is not material to the Corporation.

Operating Expenses 
Operating expenses for the

year ended December 31,

2024 totaled $1.9 billion,

including $6.4 million of

interest accrued related to 
prior period

tax withholdings

and the

$14.3 million

impact of

the FDIC

Special Assessment,

which for

the year

2023 was

of $71.4 
million. Excluding the effect of these aforementioned items in 2024 and

2023, total expenses for 2024 were $1.8 billion, an increase 
of $40.3

million, when compared with the previous year. The

other factors that contributed to the variance in operating expenses for 
the year were: 
●

higher personnel

costs

by

$42.4 million

mainly

due

to

higher salaries

expenses by

$23.9

million

as a

result

of

annual 
salary

revisions

and

an

increase

in

headcount,

and

higher

commissions

and

incentives,

including

restricted

stock 
compensation by $13.4 million; 
●

higher technology and software expenses by

$38.4 million mainly due to higher software

amortization expenses by $11.7 
million,

higher

IT

professional fees

of

$11.1

million

related

to

the

Corporation's

transformation initiative,

a

$9.8

million 
increase in network management services and an increase

of $3.9 million in application processing and

hosting services; 
●

higher other

taxes expense

by $10.1

million mainly

due to

an increase

in municipal

license tax

and to

the impact

of the 
reversal of $8.2 million in 2023 of regulatory examination

fees in BPPR; 
●

higher business promotion expenses by $7.0 million mainly

due to higher credit card customer rewards programs

expense 
reflecting an increase in customer purchase activity;

and 
●

higher other

processing and

transactional services

expenses by

$4.6 million

mainly due

to higher

credit and

debit card 
processing expense as a result of higher transactional

volumes. 
These variances were partially offset by: 
●

lower

professional fees

by

$35.3 million

mainly

due

to

lower legal

fees

and

lower

consulting

fees

related

to

corporate 
initiatives; 
●

a non-cash goodwill impairment of $23.0 million recorded

during 2023 in our U.S. based equipment leasing

subsidiary due 
to lower forecasted cash flows and an increase in

the rate used to discount cash flows; and 
●

lower equipment expense by

$3.6 million, mainly due

to lower rental vehicle

fleet depreciation expense as

a result of the 
sale of the car rental business.

Income Taxes 
For the

year ended

December 31,

2024, the

Corporation recorded an

income tax

expense of

$182.4 million,

compared to

$134.2 
million for the year 2023.

The increase of $48.2 million was attributed to higher

income before tax, the $16.5 million tax withholding 
expense recorded in the

first quarter of 2024

related to intercompany distributions for

the years 2014-2023, and

the additional $6.4 
million

tax

expense

related

to

a

distribution

completed

during

that

quarter.

These

variances

were

partially

offset

by

higher

net 
exempt income. 
At December

31, 2024,

the Corporation

had a

net deferred

tax asset

amounting to

$924.8 million, net

of a

valuation allowance

of 
$456.8 million. The net

deferred tax asset related

to the U.S. operations

was $253.4 million, net

of a valuation allowance

of $386.9 
million.

Fourth Quarter Operational Results 
●

For

the

quarter

ended

December

31,

2024,

the

Corporation

recorded

net

income

of

$177.8

million,

compared

to

net 
income

of

$94.6

million

for

the

same

quarter

of

the

previous year.

Net

interest

income

for

the

fourth

quarter

of

2024 
amounted to $590.8

million, compared with

$534.2

million for the

fourth quarter of

2023. The increase of

$56.6 million in 
net interest

income was mainly

due to

higher interest income

from loans,

due to

growth across most

portfolios at BPPR 
and the commercial and construction portfolios in PB combined with higher rates by $9.8 million, lower cost of deposits by 
$3.5

million,

primarily

in

P.R.

Government

deposits

and

online

deposits

in

PB,

and

higher

income

from

investment 
securities; partially offset by lower income from money market investments due to lower average balances by $736 million 
and yields by 67 bps.

The net interest margin increased by 27 basis points to 3.35% mainly due to an increase in the yield 
for

loans

and

investment securities

due

to

higher rates.

On

a

taxable equivalent

basis,

the

net interest

margin for

the 
fourth quarter of 2024 was 3.62%, compared to

3.26% for the fourth quarter of 2023. 
●

The provision for

loan losses was

$69.1 million for

the fourth quarter

of 2024, compared

to a provision

expense of $75.2 
million for the same quarter of the previous year. The decrease of $6.1 million

was driven by a lower provision expense

for 
loans, mainly attributed to improved credit metrics at the commercial and

construction portfolios and the implementation of 
a

new

model

for

CRE

non-owner-occupied-loans in

Puerto

Rico,

partially

offset

by

higher

provision

for

the

consumer 
portfolio

due

to

increased delinquencies

and

NCOs.

The

reserve

release for

unfunded commitments

was $2.9

million, 
lower by $6.6 million, mainly due to lower reserve

needs for unfunded commitments

in PB. 
●

Non-interest income amounted to $164.7 million for

the quarter ended December 31, 2024,

compared with $168.7 million 
for the same quarter in 2023. The decrease

of $4.0 million was mainly due to lower

income from equity securities by $4.8 
million driven by the valuation of securities held for deferred benefit plans, which have an offset effect

on personnel costs, 
partially offset

by higher

other service

fees by

$2.7 million,

driven by

higher commissions from

investment management 
and advisory fees. 
●

Operating expenses totaled $467.6 million for the quarter

ended December 31, 2024, compared with $531.1

million for the 
same

quarter

in

the

previous

year.

The

decrease

is

mainly

related

to

the

$71.4

million

FDIC

Special

Assessment 
recognized

during the

fourth

quarter

of

2023;

partially offset

by

higher personnel

costs

by

$11.1

million due

to

annual 
salary revisions and higher incentive compensation. 
●

For the quarter

ended December 31,

2024, the Corporation

recorded an income tax

expense of $43.9

million, compared 
with an income tax benefit of $1.5 million for the

same quarter of 2023. The unfavorable variance was mostly attributed to 
a higher income before tax, mainly due to

the FDIC Special Assessment recorded in the

fourth quarter of 2023. 
REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 
The Corporation’s

reportable segments

for managerial

reporting purposes

consist of

Banco Popular

de Puerto

Rico and

Popular 
U.S. A Corporate group has been defined to

support the reportable segments.

For

a

description

of

the

Corporation’s

reportable

segments,

including

additional

financial

information

and

the

underlying 
management accounting process, refer to Note 36

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Corporate

group reported

a net

loss of

$19.0 million

for the

year ended

December 31,

2024, compared with

a net

income of 
$13.3 million for

the previous year.

The negative variance

was primarily the

result of the

$22.9 million adjustment

to recognize the 
tax

impact,

including

the

related

interest,

associated

with

prior

period intercompany

distributions,

and

the

additional

$6.5

million 
recognized for the tax impact related to intercompany

distributions paid during the first quarter

of 2024.

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable

segments are discussed below: 
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico

71 
The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment’s

net income amounted to $555.7

million for the year ended December 31, 
2024, compared with $472.0 million for the year ended

December 31, 2023. The principal factors that

contributed to the variance in 
the financial results included the following:

●

Higher net interest income by $144.9 million due

to higher interest income from loans by $225.7

million, or 31 basis 
points, driven by higher average balances resulting

primarily from portfolio growth in the commercial,

auto and personal 
loans by 31 basis points, and higher interest

income from money market and investment securities

by $69.9 million, or 34 
basis points; due to the re-investment of maturities

in higher yielding securities, mainly U.S. Treasuries; partially

offset by 
higher interest expense on deposits by $149.9

million, or 37 basis points;

mainly due to higher costs of P.R. government 
deposits. The BPPR segment’s net interest margin was 3.43%

for 2024 compared with 3.20% for the same

period in 
2023; 
●

A provision for loan losses of $253.6 million

in 2024, compared to $195.1 million for the

year ended 2023, or an 
unfavorable variance of $58.5 million, due to the consumer

portfolios, driven by higher net charge-offs and

higher loan 
balances in addition to higher reserves for credit card

and leasing portfolios, driven by changes

in credit quality; During 
2024, the Corporation implemented a new CRE

non-owner occupied model, which resulted in

lower qualitative reserves 
for its commercial portfolio; 
●

A higher provision for unfunded commitments by

$1.4 million driven by the commercial portfolio; 
●

Higher non-interest income by $9.6 million mainly

due to: 
●

Higher other service fees by $12.3 million due

to higher debit and credit card fees by $8.2

million as result of 
higher volume of transactions;

and 
●

Higher service charges on deposit accounts by $3.9

million principally due to higher fees from non-balance 
compensation in commercial deposits. 
partially offset by 
●

Lower mortgage banking activities by $2.5 million

mainly due to an unfavorable variance of $2.6

million in 
mortgage service fees, driven by portfolio runoff, due

to the Corporation’s determination to retain certain 
guaranteed loans as held for investment;.and 
●

Lower other operating income by $2.7 million mostly

due to an insurance policy reimbursement

gain on 2023. 
●

Lower operating expenses by $0.5 million, mainly

due to:

●

Lower FDIC deposit insurance expense by $49.0

million due to FDIC Special Assessment expense

of $12.7 
million in the year 2024, compared to $63.5 million

in 2023; 
●

Lower professional fees by $20.4 million mainly due

to lower legal expenses and lower consulting fees 
associated with several corporate initiatives; 
●

Lower equipment expenses by $3.8 million mainly

due to a decrease in daily rental vehicle

fleet depreciation as 
a result of the sale of the daily car

rental business; and 
●

Higher net recoveries from OREO by $2.9 million

mainly due to an increase in gains from the

sale of residential 
and commercial OREO properties; 
Partially offset by:

●

Higher personnel costs by $30.1 million due to

annual salary revisions, an increase in headcount;

and higher 
commissions and incentives, including restricted share

compensation; 

72 
●

Higher technology and software expenses by $21.9

million mainly due to higher amortization of

software, higher 
IT consulting fees, higher network management fees

and higher application and hosting services; 
●

Higher other taxes expenses by $9.9 million

mainly due to an increase in municipal license

tax and the impact 
of the reversal of $8.2 million in 2023

of regulatory examination fees; 
●

Higher business promotions by $6.1 million mainly

due to higher credit cards customer rewards expense

as a 
result of an increase in customer purchase activity, and higher advertising

and sponsorship expenses; and 
●

Higher processing and transactional services by $4.8

million mainly due to higher credit and debit

card 
processing expense due to higher transaction volume. 
●

Higher income tax expense.by $10.8 million due to higher

income before tax, partially offset by higher exempt

income. 
Popular U.S.

For the

year ended

December 31, 2024, Popular

U.S. reported

net income

of $77.6

million, compared with

a net

income of

$56.3 
million for the year ended

December 31, 2023. The principal factors

that contributed to the variance

in the financial results included 
the following:

●

Higher net

interest income

by $5.4

million mainly

due to

higher interest

income from

loans by

$68.8 million,

or 33

basis 
points, mainly from growth in the commercial and

construction portfolio with higher yields, and higher income from money 
market and investment securities by $57.5 million,

or 59 basis points, due to

re-investment in higher yields, mainly due to 
higher cost of deposits by

64 basis points; partially offset by

higher interest expense on deposits by $124.6

million mainly 
due to higher average balances

of high cost deposits, primarily time deposit through the online channel. The Popular U.S. 
reportable segment’s net interest margin was 2.66%

for 2024 compared with 2.98% for the same period

in 2023; 
●

A favorable

variance of

$2.1 million

on the

provision for

loan losses,

mainly due

to a

lower provision

in the

construction 
and consumer portfolios, partially offset

by an increase in

provision for the mortgage and

commercial portfolios, reflective 
of changes in credit quality; 
●

A

favorable

variance

of

$11.1

million

in

the

provision

for

unfunded

commitments

mainly

related

to

the

construction 
portfolio; 
●

Higher non-interest income by $1.4 million mainly

due to higher insurance fees; and 
●

Lower operating expenses by $16.7 million mainly

due to:

●

The impact of the

$23.0 million goodwill impairment charge

recorded in 2023 related to

our U.S. based leasing 
subsidiary; 
●

Lower FDIC deposit insurance

expense by $2.3 million

due to the

lower FDIC Special Assessment

expense of 
$1.6 million

in the

year 2024, compared

to $7.9

million in

2023, partially offset

by a

higher assessment rate

in 
2024; and 
●

Lower occupancy expense by

$1.8 million due to

a decrease in

amortization mainly due to

early termination of 
contracts in the year 2023; 
Partially offset by:

●

Higher other expenses by $6.7 million due to higher

charges allocated from the Corporate segment group;

and 

73 
●

Higher personnel costs by $2.0 million due to annual

salary revisions and an increase in headcount; 
●

Higher income tax expense by $15.4 million due

mainly due to higher pre-tax income. 
STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS

Assets 
The Corporation’s total

assets were $73.0 billion

at December 31, 2024,

compared to $70.8 billion

at December 31, 2023.

Refer to 
the Corporation’s

Consolidated Statements of

Financial Condition

at December

31, 2024

and 2023

included in

this Form

additional

information.

Also,

the

Statistical

Summary

2024-2023

in

this

MD&A

for

Condensed

Statements

of

Financial 
Condition.

Money market investments and debt securities 
Money market investments

decreased by $617.9

million at December

31, 2024,

when compared to

December 31,

2023. This was 
mainly driven by use of funding

for loan growth. Debt securities available-for-sale increased $1.5

billion, mainly due to reinvestment 
in

U.S.

Treasury

Securities.

Debt

securities

held-to-maturity

decreased

by

$436.3

million

driven

by

maturities

and

paydowns, 
partially offset

by the

amortization of

$179.6 million

of the

discount related

to U.S.

Treasury securities

previously reclassified from 
available-for-sale (“AFS”) to held-to-maturity (“HTM”). Refer to Notes

5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information with respect to the Corporation’s debt securities

available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 
Loans 
Refer to Table

7 for a breakdown of

the Corporation’s loan portfolio. Also,

refer to Note 7

to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for detailed information about the Corporation’s loan portfolio

composition and loan purchases and sales. 
Loans

held-in-portfolio increased

by

$2.0

billion to

$37.1

billion

at

December

31,

2024,

mainly

due

to

growth in

the

commercial 
portfolio of

$952.4 million,

reflected at

both BPPR

and PB

by $785.5

million and

$166.9 million,

respectively,

growth in

mortgage 
loans at BPPR by $418.1 million, as the Corporation continued

to retain in portfolio FHA-guaranteed mortgage loan

originations,

and 
growth

in

construction

loans

at

PB

by

$262.1

million.

Consumer

loans

at

BPPR

increased

by

$228.5

million

in

the

aggregate, 
including credit cards and auto loans. 
The Corporation’s

$5.3 billion

non-owner occupied commercial

real estate

portfolio is comprised

of $3.2

billion in

Puerto Rico

and 
$2.1 billion in the U.S. and is

well diversified across a number of tenants in different industries

and segments with exposure to retail 
(33%

of

non-owner

occupied

CRE),

hotels

(19%)

and

office

space

(13%)

accounting

for

two

thirds

of

the

total

exposure.

With 
approximate $714 million, CRE office space loan exposure represents

only 1.9% of the total loan portfolio and it is comprised mainly 
of mid-rise properties with diversified tenants with

average loan size of $2.4 million across both the

U.S. and Puerto Rico. 

Popular’s $2.4 billion commercial multi-family portfolio represents approximately 6% of the total loan portfolio, which is concentrated 
in the

New York

Metro ($1.5

billion), South

Florida ($672

million) and

Puerto Rico

($216 million)

geographic regions.

In the

New 
York Metro region, the Corporation has no exposure to rent controlled buildings. The rent stabilized units represent less than 40% of 
the total units in the loan portfolio and the majority

are from vintages after 2019.

The

variance

was

mainly

driven

by

a

decrease

of

$161.4

million

in

cash

receivable

from

the

maturities

of

investment 
securities. Refer to Note

for a breakdown of

the principal categories that comprise

the 
caption of “Other Assets” in the Consolidated

Statements of Financial Condition at December

31, 2024 and 2023. 
Liabilities 
The Corporation’s

total liabilities were

$67.4 billion

at December

31, 2024,

an increase

of $1.8

billion compared to

$65.6 billion

at 
December 31, 2023, mainly due to an increase in deposits as discussed below. Refer to the

Corporation’s Consolidated Statements 
of Financial Condition included in this Form 10-K.

Deposits and Borrowings 
Deposits 
The

Corporation’s

deposits

totaled

$64.9

billion

at

December

31,

2024,

compared

to

$63.6

billion

at

December

31,

2023.

This 
increase of $1.3 billion was mainly in Puerto Rico,

driven by P.R. Government deposits

as well as time deposits at PB.

Excluding P.R.

Government deposits, as of December 31, 2024, deposits amounted to $45.4 billion, compared to

$45.6 billion as of 
December

31,

2023.

This

$0.2

billion

decrease

included

a

reduction

of

approximately

$0.4

billion

in

savings,

NOW

and

money 
market deposits and of

$0.3 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits,

partially offset by

a $0.5 billion increase

in higher cost interest-
bearing deposits, mainly related to time deposits

in Popular Bank.

In

BPPR, deposit

balances, excluding

P.R

government funds,

have been

impacted during

2023

and 2024

by

outflows driven

by 
changes in client behavior, mainly by commercial and affluent retail clients seeking products that provide for high

rates in the current 
rate environment,

along with

significant spending

and use

of balances

including the

retail client

base, which

had experienced

an 

75 
increase in average deposit balances since the pandemic driven by U.S. government incentives, tax refunds and increased average 
wages.

Notwithstanding this decrease in total balances,

average retail deposit balances per retail client at BPPR are still higher than 
pre-pandemic levels. 
P.R.

Government deposits

amounted to $19.5 billion

at December 31, 2024,

compared to $18.1 billion

at December 31, 2023.

The 
receipt by the Puerto

Rico Government of additional federal

assistance, and seasonal tax collections, could

increase public deposit 
balances at

BPPR in

the near

term. However,

the rate

at which

public deposit

balances may

change is

uncertain and

difficult to 
predict. The

amount and

timing of

any such

change is

likely to

be impacted

by,

for example,

the level

of federal

assistance and 
speed at which

any federal assistance is

distributed, the financial condition, liquidity

and cash management practices

of the Puerto 
Rico

Government

and

its

instrumentalities

and

the

implementation

of

fiscal

and

debt

adjustment

plans

approved

pursuant

to 
PROMESA or

other

actions

mandated by

the

Fiscal

Oversight and

Management Board

for Puerto

Rico

(the

“Oversight Board”). 
Additionally,

the Trump

Administration is

conducting a

review of

federal funding,

which could

entail a

reduction in

federal funding 
available for Puerto Rico. 
Approximately 30% of

the Corporation’s

deposits are

public fund deposits

from the

Government of Puerto

Rico, municipalities and 
government instrumentalities and corporations (“public funds’’).

These public funds deposits are

indexed to short-term market

rates 
and generally fluctuate in cost with changes in

those rates with a one-quarter lag, in accordance with

contractual terms. As a result, 
these deposits’ costs

have tipically lagged

variable asset repricing.

These deposits require

that the

bank pledge high

credit quality 
securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower.

Refer to the Liquidity section in 
this MD&A for additional information on the Corporation’s

funding sources. 
Refer to Table 8 for a breakdown of the Corporation’s deposits at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Borrowings 
The Corporation’s borrowings amounted to $1.2

billion at December 31, 2024, compared to

$1.1 billion at December 31,

2023. The 
increase was mainly

due to FHLB

advances balances which

increase by $133.1

million, including short

and long term

borrowings, 
partially

offset

by

lower

repurchase

commitments.

Stockholders’ Equity 
Stockholders’ equity totaled

$5.6 billion at

December 31, 2024,

an increase of

$0.5 billion when

compared to December

31, 2023. 
The increase was principally due to net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $614.2 million, coupled with the change in 
accumulated

other

comprehensive

loss

driven

by

the

amortization

of

unrealized losses

from

securities

previously

reclassified to 
HTM of

$143.7 million,

net of

taxes, and

the decrease

in net

unrealized losses

in the

portfolio of

AFS securities

of $74.3

million, 
partially offset

by an

increase in

Treasury

Stock mainly

due to

the repurchases

of 2,256,420

shares of

common stock

for $217.3 
million during the year

as part of the previously

announced $500 million share repurchase authorization,

including the regulatory capital ratios of BPPR

and PB. 
An institution

is considered “well-capitalized”

if it

maintains a total

capital ratio

of 10%,

a Tier

1 capital ratio

of 8%,

a CET1 capital 
ratio

of

6.5%

and

a

leverage

ratio

of

5%.

The

Corporation’s

ratios

presented

in

Table
10

show

that

the

Corporation

was

“well 
capitalized” for

regulatory purposes,

the highest

classification, under

Basel III

for years

2024 and

2023. BPPR

and PB

were also 
well-capitalized for all the years presented. 
The

Basel

III

Capital

Rules

also

require

an

additional

2.5%

“capital

conservation

buffer”,

composed entirely

of

CET1,

on

top

of 
minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, which excludes the leverage ratio. The capital conservation buffer is

designed to absorb losses 
during periods of

economic stress. Banking

institutions with a

ratio of CET1

to risk-weighted assets

above the minimum

but below 
the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation

based on the amount of the 
shortfall. Popular,

BPPR and

PB are

required to

maintain this

additional capital

conservation buffer

of 2.5%

of CET1,

resulting in 
minimum ratios

of (i) CET1

to risk-weighted

assets of

at least

7%, (ii) Tier

1 capital

to risk-weighted

assets of

at least

8.5%, and 
(iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.

The decrease in the CET1 capital ratio,

Tier 1 capital ratio

and, total capital ratio as of

December 31, 2024, compared to December 
31,

2023,
was

due

primarily

to

an

increase

in

risk

weighted

assets

as

a

result

of

loan

growth

in

the

commercial

loans

held-in-
portfolio,

and

the

repurchase

of

shares

under

the

common

stock

repurchase

authorization

plan,

partially

offset

by

the

annual 
earnings. The increase in the leverage capital ratio was mainly due to the

increase in capital driven by the annual earnings, partially 
offset by an increase in average total assets. 
Pursuant

to

the

adoption

of

CECL

on

January

1,

2020,

the

Corporation elected

to

use

the

five-year

transition

period

option

as 
provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective March

31, 2020. The five-year transition period provision delays for two 
years the

estimated impact

of

CECL on

regulatory capital,

followed by

a three-year

transition period

to

phase out

the aggregate 
amount of

the capital benefits

provided during the

initial two-year delay.

As of

December 31, 2024,

the Corporation had

phased-in 
75% of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be

recognized over the next year. In

the first quarter of 2025, the 
Corporation will phase in all of the cumulative deferral.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
Market / Interest Rate Risk 
The Corporation’s assets that are mainly subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Refer to 
Notes 5 and 6 to

the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on

the debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-
maturity portfolios.

Debt securities

classified as

available-for-sale and

held-to-maturity amounted

to

$18.2 billion

and

$7.8 billion, 
respectively,

as

of

December

31,

2024.

Other

assets

subject

to

market

risk

include

loans

held-for-sale,

which

amounted

to

$5 
million, mortgage servicing

rights (“MSRs”) which

amounted to $108

million, and securities

classified as “trading”,

which amounted 
to $33 million, each as of December 31, 2024.

Interest Rate Risk (“IRR”) 
The Corporation’s net interest income is subject

to various categories of interest rate risk,

including repricing, basis, yield curve and 
option risks.

In managing

interest rate

risk, management may

alter the

mix of

floating and

fixed rate

assets and

liabilities, change 
pricing

schedules,

adjust

maturities

through

sales

and

purchases

of

investment

securities,

and

enter

into

derivative

contracts, 
among other alternatives.

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest

Income (“NII”) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 
Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) to monitor the risk arising from the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities subject to IRR. 
The

three

methodologies complement

each

other

and

are

used jointly

in

the

evaluation of

the

Corporation’s IRR.

NII simulation 
modeling is prepared for a five-year period, which in conjunction with the EVE analysis, provides management a better view of long-
term IRR. 
Net

interest

income

simulation

analysis

performed by

legal

entity and

on

a

consolidated

basis

is

used

to

estimate the

potential 
change

in

net

interest

income

resulting

from

hypothetical

changes

in

interest

rates.

Sensitivity

analysis

is

calculated

using

a 
simulation model which incorporates actual balance

sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest

yields or costs.

Management assesses interest rate

risk by comparing various

NII simulations under different

interest rate scenarios to

assess the, 
degree of

change and

the projected

shape of

the yield

curve. Management

also performs

analyses to

isolate and

measure basis 
and

prepayment

risk

exposures.

These

models

are

periodically

monitored.

Assumptions

are

validated

by

management

and

are 
subject to independent validations according to the Corporations’

Model Governance Policy. 
The Corporation processes NII

simulations under interest rate

scenarios in which the

yield curve is assumed

to rise and

decline by 
the same magnitude

(parallel shifts). The

rate scenarios considered in

these market risk

simulations include instantaneous parallel 
changes of

-100,

-200, +100,

and +200

basis points

during the

succeeding twelve-month

period. Assumptions

included in

these 
analyses

include

that

the

balance

sheet

remains

flat,

relative

levels

of

market

interest

rates

across

all

yield

curve

points

and 
indexes, interest rate spreads, loan

prepayments and deposit elasticity.

Thus, they should not be

relied upon as indicative of

actual 
results

and

do

not

contemplate

actions

that

management

may

engage

in

as

a

response

to

future

changes

in

interest

rates. 
Additionally,

the Corporation

is also

subject to

the risk

inherent in

the use

of different

rate indexes

for the

repricing of

assets and 
liabilities, as well the

risk of pricing lags

due to contractual or

timing differences between the

market and management response

to 
changes

in

the

rate

environment.

These

forward-looking

computations

are

management’s

best

estimate

based

on

known

and 
available information and actual results may differ. The following table presents the

results of the simulations at December 31, 2024 
and December 31, 2023, assuming a static balance

sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates

over a one-year time horizon:

As

of

December

31,

2024,

NII

simulations

show

the

Corporation

maintains

an

asset

sensitive

position

that

is

slightly

more 
pronounced

in

the

rising

rates

scenarios

and

closer

to

neutral

in

the

declining

scenarios.

Sensitivity

variation

and

the

resulting 
sensitivity profile

are mainly driven

by changes

in balance sheet

composition,

including those

of short-term

U.S Treasury

Bills (“T- 
Bills”),

and

higher

loan

balances,

partially

offset

by

higher

market-linked

Puerto

Rico

public

sector

deposits,

changes

in

the 
composition

and

mix

of

deposits

and

a

reduction

in

overnight

Fed

Funds.

During

the

year

ended

on

December

31,

2024,

the 
Corporation began to reinvest excess reserves and some of the proceeds of the maturing portfolio into U.S Treasury Notes. In more 
severe declining

rate scenarios,

the negative

impact on

net interest

income due

to the

repricing of

short-term assets

and variable 
rate

loans

would

slightly

exceed

the

benefit

in

cost

reduction

of

these

deposits.

In

rising

rate

scenarios,

Popular’s

net

interest 
income would also

be impacted due

to its large

proportion of Puerto Rico

public sector deposit, however

the repricing of

assets as 
they either reset or mature would lead to an

increase in net interest income. 
The

Corporation’s

loan

and

investment

portfolios

are

subject

to

prepayment

risk.

Prepayment

risk

also

could

have

a

significant 
impact on the duration of mortgage-backed securities

and collateralized mortgage obligations.

At December 31, 2024,

the Corporation held trading securities

with a fair value

The Corporation’s trading activities are limited by internal policies.

For each of the three subsidiaries, the market risk

assumed under 
trading

activities

is

measured

by

the

5-day

net

value-at-risk

(“VAR”),

with

a

confidence

level

of

99%.

The

VAR

measures

the 
maximum estimated loss that may occur over a

5-day holding period, given a 99% probability.

The Corporation’s

trading portfolio had

a 5-day

VAR

of approximately $0.6

million for

the last

week of

December 2024. There

are 
numerous assumptions

and estimates

associated with

VAR

modeling, and

actual results

could differ

from these

assumptions and 
estimates. Back testing

is performed to

compare actual results

against maximum estimated losses,

in order to

evaluate model and 
assumptions accuracy.

The size and composition of the trading portfolio

does not represent a significant source of market

risk for the Corporation. 
Foreign Exchange 
The Corporation holds

an interest in

BHD León

in the

Dominican Republic, which

is an investment

accounted for under

the equity 
method. The

Corporation’s carrying

value of

the equity

interest in

BHD León

approximated $239.5

million at

December 31,

2024.

This business is conducted in

the country’s foreign currency.

The resulting foreign currency translation

adjustment, from operations 
for which the functional

currency is other than

the U.S. dollar,

is reported in accumulated

other comprehensive income (loss) in

the 
consolidated

statements

of

condition,

except

for

highly-inflationary

environments

in

which

the

effects

would

be

included

December 31,

2024, the

Corporation had

approximately $71 million

in

an

unfavorable 
foreign currency translation

adjustment as part

of accumulated other

comprehensive income (loss),

compared with an

unfavorable 
adjustment of $ 65 million at December 31,

Liquidity 
Liquidity Risk Management Process 
The Corporation

has adopted

policies and

limits to

monitor the

Corporation’s liquidity

position and

that of

its banking

subsidiaries. 
Refer

to

the

Enterprise

Risk

Management

section

of

Management’s

Discussion

and

Analysis

included

in

this

Form

10-K

for 
information on

the approval

of policies

to manage

liquidity risk.

Additionally,

contingency funding

plans are

used to

model various 
stressful

events

of

different

magnitudes

that

affect

different

time

horizons,

to

assist

management

in

evaluating

the

size

of

the 
liquidity

buffers

needed

if

those

stress

events

occur.

However,

such

models

may

not

predict

accurately

how

the

market

and 
customers might react

to every event

and are dependent

on many assumptions. The

objective of effective

liquidity management is 
to

ensure that

the Corporation

has sufficient

liquidity to

meet

all of

its

financial obligations,

finance expected

future growth,

fund 
planned

capital

distributions

and

maintain

a

reasonable

safety

margin

for

cash

needs

under

both

normal

and

stressed

market 
conditions. 
Sources of Liquidity 
Deposits, including

customer deposits,

brokered deposits

and public

funds deposits,

continue to

be the

most significant

source of 
funds

for

the

Corporation,

representing

89%

and

90%

of

funding

of

the

Corporation’s

total

assets

at

December

31,

2024

and 
December 31, 2023, respectively.

The ratio of total ending loans to deposits was 57% at December 31, 2024 and 55% at December 
31, 2023.

In addition to

traditional deposits, the

Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which

amounted to approximately 
$1.2

billion

in

outstanding

balances

at

December

31,

2024

(December

31,

2023

-

$1.1

Banking Subsidiaries 
Primary

sources of

funding

for the

Corporation’s

banking subsidiaries

(BPPR and

PB

or,

collectively,

“the banking

subsidiaries”) 
include

retail,

commercial

and

public

sector

deposits,

brokered

deposits,

unpledged

investment

securities,

mortgage

loan 
securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In

addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the 
discount window

of the

Federal Reserve

Bank of

New York

(the “FRB”)

and has

a considerable

amount of

collateral pledged

that 
can be used to raise funds under these facilities. 
During the fourth quarter of 2024 the Corporation had no material incremental use of its available liquidity sources. At December 31, 
2024, the Corporation’s available liquidity increased to

$ 21.6 billion from $19.5 billion

on December 31, 2023. The liquidity sources 
of the Corporation at December 31, 2024 are

Refer

to

Note

16

to

the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements

for

additional

information

of

the

Corporation’s

borrowing

facilities 
available through its banking subsidiaries.

The principal

uses of

funds for

the banking

subsidiaries include

loan originations,

investment portfolio

purchases, loan

purchases 
and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 
expenses. Also, the

banking subsidiaries assume liquidity

risk related to collateral

posting requirements for certain

activities mainly 
in

connection

with

contractual

commitments,

recourse

provisions,

servicing

advances,

derivatives

and

credit

card

licensing 
agreements.

The banking

subsidiaries maintain

sufficient funding

capacity to

address large

increases in

funding requirements

such as

deposit 
outflows.

The

Corporation has

established

liquidity

guidelines

that

require

the

banking

subsidiaries

to

have

sufficient

liquidity

to 
cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits.

Deposits are

a key

source of

funding. Refer

to Table

8 for

a breakdown

of deposits

by major

types. Core

deposits are

generated 
from a large base of consumer, corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits

include certificates

of deposit under $250,000, 
all

interest-bearing

transactional

deposit

accounts,

non-interest-bearing

deposits,

and

savings

deposits.

Core

deposits

exclude 
brokered

deposits

and

certificates

of

deposit

over

$250,000.

Core

deposits,

excluding

P.R.

public

funds,

which

are

fully 
collateralized, have

historically provided

the Corporation

with a

sizable source

of relatively

stable and

low-cost funds.

P.R.

public 
funds, while linked to market interest rates, provide a stable source of funding

with an attractive earning spread. As of December 31, 
2024, total Puerto Rico public sector deposits were

$19.5 billion, compared to $18.1 billion at

December 31, 2023. 
Core deposits

totaled $59.9

billion, or

92% of

total deposits,

at December

31, 2024,

compared with

$59.0 billion,

or 93%

of total 
deposits, at December 31, 2023. Core deposits financed 86% of the Corporation’s earning assets at December 31, 2024, compared 
with 88% at December 31, 2023. 
The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposit with denominations of $250,000 and over at December 31, 2024 is presented in 
the table that follows:

The Corporation had

$1.6 billion in

brokered deposits at

December 31, 2024,

which financed approximately

2% of its

total assets 
(December 31, 2023 - $1.7 billion and 2%,

respectively).

As of

December 31,

2024, the

banking subsidiaries

had sufficient

current and

projected liquidity

sources to

meet their

anticipated 
cash flow

obligations, as

well as

special needs

and off-balance

sheet commitments,

in the

ordinary course

of business

and have 
sufficient

liquidity

resources to

address

a

stress

event.

Although the

banking

subsidiaries

have

historically

been

able

to

replace 
maturing

deposits and

advances, no

assurance can

be given

that

they

would be

able to

replace those

funds

in the

future if

the 
Corporation’s

financial condition

or

general market

conditions

were to

deteriorate. The

Corporation’s financial

flexibility would

be 
severely constrained if

the banking subsidiaries

are unable to

maintain access to

funding or if

adequate funding is

not available to 
accommodate future

financing needs

at

acceptable interest

rates. The

banking subsidiaries

also

are required

to

deposit cash

or 
qualifying

securities

to

meet

margin

requirements

on

repurchase

agreements,

deposit

agreements

and

other

collateralized 
borrowing facilities. To

the extent that

the value of

securities previously pledged as

collateral declines because of

market changes, 
the Corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin or collateral requirements and would need 
to

rely

more

heavily

on

alternative

funding

sources.

In

these

scenarios,

the

Corporation’s

financial

flexibility

and

ability

to

grow 
revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs and

profitability would be adversely affected. 
The Corporation considers balances in

excess of $250,000 to have a

higher potential liquidity risk.

Table

20 reflects the aggregate 
balance in

deposit accounts

in excess

of $250,000,

including collateralized

public funds

and deposits

outside of

the U.S.

and its 
territories.

Collateralized public funds, as presented in Table 20, represent public deposit balances from governmental

entities in the 
U.S.

and

its

territories,

including

Puerto

Rico

and

the

United

States

Virgin

Islands,

collateralized

based

on

such

jurisdictions’ 
applicable collateral requirements.

Bank Holding Companies 
The principal

sources of

funding for

the BHCs,

which are

Popular,

Inc.

(holding company

only) and

PNA, include

cash on

hand, 
investment

securities,

dividends

received from

banking

and

non-banking subsidiaries,

asset sales,

credit

facilities

available from 
affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings.

Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries 
are subject

to various

regulatory limits

and authorization

requirements imposed

by banking

regulators, including

the FED

and the 
NYDFS, that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries

to act as a source of funding to the BHCs. 
The principal uses of these funds include the repayment of debt, interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated 
deferrable interest debentures (related to trust preferred securities), the payment of dividends to common stockholders,

repurchases 
of the Corporation’s securities and capitalizing its subsidiaries.

The

outstanding

balance

of

notes

payable

at

the

BHCs

amounted

to

$594

million

at

December

31,

2024

and

$592

As

of December

the BHCs

had cash

and money

markets investments

totaling $635

million and

borrowing potential

of 
$165 million from its secured facility with BPPR.

The BHCs’

liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash

on hand, 
investments and

other sources of

liquidity that are

expected to be

sufficient to

meet all

interest payments and

dividend obligations 
for the foreseeable future.

Additionally, the Corporation’s

latest quarterly dividend was $0.70 per share

or approximately $49 million 
per quarter. 
The BHCs have in

the past borrowed in the

corporate debt market primarily to finance

their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 
debt

obligations.

These

sources

of

funding

are

more

costly

given

of

dividends to

the BHCs.

During the

In addition to cash reserves held at the FRB that totaled $ 6.4 billion at December 31, 2024, the debt securities portfolio provides an 
additional

source

of

liquidity,

which

may

be

realized

through

either

securities

sales,

collateralized

borrowings

or

repurchase 
agreements.

The

Corporation’s

debt

securities

portfolio

consists

primarily

of

liquid

U.S.

government

debt

securities,

U.S. 
government

sponsored

agency

debt

securities,

U.S.

government

sponsored

agency

mortgage-backed

securities,

and

U.S. 
government

sponsored

agency

collateralized

mortgage

obligations

that

can

be

used

to

raise

funds

in

the

repo

markets.

The 
availability

of

repurchase

agreements

would

be

subject

to

having

sufficient

unpledged

collateral

available

at

the

time

the 
transactions are

consummated, in addition

to overall

liquidity and

risk appetite

of the

various counterparties.

Refer to

Table

17 for 
details of

the Corporation’s

unpledged debt

securities and

available credit

facilities with

the FHLB

and the

discount window

of the 
Federal Reserve Bank. A substantial portion

of these debt securities could

be used to raise financing

in the U.S. money markets

or 
from secured lending sources, subject to changes in

their fair market value and customary adjustments (haircuts).

Additional liquidity may

be provided through

loan maturities, prepayments

and sales. The

loan portfolio can

also be used

to obtain 
funding in the capital

markets. Mortgage loans and some

types of consumer loans,

have secondary markets which the

Corporation 
could use. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments 
In the ordinary course

of business, the Corporation

engages in financial transactions that

are not recorded on

the balance sheet or 
may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 
provider of

financial services,

the Corporation

routinely enters

into commitments

with off-balance

sheet risk

to meet

the financial 
needs of

its customers. These

commitments may include

loan commitments and

standby letters of

credit. These commitments

are 
subject

to

the

same

credit

policies

and

approval

process

used

for

on-balance

sheet

instruments.

These

instruments

involve,

to 
varying degrees, elements

of credit and

interest rate risk

in excess of

the amount recognized

in the statement

of financial position. 

89 
Refer to

Note 23

to the

Consolidated Financial

Statements for

information on

the Corporation’s

commitments to

extent credit

and 
other non-credit commitments.

Other types

of off-balance

sheet arrangements

that the

Corporation enters

in the

ordinary course

of business

include derivatives, 
operating

leases

and

provision

of

guarantees,

indemnifications,

and

representation

and

warranties.

Refer

The Corporation monitors its cash requirements, including

its contractual obligations and debt commitments.

Financial Information of Guarantor and Issuers of Registered

Guaranteed Securities 
The principal sources of funding for Popular, Inc. Holding Company (“PIHC”) and Popular North America, Inc. (“PNA”) have included 
dividends received from their banking and non-banking subsidiaries,

asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. 
As further

described below,

in the

Risk to

Liquidity section,

various statutory

provisions limit

the dividends

an insured

depository 
institution may pay to its holding company without

regulatory approval. 
The Corporation ("PIHC") is

the parent holding company

of Popular North America (“PNA”)

and operates financial services through 
its subsidiaries. PNA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Popular, Inc., manages entities such as Equity One, Inc., and PB, including PB’s 
subsidiaries: Popular Equipment Finance, LLC,

Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A., and E-LOAN, Inc. 
PNA has issued junior subordinated debentures guaranteed by PIHC (the “obligor group”), purchased by statutory

trusts established 
by the Corporation using proceeds from trust preferred

securities (“capital securities”) and common securities

of the trusts. 
PIHC guarantees

the junior

subordinated debentures

issued by

PNA. If

PIHC fails

to make

interest payments

on the

debentures 
held by the trust,

the trust will not

distribute payments on the

capital securities. The guarantee

ranks subordinate and junior

in right 
of

payment to

all

other liabilities

of

PIHC and

equally with

all

other PIHC-issued

guarantees, allowing

direct

legal

action against 
PIHC without involving other entities. 
Funding

for

PIHC

and

PNA

includes

dividends

from

subsidiaries,

asset

sales,

and

proceeds

from

debt

and

equity

issuance. 
Statutory provisions limit the dividends an insured

depository institution can pay to its holding

company without regulatory approval. 
The summarized financial

information below shows

the combined financial

position of the

obligor group as

of December 31,

2024, 
and December 31, 2023, and their operations for the years ending on those dates. Excluded are investments and equity in earnings 
from subsidiaries and affiliates outside the obligor group. 
Intercompany balances

and transactions

within the

obligor group

have been

eliminated. Material

amounts due

from, due

to, and 
transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates are shown separately. Related party transactions

are also presented separately.

included $22.9 
million of expenses,

million was

reflected in income

tax expense

and $6.4 million

to

an

subsidiary’s

non-payment

of

on

certain

intercompany 
distributions to the Bank Holding Company (BHC) in Puerto Rico,

a foreign corporation for U.S. tax purposes. 
In addition to

the dividend income

reflected in the

Statement of Operations

table above, during

the year ended

December 
31, 2024, the

obligor group recorded a

$67.4 million of

capital distributions from

non-obligor subsidiaries which were

in an 
accumulated loss position and accordingly were

recorded as a reduction to the investments

(2023 - $64.0 million). 

91 
Risk to Liquidity 
The

Corporation’s

liquidity

may

come

under

pressure

if

it

experiences

significant

unexpected

cash

outflows

due

to

deposit 
withdrawals,

which

could

arise

from

various

factors

like

loss

of

depositor

confidence,

exogenous events,

a

downgrade

in

credit 
rating, or other events causing counterparties to avoid

exposure. The Corporation’s liquidity risk is impacted by

the following:

●

External factors such as the

economic outlook (the P.R.

market poses additional risk factors, refer to

the Geographic and 
Government Risk

section of

this MD&A

for highlights

regarding Puerto

Rico's economy

and fiscal

status),

interest rate 
volatility,

inflation,

debt

market

disruptions, and

regulatory

changes

(e.g.

if

regulatory

capital

ratios

fall

below

required 
thresholds,

the

Corporation’s

banking

subsidiaries

may

face

challenges

raising

or

retaining

brokered

deposits

and 
limitations on deposit interest rates) can impact

funding ability.

●

Management has

contingency plans

involving alternate

funding mechanisms

like pledging

asset classes

and accessing 
secured credit lines and loan facilities with the FHLB

and FRB, subject to positive tangible capital requirements. 
●

The Corporation’s ability to compete in the

deposit market relies on pricing, service, convenience, financial stability,

credit 
ratings, customer confidence, and FDIC deposit insurance

coverage. 
●

Public sector

deposits require

high-credit-quality securities

as collateral;

hence, liquidity

risks from

public sector

deposit 
outflows

are

mitigated

as

the

bank

receives

its

collateral

back.

The

Corporation

uses

fixed-rate

U.S.

Treasury

debt 
securities as collateral, which are subject to market value fluctuations based on interest rate changes. Rate increases can 
reduce collateral value, requiring additional collateral,

thus decreasing unpledged securities. 
●

The credit

ratings of

Popular’s debt

obligations are

a relevant

factor for

liquidity because

they impact

the Corporation’s 
ability to borrow in the capital markets, its cost

and access to funding sources. 
Investors should refer to

Liquidity Risk section of

“Part I, Item

1A” of this

Form 10-K for

an additional discussion of

liquidity risks to 
which the Corporation is subject. 
In addition to regulatory limits previously discussed, the

ability of a bank subsidiary to up-stream

dividends to its BHC could thus be 
impacted by

its financial

performance and

capital, including

tangible and

regulatory capital,

thus potentially

limiting the

amount of 
cash moving

up to

the BHCs

from the

banking subsidiaries. This

could, in

turn, affect

the BHCs

ability to

declare dividends

on its 
outstanding common and preferred stock, repurchase its securities or meet its

debt obligations, for example. During the year ended 
December 31,

2024, BPPR

declared cash

dividends of

$600 million

to PIHC

and could

declare a

dividend of

up to

approximately 
$318 million without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board due to its retained income, declared dividend activity and transfers 
to statutory

reserves over

the measurement

period. In

addition, pursuant

to the

FRB requirements,

PB may

not declare

or pay

a 
dividend without the prior approval of the Federal

Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. 
The Corporation’s

banking subsidiaries have

historically not used

unsecured capital market

borrowings to finance

their operations, 
and therefore are less sensitive to the level and

changes in the Corporation’s overall credit ratings. 
Credit Risk 
Geographic and Government Risk

The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk.

The Corporation’s assets and revenue composition by geographical 
area and by business segment reporting are presented

in Note 36 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
A

significant portion

of

our financial

activities and

credit

exposure is

concentrated in

the

Commonwealth of

Puerto Rico

(“Puerto 
Rico”), which has faced severe economic and fiscal

challenges in the past and may face additional

challenges in the future.

Economic Performance

92 
Puerto Rico's economy

is closely linked

to the United

States (“U.S.”) economy,

as most of

the external factors

that influence

it are 
shaped by U.S.

policies and economic performance,

including federal transfer payments, tax

policies, interest rates, inflation,

trade 
policies, and geopolitical developments.

Puerto Rico’s economy

historically followed the

economic trends of the

U.S. economy.

However, from

2007 to 2017,

Puerto Rico’s 
economy suffered

a severe

recession, with

real gross

national product

(“GNP”) contracting

approximately 15%

during this

period. 
The recession was exacerbated by the damaged caused by Hurricane María in 2017. Since 2018, Puerto Rico’s economy has been 
gradually recovering,

with a

temporary interruption

in 2020

due to

the COVID-19

pandemic, in

part aided

by the

large amount

of 
federal

disaster

relief

and

recovery

assistance

funds

received

in

connection

with

recent

natural

disasters

and

the

COVID-19 
pandemic. Future

growth depends

on multiple

factors, including

the level

of

ongoing federal

assistance and

the timetable

for

its 
deployment. Estimates

from the

Puerto Rico

Planning Board

indicated that

real GNP

grew by

2.8% during

fiscal year

2024 (July 
2023-June

2024)

and

is

projected to

grow by

1.4%

in

fiscal

year 2025

(July

2024-June 2025).

However,

the

latest Puerto

Rico 
Economic Activity Index showed a 1.1% year-over-year

decline and a 0.1% month-over-month decline in November

2024. While this 
index is not a direct measure of real GNP, it is an indicator of ongoing economic

activity. 
In

2021

and

2022,

inflation

rose

sharply

in

the

U.S.

and

Puerto

Rico

due

to

post-pandemic

demand

and

supply

chain

issues. 
Inflation

began

to

decrease

by

mid-2022

as

the

Federal

Reserve

raised

interest

rates,

largely

stabilizing

by

September

2024, 
leading to a series of rate reductions by the Federal Reserve for the first

time in four years. As of January 2025, the U.S. Consumer 
Price Index

showed a

3.0% year-over-year

increase, still

above the

Federal Reserve’s

2% target.

In Puerto

Rico, the

Consumer 
Price Index increased by 1.7% over the 12

months ending in November 2024. 
Fiscal Challenges of Puerto Rico and its Municipalities 
As

Puerto Rico’s

economy contracted

in the

2000s, public

debt

increased rapidly

due to

borrowing to

cover

deficits to

pay

debt 
service, pension benefits,

and other expenditures.

By 2016, the

government had over

$120 billion in

combined debt and

unfunded 
pension liabilities, lost access to capital markets, and

faced a fiscal crisis. 
In response, the U.S. Congress enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight,

Management, and Economic Stability Act (“PROMESA”) in June 
2016. PROMESA

established an Oversight

Board with

significant control

over Puerto

Rico’s fiscal

and economic

affairs, including 
those of

its public

corporations,

instrumentalities and

municipalities (collectively,

“PR Government

Entities”). The

Oversight Board 
will

remain

in

place

until

market

access

is

restored

and

balanced

budgets

are

achieved

for

at

least

four

consecutive

years. 
PROMESA also established

two mechanisms for

the restructuring of

the obligations of

PR Government Entities:

(a) Title

III, an

in-
court process akin

to that of

the U.S. Bankruptcy Code

and which permits

adjustment of a broad

range of obligations, and

(b) Title 
VI, a largely out-of-court process through which a

supermajority of creditors can accept modifications to

debt and bind holdouts. 
Since

2017,

Puerto

Rico

and

several

of

its

instrumentalities

have

availed

themselves

of

these

mechanisms.

The

Puerto

Rico 
government exited Title III in March 2022, and several instrumentalities, such as the Government Development Bank and the Puerto 
Rico Highways and Transportation

Authority have also completed

debt restructurings under Titles

III or VI

of PROMESA. However, 
the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is still undergoing

its debt restructuring. 
Puerto

Rico's economic

difficulties

have also

impacted its

municipalities. Historically,

the central

government provided

significant 
municipal subsidies.

However,

these, have

decreased pursuant

to fiscal

measures required

by the

Oversight Board.

This decline 
has been partly offset by federal disaster and COVID-relief funding received

by municipalities in recent years. The latest Puerto Rico 
fiscal plan proposes a

restructured grant system to enhance

municipal services and encourage accountability through

performance 
metrics. 
Municipalities

are

subject

to

PROMESA,

and

the

Oversight

Board

has

required

certain

municipalities

to

submit

fiscal

plans

and 
annual budgets

for review

and approval.

Municipalities are

also required

to seek

Oversight Board

approval to

issue, guarantee

or 
modify

their

debts

and

to

enter

into

significant

contracts.

To

date

no

municipality

has

availed

itself

of

the

debt

restructuring 
mechanisms available to them under PROMESA.

Exposure of the Corporation

The credit

quality of BPPR’s

loan portfolio

reflects, among other

things, the

general economic conditions

in Puerto

Rico and

other 
adverse conditions affecting Puerto

Rico consumers and businesses.

Deterioration in the Puerto

Rico economy has resulted

in the 

93 
past, and could

result in the future,

in higher delinquencies, greater

charge-offs and increased losses,

which could materially affect 
our financial condition and results of operations.

At

December

31,

2024,

the

Corporation’s

direct

exposure

to

PR

Government

Entities

totaled

$336

million,

all

of

which

were 
outstanding,

compared

to

$362

million,

of

which

$333

million

were

outstanding,

at

December

31,

2023.

Substantially

all

of

the 
Corporation’s direct exposure

outstanding at December 31,

2024 were obligations from

various Puerto Rico

municipalities. In most 
cases, these were “general

obligations” of a municipality,

to which the applicable

municipality has pledged its good

faith, credit and 
unlimited taxing power, or “special obligations” of

a municipality, to which

the applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax 
or

sales

tax

revenues.
At

December

31,

2024,

80%

of

the

Corporation’s

exposure

to

municipal

loans

and

securities

was 
concentrated in the municipalities of San

Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Caguas.

In July 2024, the

Corporation received scheduled 
principal payments

amounting to

$40 million

from various

obligations from

Puerto Rico

municipalities. For

additional discussion

of 
the

Corporation’s

direct

exposure to

the

Puerto

Rico

government and

its

instrumentalities and

municipalities, refer

to

Note

23

– 
Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated

Financial Statements.

In

addition, at

December 31,

2024,

the

Corporation had

$220

million

in

loans

insured

or

securities issued

by

PR

Governmental 
Entities, but for

which the principal source

of repayment is non-governmental ($238 million

at December 31, 2023). These included 
$176 million in

residential mortgage loans insured

by the Puerto

Rico Housing Finance Authority

(“HFA”), a

PR Government Entity 
(December 31, 2023

- $191

million). The Corporation

also had,

at December 31,

2024, $38 million

in bonds issued

by HFA

which 
are secured

by second mortgage

loans on

Puerto Rico

residential properties, and

for which

HFA also

provides insurance to

cover 
losses in

the event

of a

borrower default,

and upon the

satisfaction of

certain other

conditions (December 31,

2023 -

$40 million). 
HFA’s

ability to honor its

insurance will depend, among

other factors, on the

financial condition of HFA

at the time such

obligations 
become

due

and

payable.

The

Corporation

does

not

consider

the

government

guarantee

when

estimating

the

credit

losses 
associated with this portfolio.

BPPR’s

commercial loan

portfolio also

includes loans

to

private borrowers

who

are service

providers, lessors,

suppliers or

have 
other

relationships

with

the

PR

government.

These

borrowers

could

be

negatively

affected

by

a

deterioration

in

the

fiscal

and 
economic

situation

of

PR

Government

Entities.

Similarly,

BPPR’s

mortgage

and

consumer

loan

portfolios

include

loans

to 
government

employees

and

retirees,

which

could

also

be

negatively

affected

by

fiscal

measures,

such

as

employee

layoffs

or 
furloughs or reductions in pension benefits, if the

fiscal and economic situation deteriorates. 
As

of

December

31,

2024,

BPPR

had

$19.5

billion

in

deposits

from

the

Puerto

Rico

government,

its

instrumentalities,

and 
municipalities. The rate at

which public deposit balances may

decline is uncertain and

difficult to predict. The

amount and timing of 
any such

reduction is likely

to be

impacted by,

for example, the

level of federal

assistance, the speed

at which

such assistance is 
distributed and the financial condition, liquidity and cash management practices of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR

to 
maintain these customer relationships. 
United States Virgin Islands 
The

Corporation

has

operations

in

the

United

States

Virgin

Islands

(the

“USVI”)

and

has

credit

exposure

to

USVI

government 
entities. 
The USVI has

been experiencing a

number of fiscal

and economic challenges,

which could adversely

affect the

ability of its

public 
corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding

debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI

and, as such, 
there

is

currently

no

federal

legislation

permitting

the

restructuring

of

the

debts

of

the

USVI

and

its

public

corporations

and 
instrumentalities. 
To

the extent that

the fiscal condition

of the USVI

continues to deteriorate, the

U.S. Congress or the

Government of the

USVI may 
enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the

financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a

stay on creditor 
remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable

to the USVI. 
At December

31, 2024,

the Corporation

had approximately $28

million in

direct exposure to

USVI government

entities (December 
31, 2023 - $28 million).

British Virgin Islands 
The

Corporation has

operations

in

the

British Virgin

Islands

(“BVI”),

which

was

negatively

affected by

the

COVID-19

pandemic, 
particularly as

a reduction

in the

tourism activity

which accounts

for a

significant portion

of its

economy.

Although the

Corporation 
has

no

significant

exposure

to

a

single

borrower

in

the

BVI,

at

December

31,

2024,

it

has

a

loan

portfolio

amounting

to 
approximately

$196

million

comprised

of

various

retail

and

commercial

clients,

compared

to

a

loan

portfolio

of

$205

million

at 
December 31, 2023. 

94 
U.S. Government 
As further detailed in Notes

5 and 6 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the

Corporation’s investment 
securities

represented exposure

to

the

U.S.

Government in

the

form

of

U.S. Government

sponsored entities,

as

well

as

agency 
mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In

addition, $2.1 billion of residential mortgages and $87.4 million commercial

loans 
were insured

or guaranteed

by the

U.S. Government

or its

agencies at

December 31,

2024 (compared

to

$1.9 billion

and $89.2 
million, respectively, at December 31, 2023).
Non-Performing Assets 
Non-performing assets (“NPAs”)

include primarily past-due

loans that

are no

longer accruing interest,

renegotiated loans, and

real 
estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit

quality metrics, is presented in Table 24. 
The Corporation’s

credit quality

metrics remained

stable during

2024, when

compared to

the previous

year.

While non-performing 
loans

(“NPLs”),

net

charge

offs

(“NCOs”)

and

inflows

to

NPLs

remained

near

or

below

historical averages,

consumer

portfolios 
reflected

increased

delinquencies

and

NCOs.

The

mortgage

and

commercial

portfolios

continued

to

operate

with

low

levels

of 
delinquencies and NCOs. The

Corporation continues to actively monitor

changes in the macroeconomic environment

and borrower 
performance given higher

interest rates and

inflationary pressures. Management believes

that the improvements

over recent years 
in risk management practices

and the overall risk

profile of the Corporation’s

loan portfolios position Popular to

continue to operate 
successfully under the current environment. 
Total

NPAs

decreased

by

$30.0

million

when

compared

with

December

31,

2023.

Total

NPLs

decreased

by

$6.8

million

from 
December

31,

2023.

BPPR’s

NPLs

decreased

by

$36.6

million,

across

most

loan

categories,

except

consumer

NPLs

which 
reflected an

increase of

$7.4 million,

mostly driven

by the

auto portfolio.

Popular U.S.

NPLs increased

by $29.8

million, driven

by 
higher commercial and mortgage NPLs

by $12.5 million and

$18.7 million, respectively.

The mortgage NPL increase

was impacted 
by a single loan amounting to $17.1 million.

On December

31, 2024,

the ratio

of NPLs

to total

loans held-in-portfolio

was 0.95%,

compared to

1.02%, at

December 31,

2023. 
Other real estate owned loans (“OREOs”) decreased

by $23.1 million from December 31, 2023. The

decrease in OREO was driven 
by the

sale of

residential properties. On

December 31, 2024,

NPLs secured by

real estate

amounted to $200

million in the

Puerto 
Rico operations and $56 million in Popular U.S,

compared with $231 million and $24 million,

respectively, on December 31, 2023.

The Corporation’s

commercial loan

portfolio secured

by real

estate (“CRE”)

amounted to

$10.9 billion

on December

31, 2024,

of 
which

$3.2

billion

was

secured

with

owner

occupied

properties,

compared

with

$10.6

billion

and

$3.1

billion,

respectively,

on 
December 31,

2023. Office

space leasing exposure

in our

non-owner occupied CRE

portfolio is limited,

representing only 1.9%

or 
$714 million of our total loan portfolio. The

exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid- rise properties with an

average loan size of 
$2.4 million and is well diversified across tenant

type. 
CRE NPLs

amounted to

$53.7 million

at December

31, 2024,

compared with

$47.6 million

at December

31, 2023.

The CRE

NPL 
ratios for the BPPR and Popular U.S. segments were 0.64% and 0.37%, respectively,

at December 31, 2024, compared with 0.86% 
and 0.13%, respectively, at December 31, 2023. 
In addition to the NPLs included in Table 24, at December 31, 2024, there were $596 million of performing loans, mostly commercial 
loans, which in management’s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2023 
- $510 million). 
The following table presents the Corporation’s NPAs as of December 31, 2024

and 2023:

[1] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale

as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
[2] It is the Corporation’s policy to report delinquent

residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed

by the VA as accruing

loans past due 90 
days or

more as

opposed to

non-performing

since the

principal repayment

is insured.

These balances

include $65

million of

residential

mortgage 
loans insured

by FHA

or guaranteed

by the

VA

that are

no longer

accruing interest

as of

December 31,

2024 (December

31, 2023

- $106

million). 
Furthermore,

at

December

31,2024

the

Corporation

had

approximately

$31

million

in

reverse

mortgage

loans

which

are

guaranteed

by

FHA,

but 
which are currently not accruing

interest. Due to the guaranteed

nature of the loans, it

is the Corporation’s policy

to exclude these balances fr

om non-
performing assets (December 31, 2023 - $38 million). 
For

the

year

ended

December

31,

2024,

total

inflows

of

NPLs

held-in-portfolio,

excluding

consumer

loans,

increased

by

$44.6 
million, compared

to the

same period

in 2023.

Inflows of

NPLs held-in-portfolio at

the BPPR

segment decreased

by $21.7

million, 
compared to the same period in 2023, mainly driven by lower commercial and construction inflows by $28.8 million and $9.3 million, 
respectively, in part offset by higher mortgage inflows by $16.4 million. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the Popular U.S. segment 
increased by $66.3 million from the same period in 2023, mainly driven by higher commercial and mortgage inflows by $33.0 million 
and $33.3

million,

respectively.

The increase

in commercial

NPL inflows

was primarily

driven by

a single

$17.3 million

loan sold 
during the fourth quarter of 2024. Meanwhile,

the rise in mortgage NPL inflows included the

impact of a recurring $17.1 million loan. 
Tables 25 to 32 present the Corporation’s inflows to NPLs for the years ended 2024 and 2023.

Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes $0.4 billion

of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed

by the VA as of December 
31, 2024 (December 31, 2023 - $0.5 billion). Refer to Note

7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information

of guaranteed loans. 
Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) 
The ACL

represents management’s

estimate of

expected credit

losses through

the remaining

contractual life

of the

different loan 
segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL

is maintained at a sufficient

level to provide for estimated credit

losses on 
collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified

for borrowers with financial difficulties separately from the remainder

of the loan 
portfolio. The Corporation’s

management evaluates the adequacy

of the ACL

on a quarterly

basis. In this

evaluation, management 
considers current

conditions, macroeconomic

economic expectations through

a reasonable

and supportable

period, historical

loss 
experience,

portfolio composition

by

loan

type

and

risk

characteristics,

results

of

periodic credit

reviews

of

individual loans,

and 
regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 
The Corporation must rely on

estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where

the ultimate outcome is unknown, such

as 
economic developments affecting specific

customers, industries, or markets.

Other factors that can

affect management’s estimates 
are

recalibration

of

statistical

models

used

to

calculate

lifetime

expected

losses,

changes

in

underwriting

standards,

financial 
accounting standards and loan impairment measurements,

among others. Changes in the financial condition

of individual borrowers, 
in economic

conditions, and

in the

condition of

the various

markets in

which collateral

may be

sold, may

also affect

the required 
level of

the allowance

for credit

losses. Consequently,

the business

financial condition,

liquidity,

capital, and

results of

operations 
could also be affected. 

100 
On

December

31,

2024,

the

ACL

increased

by

$16.7

million

from

December

31,

2023

to

$746.0

million.

The

ACL

for

BPPR 
increased by

$30.8 million,

driven by

a combined

$23.4 million

increase in

reserves for

the consumer

and lease

portfolios and

an 
increase of $9.5

million in reserves

for commercial loans.

These increases were

mainly due to

a combination of

growth across the 
different segments

and changes

in credit

quality trends

for the

credit cards

portfolios. In

PB, the

ACL decreased

by $14.1

million, 
when compared

to December

31, 2023,

mainly due

to lower

reserves for

the commercial

portfolio resulting

from improvements

in 
credit

quality,

as

well as

lower balances

in the

consumer portfolios.

The Corporation’s

ratio of

the allowance

for credit

losses to 
loans held-in-portfolio was 2.01% on December 31, 2024, compared to 2.08% on December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for 
credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at 212.68%,

compared to 203.95% on December 31, 2023. 
Given that any one

economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the

Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate

its ACL. The 
baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability,

followed by the pessimistic scenario. The weight assigned to the 
pessimistic

scenario

decreased

during

the

first

quarter

of

2024

in

response

to

the

positive

momentum

in

the

economy

as 
expectations for

the Federal

Reserve achieving

a soft

landing have

improved. The

Corporation evaluates,

at least

on an

annual 
basis, the assumptions tied to the CECL accounting framework. These include

the reasonable and supportable period as well as the 
reversion window.

The

provision for

credit

losses

related

to

the

loans

held-in-portfolio for

the year

ended December

31,

2024,

was

$258.4 million, 
compared to $201.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2023, largely driven by higher NCOs due to credit quality changes and 
commercial

loan

growth.

NCOs for the year ended December 31, 2024,

amounted to $241.8 million, increasing by $95.4 million when compared to the

same 
period in 2023.

The BPPR segment

increased by $95.4

million mainly driven

by higher consumer

and commercial NCOs

by $68.6 

103 
million and $25.4 million, respectively. The consumer NCOs continue to gradually

increase mainly due to credit quality changes. The 
PB segment NCOs remained flat year-over-year.

Loan Modifications 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024,

modified loans to borrowers with financial difficulty

amounted to $455 million, of 
which $430 million were in accruing status. The

BPPR segment’s modifications to borrowers with financial

difficulty amounted to 
$441 million, mainly comprised of commercial and mortgage

loans of $358 million and $66 million, respectively. A total of $44

million 
of the mortgage modifications were related to government

guaranteed loans. The Popular U.S. segment’s modifications

to 
borrowers with financial difficulty amounted to $14 million,

of which $12 million were commercial loans.

Enterprise Risk Management 
The Corporation’s

Board of

Directors has

established a

Risk Management

Committee (“RMC”)

to, among

other things,

assist the 
Board in its (i) oversight of the Corporation’s overall risk framework and (ii)

to monitor, review, and approve policies to measure, limit 
and manage the Corporation’s risks.

The

Corporation

has

established

a

three

lines

of

defense

framework:

(a)

business

line

management constitutes

the

first

line

of 
defense by identifying

and managing the

risks associated with

business activities, (b) components

of the Risk

Management Group 
and

the

Corporate

Security

Group,

among

others,

act

as

the

second

line

of

defense

by,

among

other

things,

measuring

and 
reporting on the Corporation’s risk activities, and (c) the Corporate Auditing Division
,

as the third line of defense, reporting directly to 
the Audit Committee of the Board, by independently providing

assurance regarding the effectiveness of the risk

framework.

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the “ERM Committee”)

is a management committee whose purpose is to oversee and 
monitor Market, Interest, Liquidity,

Regulatory and Financial Compliance, BSA/AML & Sanctions, Regulatory,

Strategic, Operational 
(including

Fraud

and

Third

Party

Risk,

among

others),

Information

Technology

and

Cyber

Security,

Legal,

Credit,

Climate

and 
Reputational risks, as

defined in the

Risk Appetite Statement

(“RAS”) of the

Risk Management Policy

and within the

Corporation’s 
Enterprise Risk

Management (“ERM”)

framework. The

ERM

Committee and

the Enterprise

Risk Management

Department in

the 
Financial and Operational

Risk Management Division

(the “FORM Division”),

in coordination with

the Chief Risk

Officer,

create the 
framework to identify and manage multiple and cross-enterprise

risks, and to articulate the RAS and supporting

metrics. 
The

Enterprise

Risk

Management

Department

has

established

a

process

to

ensure

that

an

appropriate

standard

readiness 
assessment is performed before we launch a new product or service. Similar procedures are performed by the Treasury Division for 
transactions involving

the purchase

and sale

of assets,

and by

the Mergers

and Acquisitions

Division for

acquisition transactions. 
The Enterprise Risk Management Department has a Corporate Issues

Management Policy to promote on time remediation of issues 
and increase the

governance and transparency around

the number and

the severity of

issues identified for each

business unit and 
corporate

function

by

all

sources.

The

Enterprise

Risk

Management

Department

also

has

a

Corporate

Regulatory

Change 
Management Program

to

oversee,

on

a

risk

basis,

the

implementation of

laws

and

regulations by

the

appropriate

business and 
support areas. 
The Asset/Liability

Committee (“ALCO”),

composed of

senior management

representatives from

the business

lines and

corporate 
functions, and the Corporate Finance Group, are responsible for planning and executing the

Corporation’s market, interest rate risk, 
funding

activities

and

strategy,

as

well

as

for

implementing

approved

policies

and

procedures.

The

ALCO

also

reviews

the 
Corporation’s

capital

policy

and

the

attainment

of

the

capital

management

objectives.

In

addition,

the

Financial

Risk,

Corporate 
Insurance & Advisory Department independently measures,

monitors and reports compliance with

liquidity and market risk policies, 
and oversees controls surrounding interest risk measurements. 
The Corporate Compliance

Committee, comprised of

senior management team

members and representatives

from the Regulatory 
and Financial

Compliance Division

and the

Financial Crimes

Compliance Division,

among others,

are responsible

for overseeing 
and

assessing

the

adequacy

of

the

risk

management

processes

that

support

Popular’s

compliance

program

for

identifying, 
assessing,

measuring,

monitoring,

testing,

mitigating,

and

reporting

compliance

risks.

They

also

supervise

Popular’s

reporting 
obligations

under

the

compliance

program

to

assess

the

adequacy,

consistency

and

timeliness

of

the

reporting

of

compliance-
related risks across the Corporation.

104 
The Regulatory Affairs

team is responsible

for maintaining an

open dialog with

the banking regulatory

agencies to have

regulatory 
risks properly identified, measured, monitored, as well as communicated to

the appropriate regulatory agency as necessary to keep 
them apprised of material matters within the purview

of these agencies.
The

Credit

Strategy

Committee,

composed

of

senior

level

management

representatives

from

the

business

lines

and

corporate 
functions, and the Corporate Credit Risk Management Division,

are responsible for monitoring credit risk management

activities both 
at

the corporate

level

and

across all

Popular subsidiaries

providing for

the

development and

consistent

application of

credit

risk 
policies, processes

and procedures

that measure,

limit and

manage credit

risks, while

seeking to

maintain the

effectiveness and 
efficiency of the operating and businesses processes.

The Corporation’s Operational Risk Committee (“ORCO”) composed of senior

level management representatives from the business 
lines

and

corporate

functions,

provide

executive

oversight

of

the

operational

risk

management

activities

of

Popular

and

its 
subsidiaries providing

for the

development and

consistent application

of operational

risk policies,

processes, and

procedures that 
measure,

limit,

and

manage

operational

risks

while

maintaining

the

effectiveness

and

efficiency

of

the

operating

and

business 
processes.

The

FORM

Division,

within

the

Risk

Management

Group,

serves

as

ORCO’s

operating

arm

and

is

responsible

for 
establishing baseline processes to measure, monitor, limit and manage

operational risk. 
The Corporate Security Group (“CSG”), under the direction of the

Chief Security Officer, leads

all efforts pertaining to cybersecurity, 
enterprise fraud and data

privacy, including

developing strategies and oversight processes with

policies and programs that mitigate 
compliance, operational,

strategic, financial

and reputational

risks associated

with the

Corporation’s and

our customers’

data and 
assets.

The Information Technology

and Cyber Risk

Committee, composed of senior

management representatives from the

business lines 
and

corporate

functions,

the

Information

Technology

Division

and

the

CSG,

are

responsible

for

the

oversight

and

monitoring

of 
information

technology

and

cybersecurity

risks,

mitigation

strategies,

actions

and

controls,

key

risk

metrics,

and

information 
technology and cyber incidents that may result in operational, compliance and reputational risks.
The Chief Security Officer also co-
chairs the Information Technology & Cyber Security Risk Committee along with the Chief Information

& Digital Strategy Officer. 
The Corporate Legal Division, in this context, has the responsibility

of assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting with respect to 
legal risks, including those related to litigation, investigations

and other material legal matters.

The

Corporation has

also

established

a

Corporate Sustainability

Committee

whose

purpose

and

responsibility is

to

oversee the 
Corporation’s sustainability efforts and support the development and consistent application of policies, strategies and guidelines that 
measure and

manage sustainability

matters and

risks. The

Corporate Sustainability

Committee also

assesses environmental

and 
social considerations

with respect

to certain

commercial credit

applications, in

accordance with

the applicable

Commercial Credit 
Policy and Commercial Credit Manuals of BPPR

and PB. 
The processes

of strategic

risk planning

and the

evaluation of

reputational risk

are on-going

processes through

which continuous 
data gathering and analysis are performed. In order to have strategic risks properly identified and monitored, the Corporate Strategy 
and Transformation Division, which

reports to the Corporation’s

Chief Operations Officer,

performs periodic assessments regarding 
corporate strategic priority initiatives, such as the Corporation’s transformation initiative and other emerging issues. The Acquisitions 
and Corporate Investments Division continuously assesses potential

strategic transactions. The Corporate Communications Division 
is responsible for the monitoring, management and

implementation of action plans with respect to reputational

risk issues. 
Popular’s capital planning process integrates the Corporation’s risk profile

as well as its strategic focus, operating

environment, and 
other factors

that could

materially affect

capital adequacy

in hypothetical

highly-stressed business

scenarios. Capital

ratio targets 
and triggers take into consideration the different risks evaluated

under Popular’s risk management framework. 
In

addition to

establishing a

formal process

to manage

risk, our

corporate culture

is also

critical to

an effective

risk management 
function.

Through our Code

of Ethics, the

Corporation provides a framework

for all our

employees to conduct themselves

with the 
highest integrity.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial

Reporting 
The management of

Popular, Inc.

(the “Corporation”) is responsible

for establishing and

maintaining adequate internal control

over 
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d -

15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for our assessment 
of internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation’s internal

control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in

accordance

with

accounting

principles

generally

accepted

in

the

United

States

of

America,

and

includes

controls

over

the 
preparation of

financial statements

in accordance

with the

instructions to

the Consolidated

Financial Statements

for Bank

Holding 
Companies (Form FR Y-9C)

to comply with the reporting requirements of Section 112

of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Improvement Act (FDICIA). The Corporation’s internal control

over financial reporting includes those policies

and procedures that: 
(i)

pertain

to

the

maintenance

of

records

that,

in

reasonable

detail,

accurately

and

fairly

reflect

the

transactions

and 
dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; 
(ii)

provide

reasonable

assurance

that

transactions

are

recorded

as

necessary

to

permit

preparation

of

financial 
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors 
of the Corporation; and 
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding

prevention or timely detection of

unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition 
of the Corporation’s assets that could have a material effect

on the financial statements. 
Because

of

its

inherent

limitations,

internal

control

over

financial

reporting

may

not

prevent

or

detect

misstatements.

Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance

with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The management of Popular,

Inc. has assessed the

effectiveness of the Corporation’s

internal control over financial reporting

as of 
December

31,

2024.

In

making

this

assessment,

management

used

the

criteria

set

forth

in

the

Internal

Control-Integrated 
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2024 based on the

criteria referred to above. 
The Corporation’s

independent registered

public accounting

firm, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
,

has audited

the effectiveness

of 
the Corporation’s

internal control

over financial

reporting as

of December

31, 2024,

as stated

in their

report dated

March 3,

2025 
which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Popular, Inc. 
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal

Control over Financial Reporting

We

have

audited

the

accompanying

consolidated

statements

of

financial

condition

of

Popular,

Inc.

and

its 
subsidiaries

(the

“Corporation”)

as

of

December

31,

2024

and

2023,

and

the

related

consolidated

statements

of 
operations, comprehensive income (loss),

changes in stockholders’ equity

and cash flows for

each of the three

years 
in

the

period

ended

December

31,

2024,

including

the

related

notes

(collectively

referred

to

as

the

“consolidated 
financial

statements”).

We

also

have

audited

the

Corporation's

internal

control

over

financial

reporting

as

of 
December

31, 2024,

based on

criteria

established in

Internal Control

- Integrated

Framework (2013)

issued

by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
In

our

opinion,

the

consolidated

financial

statements

referred

to

above

present

fairly,

in

all

material

respects,

the 
financial position of the Corporation as of

December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the

results of its operations and its cash 
flows

for

each

of

the

three

years

in

the

period

ended

December

31,

2024

in

conformity with

accounting

principles 
generally accepted

in the

United States

of America.

Also in

our opinion,

the Corporation

maintained,

in all

material 
respects, effective

internal control over

financial reporting as

of December 31,

2024, based on

criteria established

in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
Basis for Opinions

The

Corporation's management

is responsible

for these

consolidated

financial statements,

for maintaining

effective 
internal control

over financial

reporting, and

for its

assessment of

the effectiveness

of internal

control over

financial 
reporting,

included

in

the

accompanying

Report

of

Management

on

Internal

Control

over

Financial

Reporting.

Our 
responsibility is

to express opinions

on the

Corporation’s consolidated

financial statements and

on the

Corporation’s 
internal

control

over

financial

reporting

based

on

our

audits.

We

are

a

public

accounting

firm

registered

with

the 
Public

Company

Accounting

Oversight

Board

(United

States)

(PCAOB)

and

are

required

to

be

independent

with 
respect

to

the

Corporation

in

accordance

with

the

U.S.

federal

securities

laws

and

the

applicable

rules

and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits

in accordance with the standards

of the PCAOB. Those standards

require that we plan and 
perform

the audits

to obtain

reasonable assurance

about

whether the

consolidated financial

statements are

free of 
material

misstatement,

whether due

to error

or

fraud, and

whether

effective

internal control

over financial

reporting 
was maintained in all material respects. 
Our

audits

of

the

consolidated

financial

statements

included

performing

procedures

to

assess

the

risks of

material 
misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due

to error or fraud,

and performing procedures that 
respond to

those risks.

Such procedures

included examining,

on a

test basis,

evidence regarding

the amounts

and 
disclosures

in

the

consolidated

financial

statements.

Our

audits

also

included

evaluating

the

accounting

principles 
used

and

significant

estimates

made

by

management,

as

well

as

evaluating

the

overall

presentation

of

the 
consolidated

financial

statements.

Our

audit

of

internal

control

over

financial

reporting

included

obtaining

an 
understanding

of

internal

control

over

financial

reporting,

assessing

the

risk

that

a

material

weakness

exists,

and 
testing

and

evaluating

the

design

and

operating

effectiveness

of

internal

control

based

on

the

assessed

risk.

Our 
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in

the circumstances. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

110 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A 
company’s

internal

control

over

financial

reporting

is

a

process

designed

to

provide

reasonable

assurance 
regarding

the

reliability

of

financial

reporting

and

the

preparation

of

financial

statements

for

external

purposes

in 
accordance

with

generally

accepted

accounting

principles.

Management's

assessment

and

our

audit

of

Popular, 
Inc.'s

internal

control

over

financial

reporting

also

included

controls

over

the

preparation

of

financial

statements

in 
accordance with the instructions

to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for Bank Holding Companies

(Form FR Y-
9C)

to

comply

with

the

reporting

requirements

of

Section

112

of

the

Federal

Deposit

Insurance

Corporation 
Improvement

Act

(FDICIA).

A

company’s

internal

control

over

financial

reporting

includes

those

policies

and 
procedures

that (i)

pertain to

the maintenance

of records

that, in

reasonable detail,

accurately

and fairly

reflect the 
transactions and

dispositions of

the assets

of the

company; (ii)

provide reasonable

assurance that

transactions are 
recorded

as

necessary

to

permit

preparation

of

financial

statements

in

accordance

with

generally

accepted 
accounting

principles, and

that receipts

and expenditures

of the

company are

being made

only

in accordance

with 
authorizations

of

management

and

directors

of

the

company;

and

(iii)

provide

reasonable

assurance

regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of

its inherent

limitations, internal

control over

financial reporting

may not

prevent or

detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of

any evaluation of effectiveness

to future periods are

subject to the risk

that controls may become 
inadequate because

of changes

in conditions,

or that

the degree

of compliance

with the

policies or

procedures may 
deteriorate. 
Critical Audit Matters

The

critical

audit

matter

communicated

below

is

a

matter

arising

from

the

current

period

audit

of

the

consolidated 
financial

statements

that

was

communicated

or

required

to

be

communicated

to

the

audit

committee

and

that

(i) 
relates

to

accounts

or

disclosures

that

are

material

to

the

consolidated

financial

statements

and

(ii)

involved

our 
especially challenging,

subjective, or

complex judgments.

The communication

of critical

audit matters

does not

alter 
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and

we are not, by communicating 
the

critical

audit

matter

below,

providing

a

separate

opinion

on

the

critical

audit

matter

or

on

the

accounts

or 
disclosures to which it relates. 
Allowance

for

Credit

Losses

on

Loans

Held-in-Portfolio

-

Quantitative

Models,

and

Qualitative

Adjustments

to

the 
Puerto Rico Commercial Portfolios 
As described in

Notes 2 and

8 to the

consolidated financial statements,

the Corporation follows

the current expected 
credit

loss

(“CECL”)

model,

to

establish

and

evaluate

the

adequacy

of

the

allowance

for

credit

losses

(“ACL”)

to 
provide for expected

losses in the loan

portfolio. As of December

31, 2024, the allowance

for credit losses

was $746 
million

on

total

loans

of

$37

billion.

This

CECL

model

establishes

a

forward-looking

methodology

that

reflects

the 
expected credit losses over the lives of financial assets. The quantitative modeling framework includes competing risk 
models

to

generate

lifetime

defaults

and

prepayments,

and

other

loan

level

modeling

techniques

to

estimate

loss 
severity.

As

part

of

this

methodology,

management

evaluates

various

macroeconomic

scenarios

and

may

apply 
probability

weights

to

the

outcome

of

the

selected

scenarios.

The

ACL

also

includes

a

qualitative

framework

that 
addresses losses

that are

expected but

not captured

within the

quantitative modeling

framework. In

order to

identify 
potential

losses

that are

not captured

through the

models, management

evaluated model

limitations as

well as

the 
different

risks covered

by the

variables used

in each

quantitative model.

To

complement the

analysis, management 
also evaluated

sectors that

have low

levels of

historical defaults,

but current

conditions show

the potential

for future 
losses. 
The

119 
Note 1 – Nature of Operations
Nature of Operations 

Popular,

Inc. (the

“Corporation” or

“Popular”) is

a diversified,

publicly-owned financial

holding company

subject to

the supervision 
and

regulation

of

the

Board

of

Governors

of

the

Federal

Reserve

System.

The

Corporation

has

operations

in

Puerto

Rico,

the 
mainland United

States (“U.S.”)

and the

U.S. and

British Virgin

Islands. In

Puerto Rico,

the Corporation

provides retail,

mortgage, 
and

commercial

banking

services,

through

its

principal

banking

subsidiary,

Banco

Popular

de

Puerto

Rico

(“BPPR”),

as

well

as 
investment

banking,

broker-dealer,

auto

and

equipment

leasing

and

financing,

and

insurance

services

through

specialized 
subsidiaries.

In

the

mainland

U.S.,

the

Corporation

provides

retail,

mortgage

and

commercial

banking

services

through

its

New 
York-chartered

banking subsidiary,

Popular Bank

(“PB” or

“Popular U.S.”),

which has

branches located

in New

York,

New Jersey 
and Florida, investment and insurance services and equipment

leasing and financing services through specialized

subsidiaries. 

Tax impact on Intercompany Distributions 
The net income for

the year ended December

31, 2024 included $
22.9

million of expenses, of

which $ 
16.5

million was reflected in 
income tax

expense and $
6.4

million was

reflected in

other operating expenses,

related to an

out-of-period adjustment associated 
with the

Corporation’s U.S. subsidiary’s

non-payment of taxes

on certain intercompany

distributions to the

Bank Holding Company 
(BHC) in

Puerto Rico,

a foreign

corporation for

U.S. tax

purposes. The

adjustment corrected

errors for

income tax

expense that 
should have

been recognized

of $
5.5

million and

$
5.4

million in

the years

2023 and

2022, respectively,

and an

aggregate of

$
5.6
million, in the years prior to 2022. The $
6.4

million recognized as other operating expense corresponded to interest due up to March 
31, 2024 on the related late payment of the withholding tax, of

which approximately $
3.0

million corresponded to years prior to 2022. 
As a result of this adjustment, the deferred

tax asset related to NOL of the BHC

and its related valuation allowance was reduced by 
$
52.2

million.

The

Corporation

evaluated

the

impact

of

the

out-of-period

adjustment

and

concluded

it

was

not

material

to

any 
previously issued interim or annual consolidated financial

statements.

120 
Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting

policies
The

accounting

and

financial

reporting

policies

of

Popular,

Inc.

and

its

subsidiaries

(the

“Corporation”) conform

with

accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States

of America and with prevailing practices within

the financial services industry.

The following is a description of the most significant

of these policies: 
Principles of consolidation 
The

consolidated

financial

statements

include

the

accounts

of

Popular,

Inc.

and

its

subsidiaries.

Intercompany

accounts

and 
transactions have been

eliminated in consolidation. In

accordance with the

consolidation guidance for variable

interest entities, the 
Corporation

would

also

consolidate

any

variable

interest

entities

(“VIEs”)

for

which

it

has

a

controlling

financial

interest;

and 
therefore, it is the primary beneficiary. Assets

held in a fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Corporation and, accordingly,

are not 
included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial

Condition. 
Unconsolidated investments, in

which there is

at least

20% ownership and

/ or

the Corporation exercises

significant influence, are 
generally

accounted

for

by

the

equity

method

with

earnings

recorded

in

other

operating

income.

Limited

partnerships

are

also 
accounted for by the equity method unless the investor’s

interest is so “minor” that the limited partner may have

virtually no influence 
over

partnership

operating

and

financial

policies.

These

investments

are

included

in

other

assets

and

the

Corporation’s 
proportionate share of income or loss is included

in other operating income.

Statutory business trusts that are wholly-owned by the Corporation and are

issuers of trust preferred securities are not consolidated 
in the Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. Under this method, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and 
any noncontrolling

interest in

the acquiree

at the

acquisition date

are measured

at their

fair values

as of

the acquisition

date. The 
acquisition

date

is

the

date

the

acquirer

obtains

control.

Transaction

costs

are

expensed

as

incurred.

Contingent

consideration 
classified as an asset

or a liability is remeasured to

fair value at each reporting

date until the contingency is

resolved. The changes 
in fair

value of

the contingent

consideration are

recognized in

earnings unless

the arrangement

is a

hedging instrument

for which 
changes are initially recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The Corporation did not engage

in any business combination 
activities during the years ended December 31,

2024 and 2023.

Use of estimates in the preparation of financial

statements 
The preparation of financial

statements in conformity with

accounting principles generally accepted in

the United States

of America 
requires management to make

estimates and assumptions that

affect the reported

amounts of assets and

liabilities and contingent 
assets

and

liabilities

at

the

date

of

the

financial

statements,

and

the

reported

amounts

of

revenues

and

expenses

during

the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair value measurements 
The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial

instruments based on the fair value framework established

in the guidance 
for Fair Value

Measurements in Accounting

Standards Codification (“ASC”)

Subtopic 820-10, which

requires an entity

to maximize 
the use

of observable inputs

and minimize the

use of

unobservable inputs when

measuring fair value.

Fair value is

defined as the 
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability

(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous 
market

for

the

asset

or

liability

in

an

orderly

transaction

between

market

participants

on

the

measurement

date.

The

standard 
describes three

levels of

inputs that

may be

used to

measure fair

value which

are (1)

quoted market

prices for

identical assets

or 
liabilities in active markets, (2) observable market-based

inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated

by market data, and (3) 
unobservable

inputs

that

are

not

corroborated

by

market

data.

The

fair

value

hierarchy

ranks

the

quality

and

reliability

of

the 
information used to determine fair values.

The

guidance

in

ASC

Subtopic

820-10

also

addresses

measuring

fair

value

in

situations

where

markets

are

inactive

and 
transactions are

not orderly.

Transactions

or quoted

prices for

assets and

liabilities may

not be

determinative of

fair value

when 
transactions are not

orderly, and

thus, may require

adjustments to estimate fair

value. Price quotes

based on transactions

that are 
not orderly should be given

little, if any,

weight in measuring fair value. Price

quotes based on transactions that are

orderly shall be 
considered

in

determining

fair

value,

and

the

weight

given

is

based

on

facts

and

circumstances.

If

sufficient

information

is

not 
available to

determine if

price quotes

are based

on orderly

transactions, less

weight should

be given to

the price

quote relative

to 
other transactions that are known to be orderly.

121 
Investment securities 
Investment securities are classified in four categories and

accounted for as follows: 
●

Debt securities that

the Corporation has

the intent and

ability to hold

to maturity are

classified as debt

securities held-to-
maturity and reported

at amortized cost. An

ACL is established

for the expected credit

losses over the remaining

term of 
debt securities held-to-maturity. The Corporation has established a methodology to estimate credit losses which

considers 
qualitative factors,

including internal credit

ratings and

the underlying source

of repayment

in determining

the amount

of 
expected

credit

losses.

Debt

securities

held-to-maturity

are

written-off

through

the

ACL

when

a

portion

or

the

entire 
amount is deemed uncollectible, based on the information considered to develop expected credit losses through the life of 
the

asset.

The

ACL

is

estimated

by

leveraging

the

expected

loss

framework

for

mortgages

in

the

case

of

securities 
collateralized by

2
nd

lien loans

and the

commercial C&I

models for

municipal bonds.

As part

of this

framework, internal 
factors are stressed,

as a qualitative

adjustment, to reflect current

conditions that are

not necessarily captured within

the 
historical

loss

experience.

The

modeling

framework

includes

a

2-year

reasonable

and

supportable

period

gradually 
reverting, over a

3-years horizon, to

historical information at

the model input

level. The Corporation’s

portfolio of held-to-
maturity

securities

includes

U.S. Treasury

notes

and

obligations from

the

U.S.

Government. These

securities

have

an 
explicit or implicit guarantee from the U.S. government, are highly rated by major

rating agencies, and have a long history 
of no

credit losses.

Accordingly,

the Corporation

applies a

zero-credit loss

assumption and

no ACL

for these

securities 
has been established. The

Corporation may not sell

or transfer held-to-maturity securities without

calling into question its 
intent

to

hold

other

debt

securities

to

maturity,

unless

a

nonrecurring

or

unusual

event

that

could

not

have

been 
reasonably anticipated has occurred. 
●

Debt securities

classified as

trading securities

are reported

at fair

value, with

unrealized and

realized gains

and losses 
included in non-interest income.
●

Debt

securities

classified

as

available-for-sale

are

reported

at

fair

value.

Declines

in

fair

value

below

the

securities’ 
amortized cost which are

not related to estimated credit losses

are recorded through other comprehensive income

(loss), 
net of

taxes. If

the Corporation intends

to sell

or believes

it is

more likely than

not that it

will be

required to sell

the debt 
security,

it is

written down

to

fair value

through earnings.

Credit losses

relating to

available-for-sale debt

securities are 
recorded through an

ACL, which are

limited to the

difference between the

amortized cost and the

fair value of

the asset. 
The ACL is established for the expected credit losses over the remaining term of debt security. The Corporation’s portfolio 
of

available-for-sale securities

is comprised

mainly

of

U.S. Treasury

notes

and

obligations from

the

U.S.

Government. 
These

securities

have

an

explicit

or

implicit

guarantee

from

the

U.S.

government,

are

highly

rated

by

major

rating 
agencies, and have a

long history of no

credit losses. Accordingly,

the Corporation applies a

zero-credit loss assumption 
and no

ACL for

these securities

has been

established. The Corporation

monitors its securities

portfolio composition and 
credit performance on a

quarterly basis to determine if

any allowance is considered necessary.

Debt securities available-
for-sale are written-off when

a portion or

the entire amount is

deemed uncollectible, based on the

information considered 
to

develop expected

credit losses

through the

life of

the asset.

The specific

identification method

is used

to

determine 
realized

gains

and

losses

on

debt

securities

available-for-sale,

which

are

included

in

net

(loss)

gain

on

sale

of

debt 
securities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
●

Equity securities that have readily available fair values are reported at fair value. Equity securities that do not have readily 
available fair

values are

measured at

cost, less

any impairment,

plus or

minus changes

resulting from

observable price 
changes in

orderly transactions

for the

identical or

a similar

investment of

the same

issuer.

Stock that

is owned

by the 
Corporation

to

comply

with

regulatory

requirements,

such

as

Federal

Reserve

Bank

and

Federal

Home

Loan

Bank 
(“FHLB”) stock, is included in this category, and their realizable value equals their cost. Unrealized and realized gains and 
losses and any impairment on equity securities are included in net gain (loss), including impairment on equity securities in 
the Consolidated Statements

of Operations. Dividend income

from investments in

equity securities is included

in interest 
income.
The

amortization

of

premiums is

deducted

and

the

accretion of

discounts is

added to

net

interest income

based on

the

interest 
method

over the

outstanding period

of

the

related

securities.

Purchases and

sales

of

securities

are

recognized

on

a

trade

date 
basis.
Derivative financial instruments 
All derivatives are recognized on the Statements of Financial Condition at

fair value. The Corporation’s policy is not to

offset the fair 
value

amounts

recognized

for

multiple

derivative

instruments

executed

with

the

same

counterparty

under

a

master

netting 

122 
arrangement nor to offset the fair value amounts recognized for the

right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation

to 
return cash collateral (a payable) arising from the

same master netting arrangement as the derivative

instruments. 
For

a

cash

flow

hedge,

changes

in

the

fair

value

of

the

derivative

instrument

are

recorded

net

of

taxes

in

accumulated

other 
comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified

to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged

transaction impacts 
earnings. For free-standing derivative instruments,

changes in fair values are reported in current

period earnings. 
Prior

to

entering

a

hedge

transaction,

the

Corporation

formally

documents

the

relationship

between

hedging

instruments

and 
hedged

items,

as

well

as

the

risk

management objective

and

strategy for

undertaking various

hedge

transactions.

This

process 
includes

linking all

derivative instruments

to

specific assets

and

liabilities on

the Statements

of

Financial Condition

or to

specific 
forecasted transactions

or firm

commitments along

with a

formal assessment,

at both

inception of

the hedge

and on

an ongoing 
basis,

as

to

the

effectiveness

of the

derivative instrument

in

offsetting

changes

in

fair

values

or

cash

flows

of

the

hedged

item. 
Hedge accounting

is discontinued

when the

derivative instrument

is not

highly effective

as a

hedge, a

derivative expires,

is sold, 
terminated, when it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will

occur or when it is determined that it is

no longer appropriate. When 
hedge accounting is discontinued the derivative continues

to be carried at fair value with changes in fair

value included in earnings.

The Corporation

utilizes forward

contracts to

hedge the

sale

of mortgage-backed

securities with

duration terms

over one

month. 
Interest rate forwards are contracts for the delayed delivery of securities,

which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date 
at

a

specified

price

or

yield.

Based

on

the

election

to

apply

fair

value

accounting

for

its

mortgage

loans

held

for

sale,

hedge 
accounting

is

not

used

for

these

forward

contracts

and

changes

in

the

fair

value

of

the

loans

are

expected

to

be

offset

by

the 
changes in the fair value of the forward

contract, both of which are recorded through net

income (loss). 
For non-exchange

traded contracts,

fair value

is based

on dealer

quotes, pricing

models, discounted

cash flow

methodologies or 
similar techniques for which the determination of

fair value may require significant management judgment

or estimation.

The fair value of derivative instruments considers

the risk of non-performance by the counterparty

or the Corporation, as applicable.

The Corporation obtains or pledges collateral in

connection with its derivative activities when applicable

under the agreement.
Loans

Loans

are

classified

as

loans

held-in-portfolio when

management has

the

intent

and

ability

to

hold

the

loan

for

the

foreseeable 
future, or

until maturity

or payoff.

The foreseeable

future is

a management

judgment which

is determined

based upon

the type

of 
loan,

business strategies,

current market

conditions, balance

sheet

management and

liquidity needs.

Management’s view

of

the 
foreseeable future may change based on changes in these conditions. When a decision is made to sell or securitize a loan that

was 
not originated or

initially acquired with the

intent to sell

or securitize, the loan

is reclassified from held-in-portfolio

into held-for-sale. 
Due to changing market conditions or other strategic

initiatives, management’s intent with respect to the disposition of

the loan may 
change,

and

accordingly,

loans

previously classified

as

held-for-sale may

be

reclassified into

held-in-portfolio. Loans

transferred 
between loans held-for-sale and held-in-portfolio

classifications are recorded at the lower of cost or

fair value at the date of transfer.

Purchased

loans

with

no

evidence

of

credit

deterioration

since

origination

are

recorded

at

fair

value

upon

acquisition.

Credit 
discounts are included in the determination of fair

value.

Loans held-in-portfolio

are reported

at their

outstanding principal

balances net

of any

unearned income,

charge-offs, unamortized 
deferred fees and

costs on originated

loans, and premiums

or discounts on

purchased loans. Fees

collected and costs

incurred in 
the

origination of

new

loans are

deferred and

amortized using

the interest

method or

a method

which approximates

the interest 
method over the term of the loan as an adjustment

to interest yield. 
Loans held-for-sale,

except for

mortgage loans

originated as

held-for-sale, are

stated at

the lower

of cost

or fair

value, cost

being 
determined based

on the

outstanding loan

balance less

unearned income,

and fair

value determined,

generally in

the aggregate. 
Fair value is measured based on current market prices for similar loans, outstanding investor commitments, prices

of recent sales or 
discounted cash

flow analyses

which utilize

inputs and

assumptions which

are believed

to be

consistent with

market participants’ 
views. The

cost basis

also includes

consideration of

deferred origination

fees and

costs, which

are recognized

in earnings

at the 
time of sale.

Upon reclassification to held-for-sale,

credit related fair

value adjustments are recorded

as a reduction

in the ACL.

To 
the extent that the loan's reduction in value

has not already been provided for in the ACL,

an additional provision for credit losses is 
recorded. Subsequent to reclassification to held-for-sale, the amount, by

which cost exceeds fair value, if any,

is accounted for as a 
valuation allowance

with changes

therein included

in the

determination of

net income

for the

period in

which the

change occurs. 
Newly originated mortgage loans held-for-sale are reported

at fair value, with changes recorded through

earnings. 

123 
The past due status of a loan is determined in accordance with its

contractual repayment terms. Furthermore, loans are reported as 
past due when either interest or principal remains

unpaid for 30 days or more in accordance

with its contractual repayment terms. 
Non-accrual loans are those loans on which the

accrual of interest is discontinued. When a loan is

placed on non-accrual status, all 
previously

accrued

and

unpaid interest

is

charged against

interest

income

and

the

loan

is

accounted for

either

on

a cash-basis 
method or

on the

cost-recovery method.

Loans designated

as non-accruing

are returned

to accrual

status when

the Corporation 
expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal

and interest.

Recognition of interest income on commercial and construction loans is discontinued when the loans are 90 days or more in arrears 
on payments of principal or interest or when other factors indicate that the collection of principal and interest is

doubtful. The portion 
of

a

secured

loan

deemed

uncollectible

is

charged-off

no

later

than

365

days

past

due.

However,

in

the

case

of

a

collateral 
dependent

loan,

the

excess

of

the

recorded

investment

over

the

fair

value

of

the

collateral

(portion

deemed

uncollectible)

is 
generally

promptly charged-off,

but

in

any

event,

not

later

than

the

quarter

following

the

quarter

in

which

such

excess was

first 
recognized.

Commercial

unsecured

loans

are

charged-off

no

later

than

180

days

past

due.

Recognition

of

interest

income

on 
mortgage

loans

is

generally

discontinued

when

loans

are

90

days

or

more

in

arrears

on

payments

of

principal

or

interest.

The 
portion of a

mortgage loan deemed

uncollectible is charged-off

when the loan

is 180 days

past due. The

Corporation discontinues 
the recognition

of interest

on residential

mortgage loans

insured by

the Federal

Housing Administration

(“FHA”) or

guaranteed by 
the U.S.

Department of Veterans

Affairs (“VA”)

when 15-months

delinquent as

to principal

or interest.

The principal

repayment on 
these loans is insured. Recognition of interest income on closed-end consumer loans and home equity lines of credit is discontinued 
when the

loans are

90 days

or more

in arrears

on payments

of principal

or interest.

Income is

generally recognized

on open-end 
consumer loans,

except for

home equity

lines

of

credit,

until

the

loans are

charged-off.

Recognition of

interest

income

for

lease 
financing is ceased when

loans are 90 days

or more in arrears.

Closed-end consumer loans and leases

are charged-off when they 
are 120

days in

arrears. Open-end

(revolving credit)

consumer loans

are charged-off

when 180

days in

arrears. Commercial

and 
consumer overdrafts are generally charged-off no later than

60 days past their due date. 
A loan

modified with

financial difficulties

is typically

in non-accrual

status at

the time

of the

modification. These

loans continue

in 
non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness

and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at

least six 
months of sustained performance after the modification (or one year for loans providing for quarterly or semi-annual payments)) and 
management has concluded that it is probable

that the borrower would not be in payment

default in the foreseeable future.
Loan modifications 
A modification

is subject to

disclosure under ASC

Topic

326 when the

Corporation separately concludes

that both

of the

following 
conditions exist: 1) the

debtor is experiencing financial difficulties

and 2) the modification

constitutes a reduction in

the interest rate 
on the

loan, a

payment extension,

a forgiveness

of principal,

a more-than-insignificant

payment delay,

or a

combination of

these. 
Determination

that

a

borrower

is

experiencing

financial

difficulties

involves

a

degree

of

judgment.

The

identification

of

loan 
modifications to debtors with financial difficulties is critical

in the determination of the adequacy of

the ACL.

Refer

to

Note

9

to

the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements

for

additional

qualitative

information

on

loan

modifications

and

the 
Corporation’s determination of the ACL.
Lease financing 
The

Corporation leases

passenger and

commercial

vehicles

and

equipment

to

individual

and

corporate

customers.

The

finance 
method of accounting

is used to

recognize revenue on lease

contracts that meet

the criteria specified in

the guidance for leases

in 
ASC Topic

842. Aggregate

rentals due

over the

term of

the leases

less unearned

income are

included in

finance lease

contracts 
receivable.

Unearned

income

is

amortized

using

a

method

which

results

in

approximate

level

rates

of

return

on

the

principal 
amounts outstanding. Finance lease origination

fees and costs

are deferred and amortized

over the average life

of the lease as

an 
adjustment to the interest yield. 
Revenue for other leases is recognized as it becomes

due under the terms of the agreement.
Loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality

Purchased credit

deteriorated (“PCD”) loans

are defined

as those

with evidence

of a

more-than-insignificant deterioration in

credit 
quality since origination.

PCD loans are initially recorded at its purchase price plus an

estimated allowance for credit losses (“ACL”). 
Upon the acquisition of a PCD loan, the Corporation makes an estimate

of the expected credit losses over the remaining contractual 
term

of

each individual

loan. The

estimated credit

losses over

the life

of the

loan are

recorded as

an ACL

with a

corresponding 
addition to the loan purchase price. The amount of the purchased

premium or discount which is not related to credit risk

is amortized 

124 
over the life of

the loan through net

interest income using the

effective interest method or

a method that approximates the

effective 
interest

method.

Changes

in

expected

credit

losses

are

recorded as

an

increase

or

decrease

to

the

ACL

with

a

corresponding 
charge

(reverse)

to

the

provision

for

credit

losses

in

the

Consolidated

Statement

of

Operations.

These

loans

follow

the

same 
nonaccrual policies as non-PCD loans. 
Refer to Note 7
to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information with respect

to loans acquired with

deteriorated 
credit quality.
Accrued interest receivable 
The

amortized

basis

for

loans

and

investments

in

debt

securities

is

presented

exclusive

of

accrued

interest

receivable.

The 
Corporation has elected

not to establish

an ACL for

accrued interest receivable for

loans and investments

in debt securities,

given 
the Corporation’s

non-accrual policies, in

which accrual

of interest is

discontinued and reversed

based on the

asset’s delinquency 
status.

Allowance for credit losses – loans portfolio 
The Corporation establishes an ACL

for its loan

portfolio based on its

estimate of credit losses

over the remaining contractual

term 
of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments. An ACL is recognized for all loans including originated and purchased loans, since 
inception, with

a corresponding charge

to the

provision for

credit losses,

except for

PCD loans

for which

the ACL

at acquisition

is 
recorded

as

an

addition

to

the

purchase

price

with

subsequent

changes

recorded

in

earnings.

Loan

losses

are

charged

and 
recoveries are credited to the ACL. 
The

Corporation

follows

a

methodology

to

estimate

the

ACL

which

includes

a

reasonable

and

supportable

forecast

period

for 
estimating

credit

losses,

considering

quantitative

and

qualitative

factors

as

well

as

the

economic

outlook.

As

part

of

this 
methodology,

management

evaluates

various

macroeconomic

scenarios

provided

by

third

parties.

At

December

31,

2024, 
management

applied

probability

weights

to

the

outcome

of

the

selected

scenarios.

This

evaluation

includes

benchmarking 
procedures

as

well

as

careful

analysis of

the

underlying assumptions

used to

build the

scenarios. The

application of

probability 
weights include baseline, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. The weights applied are subject to evaluation on a quarterly basis as 
part

of

the

ACL’s

governance

process. The

Corporation considers

additional

macroeconomic scenarios

as

part

of

its

qualitative 
adjustment framework.

The

macroeconomic variables

chosen

to

estimate credit

losses

were selected

by

combining

quantitative

procedures with

expert 
judgment.

These

variables

were

determined

to

be

the

best

predictors

of

expected

credit

losses

within

the

Corporation’s

loan 
portfolios and

include drivers such

as unemployment rate,

different measures

of employment levels,

house prices,

gross domestic 
product

and

measures

of

disposable

income,

amongst

others.

The

loss

estimation

framework

includes

a

reasonable

and 
supportable period of

2 years for

PR portfolios, gradually

reverting over a

3-years horizon to

historical macroeconomic variables at 
the

model

input

level.

For

the

U.S.

portfolio,

the

reasonable

and

supportable

period

considers

the

contractual

life

of

the

asset, 
impacted by

prepayments, except for

the U.S.

CRE portfolio. The

U.S. CRE portfolio

utilizes a 2-year

reasonable and supportable 
period gradually reverting, over a 3-years horizon,

to historical information at the output level.

The

Corporation

developed

loan

level

quantitative

models

distributed

by

geography

and

loan

type.

This

segmentation

was 
determined

by

evaluating

their

risk

characteristics,

which

include

default

patterns,

source

of

repayment,

type

of

collateral,

and 
lending

channels,

amongst

others.

The

modeling

framework

includes

competing

risk

models

to

generate

lifetime

defaults

and 
prepayments, and other loan

level modeling techniques to estimate

loss severity.

Recoveries on future losses

are contemplated as 
part

of

the

loss

severity

modeling.

These

parameters

are

estimated

by

combining

internal

risk

factors

with

macroeconomic 
expectations. In

order to

generate the

expected credit

losses, the

output of

these models

is combined

with loan

level repayment 
information.

The

internal

risk

factors

contemplated

within

the

models

may

include

borrowers’

credit

scores,

loan-to-value, 
delinquency status, risk ratings, interest rate, loan

term, loan age and type of collateral, amongst

others.

The ACL

also includes

a qualitative

framework that

addresses two

main components:

losses that

are expected

but not

captured 
within the quantitative modeling framework and model imprecision. In order to identify potential losses that

are not captured through 
the

models,

management

evaluates

model

limitations

as

well

as

the

different

risks

covered

by

the

variables

used

in

each 
quantitative model. The

Corporation considers additional macroeconomic

scenarios to address

these risks. This

assessment takes 
into

consideration factors

listed

as

part

of

ASC

326-20-55-4. To

complement

the

analysis, management

also

evaluates

whether 
there are sectors

that have low

levels of historical

defaults, but current

conditions show the

potential for future

losses. This type

of 
qualitative

adjustment

is

more

prevalent

in

the

commercial

portfolios.

The

model

imprecision

component

of

the

qualitative 

125 
adjustments

is

determined

after

evaluating

model

performance

for

these

portfolios

through

different

time

periods.

This

type

of 
qualitative adjustment mainly impacts consumer portfolios. 
The

Corporation

has

designated

as

collateral

dependent

loans

secured

by

collateral

when

foreclosure

is

probable

or

when 
foreclosure is

not probable but

the practical expedient

is used.

The practical expedient

is used

when repayment is

expected to

be 
provided

substantially

by

the

sale

or

operation

of

the

collateral

and

the

borrower is

experiencing financial

difficulty.

The

ACL

of 
collateral dependent loans

is measured based

on the fair

value of the

collateral less costs

to sell. The

fair value of

the collateral is 
based on appraisals, which may be adjusted due to their

age, and the type, location, and condition of the

property or area or general 
market conditions to reflect the expected change in

value between the effective date of the appraisal

and the measurement date.

The Credit Cards

portfolio, due to

its revolving nature,

does not have

a specified maturity date.

To

estimate the average remaining 
term

of

this

segment,

management evaluated

the

portfolios

payment

behavior

based

on

internal

historical data.

These payment 
behaviors were

further classified

into sub-categories

that accounted

for delinquency

history and

differences between

transactors, 
revolvers and customers that have exhibited mixed transactor/revolver behavior. Transactors are defined as active accounts without 
any

finance

charge

in

the

last

6

months.

The

paydown

curves

generated

for

each

sub-category

are

applied

to

the

outstanding 
exposure at

the measurement

date using

the first-in

first-out (FIFO)

methodology.

These amortization

patterns are

combined with 
loan level default and loss severity modeling to arrive

at the ACL.
Reserve for unfunded commitments 
The Corporation

establishes a

reserve for

unfunded commitments,

based on

the estimated

losses over

the remaining

term of

the 
facility.

An allowance

is not

established for

commitments that

are unconditionally

cancellable by

the Corporation.

Accordingly,

no 
reserve

is

established

for

unfunded commitments

related to

its

credit

cards

portfolio.

Reserve for

the

unfunded

portion

of

credit 
commitments

is

presented

within

other

liabilities

in

the

Consolidated Statements

of

Financial

Condition.

Net

adjustments

to

the 
reserve for unfunded commitments are

reflected in the Consolidated Statements

of Operations as provision for credit

losses for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Transfers and servicing of financial assets 
The transfer

of an

entire financial

asset, a

group of

entire financial

assets, or

a participating interest

in an

entire financial

asset in 
which the Corporation surrenders control over the assets is accounted

for as a sale

if all of the following conditions set forth in

ASC 
Topic

860 are met:

(1) the assets

must be isolated

from creditors of

the transferor,

(2) the transferee

must obtain the

right (free of 
conditions that constrain it

from taking advantage

of that right)

to pledge or

exchange the transferred assets,

and (3) the

transferor 
cannot maintain effective control over

the transferred assets through an agreement

to repurchase them before their

maturity. When 
the

Corporation

transfers

financial

assets

and

the

transfer

fails

any

one

of

these

criteria,

the

Corporation

is

prevented

from 
derecognizing the transferred financial

assets and the

transaction is accounted for

as a secured

borrowing. For federal and

Puerto 
Rico income

tax purposes,

the Corporation

treats the

transfers of

loans which

do not

qualify as

“true sales”

under the

applicable 
accounting guidance, as sales, recognizing a deferred

tax asset or liability on the transaction.

For transfers

of financial

assets that

satisfy the

conditions to

be accounted

for as

sales, the

Corporation derecognizes

all assets 
sold; recognizes all

assets obtained and liabilities

incurred in consideration as

proceeds of the

sale, including servicing

assets and 
servicing liabilities, if

applicable; initially measures

at fair

value assets obtained

and liabilities incurred

in a

sale; and

recognizes in 
earnings any gain or loss on the sale.

The guidance

on transfer

of financial

assets requires a

true sale

analysis of

the treatment

of the

transfer under state

law as

if the 
Corporation was a debtor under the bankruptcy code. A true sale legal analysis includes several legally relevant factors, such as the 
nature and level of recourse to the transferor, and the nature of retained interests in the loans sold. The analytical conclusion as to a 
true sale

is never

absolute and

unconditional, but

contains qualifications

based on

the inherent

equitable powers

of a

bankruptcy 
court, as

well as

the unsettled

state of

the common

law.

Once the

legal isolation

test has

been met,

other factors

concerning the 
nature

and

extent

of

the

transferor’s

control

over

the

transferred

assets

are

taken

into

account

in

order

to

determine

whether 
derecognition of assets is warranted.

The Corporation sells mortgage loans to the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”)

in the normal course of business 
and retains the servicing rights. The GNMA programs under which the loans

are sold allow the Corporation to repurchase individual 
delinquent loans that meet certain criteria. At the Corporation’s option, and without GNMA’s prior authorization, the Corporation may 
repurchase the delinquent

loan for an

amount equal to

100% of the

remaining principal balance

of the loan.

Once the Corporation 
has the

unconditional ability

to repurchase

the delinquent

loan, the

Corporation is

deemed to

have regained

effective control

over 

126 
the

loan

and

recognizes

the

loan

on

its

balance

sheet

as

well

as

an

offsetting

liability,

regardless of

the

Corporation’s

intent

to 
repurchase the loan.
Servicing assets 
The

Corporation

periodically

sells

or

securitizes

loans

while

retaining

the

obligation

to

perform

the

servicing

of

such

loans.

In 
addition,

the

Corporation

may

purchase

or

assume

the

right

to

service

loans

originated

by

others.

Whenever

the

Corporation 
undertakes an

obligation to

service a

loan, management

assesses whether

a servicing

asset or

liability should

be recognized.

A 
servicing

asset

is

recognized

whenever

the

compensation

for

servicing

is

expected

to

more

than

adequately

compensate

the 
servicer

for

performing

the

servicing.

Likewise,

a

servicing

liability

would

be

recognized

in

the

event

that

servicing

fees

to

be 
received are not

expected to adequately

compensate the Corporation

for its

expected cost. Mortgage servicing

assets recorded at 
fair value are separately presented on the Consolidated

Statements of Financial Condition.

All separately recognized servicing assets are initially recognized at fair value. For subsequent measurement of

servicing rights, the 
Corporation

has

elected

the

fair

value

method

for

mortgage

loans

servicing

rights

(“MSRs”).

Under

the

fair

value

measurement 
method,

MSRs

are

recorded

at

fair

value

each

reporting

period,

and

changes

in

fair

value

are

reported

in

mortgage

banking 
activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Contractual

servicing fees including ancillary income and late

fees, as well as 
fair

value

adjustments, are

reported in

mortgage

banking

activities in

the

Consolidated Statement

of

Operations. Loan

servicing 
fees, which are based on a percentage of the principal balances of the

loans serviced, are credited to income as loan payments are 
collected.

The fair value

of servicing rights is

estimated by using a

cash flow valuation model

which calculates the present value

of estimated 
future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected loan prepayment rates, discount

rates, servicing costs, 
and other economic factors, which are determined

based on current market conditions.
Premises and equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed on a

straight-
line basis over

the estimated useful

life of each

type of asset.

Amortization of leasehold

improvements is computed

over the fixed, 
non-cancelable terms

of the

respective lease

contracts or

the

estimated useful

lives

of the

asset, whichever

is shorter.

Costs of 
maintenance

and

repairs

which

do

not

improve

or

extend

the

life

of

the

respective

assets

are

expensed

as

incurred.

Costs

of 
renewals

and

betterments

are

capitalized.

When

assets

are

disposed

of,

their

cost

and

related

accumulated

depreciation

are 
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss

is reflected in earnings as realized or incurred,

respectively. 
The

Corporation

recognizes

right-of-use

assets

(“ROU

assets”)

and

lease

liabilities

relating

to

operating

and

finance

lease 
arrangements in its Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition within other assets and other liabilities, respectively. For finance 
leases, interest is recognized on the

lease liability separately from the amortization

of the ROU asset, whereas for

operating leases 
a single lease cost

is recognized so that

the cost of the

lease is allocated over

the lease term on

a straight-line basis. Impairments 
on ROU assets are evaluated under the guidance for impairment

or disposal of long-lived assets.

The Corporation recognizes gains 
on sale and

leaseback transactions in earnings when

the transfer constitutes a

sale, and the transaction

was at fair value.

Refer to 
Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information on operating and finance

lease arrangements.
Impairment of long-lived assets 
The

Corporation

evaluates

for

impairment

its

long-lived

assets

to

be

held

and

used,

and

long-lived

assets

to

be

disposed

of, 
whenever events or changes

in circumstances indicate that the

carrying amount of an

asset may not be recoverable

and records a 
write down for the difference between the carrying amount

and the fair value less costs to sell.

Other real estate 
Other

real

estate,

received

in

satisfaction

of

a

loan,

is

recorded

at

fair

value

less

estimated

costs

of

disposal.

The

difference 
between the carrying amount of the loan and the fair value less cost to

sell is recorded as an adjustment to the ACL. Subsequent to 
foreclosure, any

losses in

the carrying

value arising

from periodic

re-evaluations of the

properties, and any

gains or

losses on

the 
sale of these properties are credited or charged to expense in the period incurred and are included as OREO expenses. The cost of 
maintaining and operating such properties is expensed

as incurred. 
Updated appraisals

are obtained

to adjust

the value

of the

other real

estate assets.

The frequency

depends on

the loan

type and 
total credit exposure. The appraisal for a commercial or construction other real estate property with a book value

equal to or greater 
than $1 million is updated annually and if lower

than $1 million it is updated every two years.

For residential mortgage properties, the 
Corporation requests appraisals annually.

127 
Appraisals

may

be

adjusted

due

to

age,

collateral

inspections,

property

profiles,

or

general

market

conditions.

The

adjustments 
applied are based upon

internal information such

as other appraisals for

the type of

properties and/or loss severity

information that 
can provide historical trends in the real estate market

and may change from time to time based

on market conditions.
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill is recognized when the purchase price

is higher than the fair value

of net assets acquired in business combinations

under 
the purchase

method of

accounting. Goodwill

is not

amortized but

is tested

for impairment

at least

annually or

more frequently

if 
events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. If the

carrying amount of any of the

reporting units exceeds its fair value, the 
Corporation would be required to record an impairment

charge for the difference up to the amount of the goodwill. In determining

the 
fair

value

of

each

reporting

unit,

the

Corporation

generally

uses

a

combination

of

methods,

including

market

price

multiples

of 
comparable companies and transactions, as well as discounted cash flow analysis. Goodwill impairment

losses are recorded as part 
of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements

of Operations.

Other intangible assets deemed

to have an

indefinite life are

not amortized but are

tested for impairment using

a one-step process 
which compares the fair value with the carrying amount of the asset.

In determining that an intangible asset has an indefinite life, the 
Corporation

considers

expected

cash

inflows

and

legal,

regulatory,

contractual,

competitive,

economic

and

other

factors,

which 
could limit the intangible asset’s useful life.

Other

identifiable

intangible

assets

with

a

finite

useful

life,

mainly

core

deposits,

are

amortized

using

various

methods

over

the 
periods

benefited,

which

range

from

5

to

10

years.

These

intangibles are

evaluated

periodically for

impairment

when

events

or 
changes in circumstances

indicate that the carrying

amount may not

be recoverable. Impairments on

intangible assets with

a finite 
useful life are evaluated under the guidance for

impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.

Assets sold / purchased under agreements to repurchase

/ resell 
Repurchase and resell agreements

are treated as collateralized

financing transactions and are

carried at the

amounts at which the 
assets will be subsequently reacquired or resold as

specified in the respective agreements. 
It is the

Corporation’s policy to take possession

of securities purchased under agreements to

resell. However, the counterparties

to 
such

agreements

maintain

effective

control

over

such

securities,

and

accordingly

those

securities

are

not

reflected

in

the 
Corporation’s Consolidated Statements

of Financial

Condition. The Corporation

monitors the

fair value of

the underlying

securities 
as compared to the related receivable, including accrued

interest.

It

is

the

Corporation’s

policy

to

maintain

effective

control

over

assets

sold

under

agreements

to

repurchase;

accordingly,

such 
securities continue to be carried on the Consolidated

Statements of Financial Condition. 
The Corporation may require counterparties to deposit

additional collateral or return collateral pledged,

when appropriate.
Software 
Capitalized

software

is

stated

at

cost,

less

accumulated

amortization.

Capitalized

software

includes

purchased

software

and 
capitalizable application development costs associated with internally-developed software. Amortization, computed on a straight-line 
method, is charged to operations

over the estimated useful life

of the software. Capitalized software is

included in “Other assets” in 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.
Guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness

to others 
The estimated losses to be absorbed under the credit

recourse arrangements are recorded as a liability when

the loans are sold and 
are updated by

accruing or reversing expense

(categorized in the line

item “Adjustments (expense) to

indemnity reserves on loans 
sold”

in

the

Consolidated

Statements

of

Operations)

throughout

the

life

of

the

loan,

as

necessary,

when

additional

relevant 
information

becomes

available.

The

methodology

used

to

estimate

the

recourse

liability

considers

current

conditions, 
macroeconomic expectations through a 2-years reasonable and supportable period, gradually reverting to historical macroeconomic 
variables at the model input level over a 3-year period, portfolio

composition by risk characteristics, amongst other factors. Statistical 
methods are used

to estimate the

recourse liability.

Expected loss rates

are applied to

different loan segmentations.

The expected 
loss, which

represents the

amount expected

to be

lost on

a given

loan, considers

the probability

of default

and loss

severity.

The 
reserve

for

the

estimated

losses

under

the

credit

recourse

arrangements

is

presented

separately

within

other

liabilities

in

the 
Consolidated Statements of

Financial Condition. Refer

to Note

22 to

the Consolidated Financial

Statements for further

disclosures 
on guarantees.
Treasury stock 

128 
Treasury stock is

recorded at cost and

is carried as a

reduction of stockholders’ equity in

the Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Condition.

At the

date of

retirement or

subsequent reissue,

the treasury

stock account

is reduced

by

the cost

of such

stock.

At 
retirement, the excess of the cost of the treasury stock over

its par value is recorded entirely to surplus. At reissuance,

the difference 
between the consideration received upon issuance and

the specific cost is charged or credited to surplus.

Revenues from contract with customers 
Refer

to

Note

31

for

a

detailed

description

of

the

Corporation’s

policies

on

the

recognition

and

presentation

of

revenues

from 
contract with customers. 
Foreign exchange 
Assets and liabilities

denominated in foreign currencies

are translated to U.S.

dollars using prevailing rates

of exchange at

the end 
of

the

period.

Revenues, expenses,

gains

and

losses

are

translated using

weighted

average

rates

for

the

period.

The

resulting 
foreign currency translation adjustment

from operations for which

the functional currency is

other than the U.S.

dollar is reported in 
accumulated

other comprehensive

income

(loss), except

for

highly inflationary

environments in

which the

effects

are

included

in 
other operating expenses. 
The Corporation

holds interests

in Centro

Financiero BHD

León, S.A.

(“BHD León”)

in the

Dominican Republic.

The business

of 
BHD León is

mainly conducted in their

country’s foreign currency.

The resulting foreign currency

translation adjustment from these 
operations is reported in accumulated other comprehensive

income (loss).

Refer to the disclosure of accumulated other comprehensive

income (loss) included in Note 21.
Income taxes 
The Corporation

recognizes deferred tax

assets and

liabilities for

the expected

future tax

consequences of

events that

have been 
recognized in

the Corporation’s

financial statements

or tax

returns. Deferred

income tax

assets and

liabilities are

determined for 
differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible

amounts in the 
future.

The

computation

is

based

on

enacted

tax

laws

and

rates

applicable

to

periods

in

which

the

temporary

differences

are 
expected to be recovered or settled.

The

guidance for

income

taxes

requires a

reduction of

the

carrying

amounts

of

deferred tax

assets

by

a valuation

allowance if, 
based on the available evidence, it is more likely

than not (defined as a likelihood of more

than 50 percent) that such assets will not 
be

realized.

Accordingly,

the

need

to

establish

valuation

allowances

for

deferred

tax

assets

is

assessed

periodically

by

the 
Corporation

based

on

the

more

likely

than

not

realization

threshold

criterion.

In

the

assessment

for

a

valuation

allowance, 
appropriate consideration

is given

to all

positive and

negative evidence

related to

the realization

of the

deferred tax

assets. This 
assessment considers, among others,

all sources of

taxable income available to

realize the deferred tax

asset, including the future 
reversal of existing temporary differences, the future taxable income

exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, 
taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. In making such

assessments, significant weight is given to evidence 
that can be objectively verified.

The valuation

of deferred

tax assets

requires judgment

in assessing

the likely

future tax

consequences of

events that

have been 
recognized in the Corporation’s financial statements or tax returns and future profitability.

The Corporation’s accounting for deferred 
tax consequences represents management’s best estimate

of those future events.

Positions taken in

the Corporation’s

tax returns may

be subject to

challenge by the

taxing authorities upon

examination. Uncertain 
tax positions

are initially

recognized in the

financial statements when

it is

more likely than

not (greater than

50%) that

the position 
will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The amount 
of unrecognized tax benefit may increase or decrease in

the future for various reasons including adding amounts for

current tax year 
positions,
expiration of open income tax returns due to the statute of limitations, changes in management’s judgment about the level 
of

uncertainty,

including

addition

or

elimination

of

uncertain

tax

positions,

status

of

examinations, litigation,

settlements

with

tax 
authorities and legislative activity. 
The Corporation accounts for the taxes collected from customers

and remitted to governmental authorities on a net

basis (excluded 
from revenues). 
Income

tax

expense

or

benefit

for

the

year

is

allocated

among

continuing

operations,

discontinued

operations,

and

other 
comprehensive income (loss), as applicable. The amount allocated to continuing operations is the tax effect of the pre-tax income or 
loss from continuing operations that occurred during the year, plus or minus

income tax effects of (a) changes in circumstances that 

129 
cause

a

change

in

judgment

about

the

realization

of

deferred

tax

assets

in

future

years,

(b)

changes

in

tax

laws

or

rates,

(c) 
changes in tax status, and (d) tax-deductible

dividends paid to stockholders, subject to certain

exceptions.
Employees’ retirement and other postretirement benefit

plans 
Pension costs are

computed on the

basis of accepted

actuarial methods and are

charged to current

operations. Net pension costs 
are based

on various actuarial

assumptions regarding future

experience under the

plan, which include

costs for services

rendered 
during the

period, interest

costs and

return on

plan assets,

as well

as deferral

and amortization

of certain

items such

as actuarial 
gains or losses.

The funding policy is

to contribute to the

plan, as necessary,

to provide for services

to date and for

those expected to be

earned in 
the

future.

To

the

extent

that

these

requirements

are

fully

covered

by

assets

in

the

plan,

a

contribution

may

not

be

made

in

a 
particular year. 
The cost

of postretirement

benefits, which

is determined

based on

actuarial assumptions

and estimates

of the

costs of

providing 
these benefits in the future, is accrued during

the years that the employee renders the required

service. 
The guidance for compensation

retirement benefits of ASC

Topic

715 requires the recognition

of the funded status

of each defined 
pension

benefit

plan,

retiree

health

care

and

other

postretirement

benefit

plans

on

the

Consolidated

Statements

of

Financial 
Condition.

Stock-based compensation 
The

Corporation

opted

to

use

the

fair

value

method

of

recording

stock-based

compensation

as

described

in

the

guidance

for 
employee share plans in ASC Subtopic 718-50.
Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income

(loss) is

defined as

the change

in equity

of

a business

enterprise during

a period

from

transactions and 
other events

and circumstances,

except those

resulting from

investments by

owners and

distributions to

owners. Comprehensive 
income (loss) is separately presented in the Consolidated

Statements of Comprehensive Income.
Net income per common share 
Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends, including undeclared or 
unpaid dividends

if cumulative,

and charges

or credits

related to

the extinguishment

of preferred

stock or

induced conversions

of 
preferred stock, by the weighted average number of

common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per common

share 
takes into consideration the weighted average common shares adjusted for the effect of stock options, restricted stock, performance 
shares and warrants, if any, using the treasury stock method.
Statement of cash flows 
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash includes

cash on hand and amounts due from banks, including

restricted cash.

Codification Amendments 
in Response to the SEC’s

Disclosure Update and 
Simplification Initiative 
The FASB

issued ASU

2023-06 in

October 
2023

which

modifies

the

disclosure

or 
presentation

requirements

of

various 
subtopics

in

the

Codification

with

the 
purpose

of

aligning

U.S.

GAAP 
requirements

with

those

of

the

SEC

under 
Regulation S-X and S-K.

The date on which 
the SEC removes 
related disclosure 
requirements from 
Regulation S-X or 
Regulation S-K. If by 
June 30, 2027, the 
SEC has not 
removed the 
applicable 
requirements from 
Regulation S-X or 
Regulation S-K, the 
pending content of 
the related 
amendment will be 
removed from the 
Codification and will 
not become

effective for any 
entity. 
The Corporation

does not

expect to

be 
impacted

by

the

adoption

of

this

ASU 
since

it

is

subject

As of December 31, 2024, the portfolio of available-for-sale

debt securities reflects gross unrealized losses of $
1.3

billion (December 
31,

2023 -

$
1.4

billion), driven

mainly by

mortgage-backed securities,

which have

been impacted

by a

decline in

fair value

as a 
result of the rising interest rate environment.

The portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities is comprised mainly of U.S Treasuries 
and

obligations

from

the

U.S.

Government, its

agencies

or

government sponsored

entities,

including Federal

National

Mortgage 
Association

(“FNMA”),

Federal

Home

Loan

Mortgage

Corporation

(“FHLMC”)

and

Government

National

Mortgage

Association 
(“GNMA”).

These

securities

carry

an

explicit

or

implicit

guarantee

from

the

U.S.

Government,

are

highly

rated

by

major

rating 
agencies, and have a long history of no credit

losses. Accordingly, the Corporation applies a zero-credit loss assumption.

portfolio to the held-to-maturity securities portfolio.

Includes $
8.1

billion pledged to secure public and trust deposits that

the secured parties are not permitted to sell or repledge

the collateral. The 
Corporation had unpledged held-to-maturities securities with

a fair value of

$
67.3

million that could be used to increase its borrowing

facilities.
Securities not due

on a single

contractual maturity date,

such as collateralized

mortgage obligations, are classified

in the

period of 
final contractual maturity. The

expected maturities of collateralized mortgage obligations and certain other securities may differ from 
their contractual maturities because they may be

subject to prepayments or may be called by

the issuer.

Credit Quality Indicators 
The following describes the credit quality indicators by major security

type that the Corporation considers to develop the

estimate of 
the allowance for credit losses for investment securities

held-to-maturity. 
As discussed in Note

2 to the

Consolidated Financial Statement,

U.S. Treasury securities

carry an explicit guarantee

from the U.S. 
Government are

highly rated

by major

rating agencies

and have

a

long

history of

no credit

losses. Accordingly,

the

Corporation 
applies a zero-credit loss assumption and no allowance

for credit losses (“ACL”) for these securities

has been established. 

140 
At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the “Obligations

of Puerto Rico, States and political subdivisions” classified

as held-
to-maturity,

includes securities

issued by

municipalities of

Puerto Rico

that are

generally not

rated by

a credit

rating agency.

This 
includes $
13

million of general and special obligation bonds issued by three municipalities of Puerto Rico, that

are payable primarily 
from

certain

property

taxes

imposed

by

the

issuing

municipality

(December

31,

2023

-

$
19

million).

In

the

case

of

general 
obligations, they

also benefit

from a

pledge of

the full

faith, credit

and unlimited

taxing power

of the

issuing municipality,

which is 
required by law to levy property taxes in an amount sufficient for the payment of

debt service on such general obligation bonds. The 
Corporation performs periodic credit quality

reviews of these securities and internally

assigns standardized credit risk ratings based 
on its evaluation. The

Corporation considers these ratings in

its estimate to develop the

allowance for credit losses

associated with 
these

securities.

For

the

definitions

of

the

obligor

risk

ratings,

refer

to

the

Credit

Quality

section

of

Note

8

to

the

Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The

following

presents

the

amortized

cost

basis

of

securities

held

by

the

Corporation

issued

by

municipalities

of

Puerto

Rico 
aggregated by the internally assigned standardized

credit risk rating:

At December

31, 2024,

the portfolio

of “Obligations

of Puerto

Rico, States

and political

subdivisions” also

includes $
38

million in 
securities

issued

by

the

Puerto

Rico

Housing

Finance

Authority

(“HFA”),

a

government

instrumentality,

for

which

the

underlying 
source of payment is second mortgage loans in Puerto Rico

residential properties (not the government), but for which HFA, provides 
a guarantee

in the

event of default

and upon the

satisfaction of certain

other conditions (December

31, 2023 -

$
40

million). These 
securities are not rated by a credit rating agency.

The

Corporation

assesses

the

credit

risk

associated

with

these

securities

by

evaluating

the

refreshed

FICO

scores

of

a 
representative sample

of the

underlying borrowers.

As of

December 31,

2024, the

average refreshed

FICO score

for the

sample, 
comprised

of 
72
%

of

the

nominal

value

of

the

securities,

used

for

the

loss

estimate

was

of 
674

(compared

to 
67
%

and 
708
, 
respectively, at

December 31, 2023).

The loss estimates

for this portfolio

was based on

the methodology established

under CECL 
for

similar

loan

obligations.

The

Corporation

does

not

consider

the

government

guarantee

when

estimating

the

credit

losses 
associated with this portfolio. 
A 
deterioration of

the Puerto

Rico economy

or

of

the fiscal

health of

the

Government of

Puerto Rico

and/or

its

instrumentalities 
(including if any

of the issuing municipalities

become subject to a

debt restructuring proceeding under

PROMESA) could adversely 
affect the value of these securities, resulting in losses to

the Corporation.

Refer to

Note 23
to the

Consolidated Financial

Statements
for additional

information on

the Corporation’s

exposure to

the Puerto 
Rico Government. 
At December 31,

2024 and December

31, 2023, the

portfolio of “Obligations

of Puerto Rico,

States and political

subdivisions” also 
includes

$
7

million

in securities

issued

by the

HFA

for

which the

underlying source

of

payment

is U.S.

Treasury

securities.

The 
Corporation applies a 
zero
-credit loss assumption for

these securities, and no

ACL has been

established for these securities

given 
that U.S. Treasury

securities carry an

explicit guarantee from the

U.S. Government, are

highly rated by

major rating agencies,

and 
have a long history of no credit losses. Refer

to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

for further details.
Delinquency status 
At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,

there were 
no

securities held-to-maturity in past due or non-performing

status.
Allowance for credit losses on debt securities held-to-maturity 
The following table provides the

from non-performing status, of which $
207

million are 90 days or more past due. The portfolio

of 
guaranteed loans includes $
65

million of residential mortgage loans in Puerto Rico that

are no longer accruing interest as of December 31,

At December 31, 2023, mortgage loans held-in-portfolio

include $
2.2

billion of loans that carry certain guarantees from

the FHA or the VA, for 
which the Corporation’s policy is to exclude them

from non-performing status, of which $
242

million are 90 days or more past due. The portfolio

of 
guaranteed loans includes $
106

million of residential mortgage loans in Puerto

Rico that are no longer accruing interest as of December

31, 2023. 
The Corporation has approximately $
38

million in reverse mortgage loans in Puerto Rico which

are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently 
not accruing interest at December 31, 2023. 
[2] 
Loans held-in-portfolio are net of $
356

million in unearned income and exclude $
4

million in loans held-for-sale. 
[3] 
Includes $
14.2

billion pledged to secure credit facilities and public funds

that the secured parties are not permitted to sell or repledge

the collateral, 
of which $
7.0

billion were pledged at the FHLB as collateral for borrowings

and $
7.2

billion at the FRB for discount window borrowings. As

of 
December 31, 2023, the Corporation had an available borrowing

facility with the FHLB and the discount window

of FRB of $
3.5

billion and $
4.4
billion, respectively.
Recognition of interest income on mortgage loans is generally discontinued when loans are 90 days or more in arrears on payments 
of principal or interest. The Corporation discontinues the recognition of interest income on residential mortgage loans insured by the 
FHA or guaranteed by the VA when 15 months

delinquent as to principal or interest, since the principal repayment on these loans is 
insured. 
Loans with

a delinquency

status of

90 days

past due

as of

December 31,

2024 include

$
9

million in

loans previously

pooled into 
GNMA securities (December 31, 2023 -

$
11

million). Under the GNMA program, issuers

such as BPPR have the

option but not the 
obligation to repurchase loans

that are 90

days or more

past due. For

accounting purposes, these loans

subject to the

repurchase 
option

are

required to

be

reflected on

the

financial statements

of BPPR

with

an

offsetting

liability.

Loans

in

our

serviced

GNMA 
portfolio benefit

from payment

forbearance programs

but continue

to reflect

the contractual

delinquency until

the borrower

repays 
deferred payments or completes a payment deferral

modification or other borrower assistance alternative.

The Corporation has

designated loans classified as

collateral dependent for

which the ACL

is measured based

on the fair

value of 
the collateral less

cost to sell,

when foreclosure is

probable or when

the repayment is

expected to be

provided substantially by the 
sale or

operation of

the collateral

and the

borrower is

experiencing financial

difficulty.

The fair

value of

the collateral

is based

on 
appraisals,

which

may

be

adjusted

due

to

their

age,

type,

location,

and

condition

of

the

property

or

area

or

general

market 
conditions to reflect the expected change in value between the effective date

of the appraisal and the measurement date. Appraisals 
are updated every one to two years depending on

the type of loan and the total exposure of

the borrower. 
Loans in non-accrual status with no

allowance at December 31, 2024 include

$
124

million in collateral dependent loans (December 
31, 2023 - $
126

million). The Corporation recognized $
4

million in interest income on

non-accrual loans in each of

the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
The following tables present the amortized cost basis

of collateral-dependent loans, for which the ACL was measured

based on the 
fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, by class

of loans and type of collateral as of December

Note 8 – Allowance for credit losses – loans

held-in-portfolio
The
Corporation follows

the current

expected credit

loss (“CECL”)

model, to

establish and

evaluate the

adequacy of

the ACL

to 
provide for

expected losses

in the

loan portfolio.

This model

establishes a forward-looking

methodology that

reflects the

expected 
credit losses over the lives of financial assets, starting when such

assets are first acquired or originated. In addition, CECL provides 
that

the

initial ACL

on PCD

financial

assets be

recorded as

an

increase to

the

purchase price,

with subsequent

changes to

the 
allowance

recorded

as

a

credit

loss

expense.

The

provision

for

credit

losses

recorded

in

current

operations

is

based

on

this 
methodology.

Loan losses

are charged,

and recoveries

are credited

to the

ACL. The

Corporation’s modeling

framework includes 
competing risk

models that

generate lifetime

default and

prepayment estimates as

well as

other loan

level techniques

to estimate 
loss

severity.

These

models

combine

credit

risk

factors,

which

include

the

impact

of

loan

modifications,

with

macroeconomic 
expectations to derive the lifetime expected loss.

As part of the Corporation’s model governance procedures, a

new model was implemented during the fourth quarter of 2024 for

the 
P.R.

commercial real

estate non-owner occupied

segment. The new

model revisits the

selection of macroeconomic

and loan level 
variables to

address the underlying

risks of the

loan segment. The

new model

yielded a

reduction of $
13.5

million in BPPR’s

ACL 
during

the

fourth

quarter of

2024. Continued

strength

in the

Puerto

Rico

labor

market

and stable

credit

metrics

for

this

portfolio 
contributed in the reduction in reserves. 
At

December

31,

2024,

the

Corporation

estimated

the

ACL

by

weighting

the

outputs

of

optimistic,

baseline,

and

pessimistic 
scenarios. Among

the three

scenarios used

to estimate

the ACL,

the baseline

is assigned

the highest

probability,

followed by

the 
pessimistic

scenario

given

the

uncertainties

in

the

economic

outlook

and

downside

risk.

The

weightings

applied

are

subject

to 
evaluation on

a quarterly

basis as

part of

the ACL’s

governance process. The

Corporation evaluates, at

least on

an annual

basis, 
the

assumptions

tied

to

the

CECL

accounting

framework.

These

include

the

reasonable

and

supportable

period

as

well

as

the 
reversion window.
The

following

tables

present

the

changes

in

the

ACL

of

loans

held-in-portfolio

and

unfunded

commitments

for

the

years

ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

the

of

that

have

been

modified

during

the

twelve

months

preceding 
December 31, 2024. The

past due 90

days or more

categories includes all loans

modified classified as

non-accruing at the time

of 
the modification. These loans will continue in non-accrual status, and presented as past due 90 days or more, until the borrower has 
demonstrated a willingness and

ability to make

the restructured loan payments

(at least six

months of sustained

performance after 
the modification

or one

year for

loans providing

for quarterly

or semi-annual

payments) and

management has

concluded that

it is

Credit Quality
The

Corporation

has

defined

a

risk

rating

system

to

assign

a

rating

to

all

credit

exposures,

particularly

for

the

commercial

and 
construction loan

portfolios. Risk

ratings in

the aggregate

provide the

Corporation’s management

the asset

quality profile

for

the 
loan portfolio. The risk rating system provides for the

assignment of ratings at the obligor level based

on the financial condition of the 
borrower. The risk rating analysis process is performed at least once a

year or more frequently if events or conditions change which 
may

deteriorate

the

credit

quality.

In

the

case

of

consumer

and

mortgage

loans,

these

loans

are

classified

considering

their 
delinquency status at the end of the reporting period.
The Corporation’s obligor risk rating scales range from rating 1 (Excellent) to rating 14 (Loss). The obligor risk rating reflects the risk 
of payment default of a borrower in the ordinary

course of business.

Pass Credit Classifications: 
Pass (Scales 1 through 8)

– Loans classified as

pass have a well defined

primary source of repayment, with no

apparent 
risk, strong financial position, minimal operating risk, profitability, liquidity and strong

capitalization.

Watch

(Scale 9)

– Loans

classified as

watch have

acceptable business

credit,

but borrower’s

operations, cash

flow or 
financial condition evidence more than average risk, requires above

average levels of supervision and attention from Loan 
Officers. 
Special Mention (Scale 10) -

Loans classified as special mention have

potential weaknesses that deserve management’s 
close attention.

If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result

in deterioration of the repayment prospects for 
the loan or of the Corporation’s credit position at

some future date.

Adversely Classified Classifications: 
Substandard

(Scales

11

and

12)

-

Loans

classified

as

substandard

are

deemed

to

be

inadequately

protected

by

the 
current net worth

and payment capacity

of the obligor

or of the

collateral pledged, if

any.

Loans classified as

such have 
well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of

the debt.

They are characterized by the

distinct possibility that 
the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies

are not corrected.

Doubtful (Scale

13) - Loans

classified as

doubtful have

all the

weaknesses inherent

in those

classified as

substandard, 
with the

additional characteristic

that the

weaknesses make

the collection

or liquidation

in full,

on the

basis of

currently 
existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable

and improbable.

Loss

(Scale

14)

-

Uncollectible

and

of

such

little

value

that

continuance

as

a

bankable

asset

is

not

warranted.

This 
classification does

not mean

that the

asset has

absolutely no

recovery or

salvage value,

but rather

it is

not practical

or 
desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial

recovery may be effected in the future. 
Risk

ratings scales

10

through

14

conform

to

regulatory

ratings.

The

assignment

of

the

obligor

risk

rating

is

based

on

relevant 
information about the ability of borrowers to

service their debts such as current

financial information, historical payment experience, 
credit documentation, public information, and

current economic trends, among other factors.

The following tables present the amortized cost basis, net of unearned income, of

loans held-in-portfolio based on the Corporation’s 
assignment of obligor risk ratings as defined at

December 31, 2024 and 2023 by vintage year.

During the

year ended

December 31,

2024, the

Corporation retained

servicing rights

on whole

loan sales

involving approximately 
$
44

million in

principal balance outstanding

(2023 -

$
50

million), with net

realized gains

of approximately $
1.1

million (2023

- $
0.7
million). All loan sales performed during the

years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were without

credit recourse agreements.

The Corporation recognizes as assets the rights to service loans for others,

whether these rights are purchased or result from asset 
transfers such as sales and securitizations. These mortgage

servicing rights (“MSRs”) are measured at fair

value. 
The

Corporation

uses

a

discounted

cash

flow

model

to

estimate

the

fair

value

of

MSRs.

The

discounted

cash

flow

model 
incorporates

assumptions

that

market

participants

would

use

in

estimating

future

net

servicing

income,

including

estimates

of 
prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, prepayment and late 
fees, among other considerations. Prepayment speeds are

adjusted for the loans’ characteristics and portfolio behavior.

The following table

presents the changes

in MSRs measured

using the fair

value method for

the years ended

December 31, 2024 
and 2023.

1.9

million (December 31, 2023 - $
1.9

million).
During the

quarter ended June

30, 2023

the Corporation terminated

a servicing agreement,

in which it

acted as sub-servicer

for a 
third

party,

for

a

portfolio

with

an

unpaid

principal

balance

of

approximately

$
260

million

and

a

related

MSR

fair

value

of 
approximately $
2

million.

The transaction did not result in a material

effect on the financial results of the Corporation. 
Residential mortgage loans serviced for others were $
9.0

billion at December 31, 2024 (2023 - $
9.9

billion). 
Net mortgage servicing fees, a component of mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, include the 
changes from period to period in the fair value of the MSRs, including changes due to collection / realization of expected cash flows. 
The banking

subsidiaries receive servicing

fees based

on a

percentage of the

outstanding loan balance.

These servicing fees

are 
credited to

income when they

are collected. At

December 31,

2024, those

weighted average mortgage

servicing fees

were 
0.32
% 
(2023 – 
0.31
%). Under these

servicing agreements, the

banking subsidiaries do

not generally earn

significant prepayment penalty 
fees on the underlying loans serviced. 
The section

below includes

information on

assumptions used

in the

valuation model

of the

MSRs, originated

and purchased. 
Key 
economic assumptions used

in measuring the

servicing rights derived

from loans securitized

or sold by

the Corporation during

the 
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were

The sensitivity analyses presented in the table above for servicing rights are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the 
figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a 10 and 20 percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated 
because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the sensitivity tables 
included herein, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without 
changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, increases in market 
interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

At December 31, 2024, the Corporation serviced $
495

million (2023 - $
561

million) in residential mortgage loans with credit recourse 
to the Corporation, from

which $
12

million was 60

days or more past

due (2023 - $
13

million). Also refer to

Note 22 for information 
on changes in the Corporation’s liability of estimated losses

related to loans serviced with credit recourse. 
During

the

year

ended

December

31,

2024,

the

Corporation

repurchased

approximately

$
38

million

of

mortgage

loans

from

its 
GNMA servicing portfolio (2023 - $
44

million). The determination to repurchase these loans

was based on the economic benefits

of 
the transaction, which results in a reduction of the servicing costs for

these severely delinquent loans, mostly related to principal and 
interest advances. The

risk associated with

the loans is

reduced due to

their guaranteed nature.

The Corporation may place

these 
loans under modification

programs offered by

FHA, VA

or United States

Department of Agriculture (USDA)

or other loss

mitigation 
programs offered by the Corporation, and once brought back to

current status, these may be either retained in portfolio or

re-sold in 
the secondary market.

Note 14 – Goodwill and other intangible assets
During the

year ended

December 31,

2024, the

Corporation recognized a

write-down to goodwill

due to

the sale

of its

daily-rental 
business. During the

third quarter of

2023, the Corporation recorded

an impairment of

$
23

million as a

result of its

annual goodwill 
impairment test related to its U.S. based equipment leasing subsidiary, Popular Equipment Finance (“PEF”), due to lower forecasted 
cash flows and an increase in the rate used

to discount cash flows. 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the

year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, allocated

by reportable segments, 
were as follows (refer to Note 36 for the definition

Results of the Annual Goodwill Impairment Test 

The Corporation’s goodwill and

other identifiable intangible assets having

an indefinite useful life

are tested for impairment,

at least 
annually and

on a

more frequent basis

if events

or circumstances indicate

impairment could have

taken place. Such

events could 
include,

among others,

a significant

adverse change

in the

business climate,

an adverse

action by

a regulator,

an unanticipated 
change in the competitive environment and a decision

to change the operations or dispose of a

reporting unit.

Management

monitors

events

or

changes

in

circumstances

between

annual

tests

to

determine

if

these

events

or

changes

in 
circumstances would more likely than not reduce

the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying

amounts. 
The Corporation

performed the

annual goodwill

impairment evaluation

for the

entire organization

during the

third quarter

of 2024 
using July 31, 2024 as the annual evaluation date. The reporting units

utilized for this evaluation were those that are one level below 
the business segments,

which are the

legal entities within the

reportable segment. The Corporation

follows push-down accounting, 
as such all goodwill is assigned to the reporting

units when carrying out a business combination. 
In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the Corporation generally uses a combination of methods, including market price 
multiples

of

comparable

companies

and

transactions,

as

well

as

discounted

cash

flow

analysis.

Management

evaluates

the 
particular circumstances

of each

reporting unit

in order

to determine

the most

appropriate valuation methodology

and the

weights 
applied

to

each

valuation

methodology,

as

applicable.

The

Corporation

evaluates

the

results

obtained

under

each

valuation 
methodology to

identify and

understand the

key

value drivers

in order

to

ascertain that

the

results obtained

are

reasonable and 
appropriate

under

the

circumstances.

Elements

considered

include

current

market

and

economic

conditions,

developments

in 
specific lines of business, and any particular

features in the individual reporting units.

The computations

require management

to make

estimates and

assumptions. Critical

assumptions that

are used

as part

of these 
evaluations include: 
●

a selection of comparable publicly traded companies,

based on nature of business, location and

size; 
●

a selection of comparable acquisitions; 
●

the discount rate applied to future earnings, based

on an estimate of the cost of equity; 
●

the potential future earnings of the reporting unit;

and 
●

the market growth and new business assumptions. 
For

purposes

of

the

market

comparable

companies’

approach,

valuations

were

determined

by

calculating

price

multiples

(using 
averages or applying regression analyses) of relevant value drivers from a

group of companies that are comparable to the reporting 
unit being analyzed and

applying those price multiples

to the value drivers

of the reporting unit.

Management uses judgment in

the 
determination

of

which

value

drivers

are

considered

more

appropriate

for

each

reporting

unit.

Comparable

companies’

price 
multiples represent minority-based multiples and thus, a control premium adjustment is added to the comparable

companies’ market 
multiples applied to the reporting unit’s value drivers.

For purposes

of the

market comparable transactions’

approach, valuations had

been previously determined

by the

Corporation by 
calculating

average

price

multiples

of

relevant

value

drivers

from

a

group

of

transactions

for

which

the

target

companies

are 
comparable to the reporting unit being analyzed and

applying those price multiples to the value drivers

of the reporting unit. 
For purposes

of the

discounted cash flows

(“DCF”) approach, the

valuation is

based on

estimated future cash

flows. The

financial 
projections

used

in

the

DCF

valuation

analysis

for

each

reporting

unit

are

based

on

the

most

recent

(as

of

the

valuation

date) 
financial

projections presented

to

the

Corporation’s Asset

/

Liability Management

Committee (“ALCO”).

The

growth assumptions 
included

in

these

projections

are

based

on

management’s

expectations for

each

reporting

unit’s

financial

prospects

considering 

195 
economic and industry conditions as well

as particular plans of each entity

(i.e. restructuring plans, de-leveraging, etc.). The cost

of 
equity used to

discount the cash flows

was calculated using the

Ibbotson Build-Up Method and

ranged from 
11.99
% to 
15.93
% for 
the 2024 analysis. The Ibbotson Build-Up Method

builds up a cost of equity

starting with the rate of

return of a “risk-free” asset (20-
year U.S. Treasury

note) and adds

to it additional

risk elements such as

equity risk premium, size

premium, industry risk

premium, 
and a

specific geographic risk

premium (as applicable).

The resulting discount

rates were

analyzed in terms

of reasonability given 
the current market conditions.
The

results

of

the

BPPR

annual

goodwill

impairment

test

as

of

July

31,

2024

indicated

that

the

estimated

fair

value

using

a 
combination of

valuation methodologies

exceeded BPPR’s

equity value

by

approximately $
3.7

billion or 
303
%

compared to

$
3.7
billion or 
468
%, for the annual goodwill impairment test completed as

of July 31, 2023. PB’s annual

goodwill impairment test results 
as of such dates indicated that the estimated fair value

using a combination of valuation methodologies exceeded PB’s equity value 
by approximately $
584

million or 
34
%, compared to $
129

million or 
8
%, for the annual goodwill impairment test completed as of July 
31, 2023.

Accordingly, 
no

impairment was

recognized for

BPPR or

PB. The

goodwill balance

of BPPR

and PB,

as legal

entities, 
represented approximately 
93
% of the Corporation’s total goodwill balance as of the

July 31, 2024 valuation date. 
Furthermore,

as

part

of

the

analyses,

management

performed

a

reconciliation

of

the

aggregate

fair

values

determined

for

the 
reporting units to the market capitalization of the Corporation concluding that the

fair value results determined for the reporting units 
in the July 31, 2024 annual assessment were reasonable. 
The goodwill

impairment evaluation

process requires

the Corporation

to

make estimates

and assumptions

with regard

to the

fair 
value

of

the

reporting

units.

Actual

values

may

differ

significantly

from

these

estimates.

Such

differences

could

result

in

future 
impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively

impact the Corporation’s results of operations and the

reporting units where the 
goodwill is recorded. Particularly for reporting units with recognized impairments or where the

estimated fair value approximates the 
equity value,

future decreases

in fair

value estimates

could result

in additional

impairment charges.

Additionally,

declines in

the 
Corporation’s

market

capitalization and

adverse economic

conditions

sustained

over

a

longer

period of

time

negatively

affecting 
forecasted earnings could increase the risk of goodwill

impairment in the future.

A decline in

the Corporation’s stock

price related to

global and/or regional macroeconomic

conditions, a deterioration in

the Puerto 
Rico

or

the

U.S.

economies,

increases

in

the

rate

to

discount

future

cash

flows,

and

lower

future

earnings

estimates

could, 
individually or

in the

aggregate, have a

material impact on

the determination of

the fair value

of our reporting

units, which could

in 
turn

result

in

an

impairment of

goodwill in

the

future.

An

impairment of

goodwill would

result

in

a non-cash

expense,

net

of

tax 
impact. A charge to earnings related to a goodwill

impairment would not materially impact regulatory

capital calculations.

of goodwill and accumulated impairment losses

At December 31, 2024, the Corporation had brokered

deposits amounting to $ 
1.6

billion (December 31, 2023 - $
1.7

billion). 
The aggregate amount of overdrafts

in demand deposit accounts that

were reclassified to loans was $
10.4

million at December 31, 
2024 (December 31, 2023 - $
9.1

million). 
At December 31,

2024, Puerto Rico

government deposits amounted to

$
19.5

billion. Puerto Rico

government deposits are interest 
bearing accounts.

These government

deposits are

indexed to

short-term market

rates and

fluctuate in

cost with

changes in

those 
rates, in

accordance with contractual

terms. Public

deposit balances are

difficult to

predict. For example,

the receipt

by the Puerto 
Rico

Government

of

hurricane

recovery

related

Federal

assistance

and

seasonal

tax

collections

could

increase

public

deposit 
balances at BPPR.

On the other hand,

the amount and

timing of reductions

in balances are

likely to be

impacted by,

for example, 
the

speed

at

which

federal

assistance

is

distributed,

reductions

in

federal

funding,

the

financial

condition,

liquidity

and

cash 
management

practices

of

the

Puerto

Rico

Government

and

its

instrumentalities

and

the

implementation

of

fiscal

and

debt 
adjustment plans approved

pursuant to PROMESA

or other actions

mandated by the

Fiscal Oversight and

Management Board for 
Puerto

Rico

(the

“Oversight

Board”).

Generally,

these

deposits

require

that

the

bank

pledge

high

credit

quality

securities

as 
collateral, therefore, liquidity risk arising from government

deposit outflows are lower.

Note 16 – Borrowings 
Assets sold under agreements to repurchase 
Assets sold under agreements to repurchase amounted

to $
55

million at December 31, 2024 and $
91

million at December 31, 2023.
The Corporation’s

repurchase transactions are

overcollateralized with the

securities detailed in

the table

under

the

supplemental

terms

of

the

master 
repurchase agreements.

In an

event of

Repurchase agreements in this portfolio are generally short-term, often overnight.

As such, our risk is very

limited.

We manage the 
liquidity risks arising from secured

funding by sourcing funding globally from

a diverse group of counterparties, providing

a range of 
securities collateral and pursuing longer durations,

when appropriate.

At

December

31,

2024

and

December

31,

2023,

the

Corporation had

FHLB

borrowing

facilities

whereby

the

Corporation could 
borrow up to

$
4.7

billion and $
4.2

billion, respectively,

of which $
0.5

billion and $
0.4

billion, respectively,

were used. In

addition, at 
December

31,

2024

and

December

31,

2023,

the

Corporation

had

placed

$
0.3

billion

of

the

available

FHLB

credit

facility

as 
collateral for municipal letters of credit

to secure deposits. The FHLB

borrowing facilities are collateralized with securities

and loans 
held-in-portfolio, and do not have restrictive covenants

or callable features.

Also, at

December 31, 2024,

the Corporation had

borrowing facilities at

the discount window

of the Federal

Reserve Bank of

New 
York amounting to $
7.0

billion (December 31, 2023 - $
4.4

billion), which remained unused at December 31, 2024

and December 31, 
2023.

The facilities are a collateralized source

of credit that is highly reliable even under difficult

market conditions.

201 
Note 17 – Trust preferred securities 
Statutory trusts established by the Corporation (Popular North

America Capital Trust I

and Popular Capital Trust II) had

issued trust 
preferred

securities

(also

referred

to

as

“capital

securities”)

to

the

public.

The

proceeds

from

such

issuances,

together

with

the 
proceeds of the related issuances of common securities of the trusts (the “common securities”), were used by the trusts to purchase 
junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (the

“junior subordinated debentures”) issued by the

Corporation.

The sole

assets of

the trusts

consisted of

the junior

subordinated debentures

of the

Corporation and

the related

accrued interest 
receivable. These trusts are not consolidated

by the Corporation pursuant to accounting

principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. 
The junior subordinated

debentures are included

by the Corporation

as notes payable

in the Consolidated

Statements of Financial 
Condition, while

the common

securities issued

by the

issuer trusts

are included

as debt

securities held-to-maturity.

The common 
securities of each trust are wholly-owned, or indirectly

wholly-owned, by the Corporation.

accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The

maturity of the junior subordinated debentures may

be shortened at the option of the 
Corporation prior to their stated maturity dates (i) on or

after the stated optional redemption dates stipulated in

the agreements, in whole at any time or 
in part from time to time, or (ii) in whole, but not in part,

at any time within 90 days following the occurrence

and during the continuation of a tax event,

Statutory reserve 
The

Banking

Act

of

the

Commonwealth of

Puerto

Rico

requires that 
a minimum of 10% of BPPR’s net income

for

the

year

be 
transferred to

a statutory

reserve account

until such

statutory reserve

equals the

total of

paid-in capital

on common

and preferred 
stock. Any losses

incurred by a

bank must first

be charged to

retained earnings and then

to the reserve

fund. Amounts credited

to 
the

reserve

fund

may

not

be

used

to

pay

dividends

without

the

prior

consent

of

the

Puerto

Rico

Commissioner

of

Financial 
Institutions.

The

failure

to

maintain

sufficient

statutory

reserves

would

preclude

BPPR

from

paying

dividends.

BPPR’s

statutory 
reserve fund

amounted to $
961

million at

December 31, 2024

(2023 - $
908

million; 2022 -

$
863

million). During

2024, $
53

million 
was transferred to the statutory reserve account (2023 - $
45

million, 2022 - $
77

million). BPPR was in compliance with the statutory 
reserve requirement in 2024, 2023 and 2022.

205 
Note 20 – Regulatory capital requirements 
The Corporation,

BPPR and

PB are

subject to

various regulatory

capital requirements

imposed by

the federal

banking agencies. 
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can

lead to certain mandatory and additional

discretionary actions by regulators that, 
if undertaken,

could have

a direct

material effect

on the

Corporation’s consolidated financial

statements. Popular,

Inc., BPPR

and 
PB are

subject to

Basel III

capital requirements,

including minimum

and well

capitalized regulatory

capital ratios

and compliance 
with the standardized approach for determining

risk-weighted assets.

The Basel III Capital

Rules established a Common Equity

Tier I (“CET1”) capital

measure and related regulatory capital ratio

CET1 
to risk-weighted assets.

The Basel III Capital Rules provide that a

depository institution will be deemed to be well capitalized if

it maintained a leverage ratio 
of at

least 
5
%, a

CET1 ratio of

at least 
6.5
%, a Tier

1 risk-based capital

ratio of at

least 
8
% and

a total risk-based

ratio of

at least 
10
%.

Management

has

determined

that

at

December

31,

2024

and

2023,

the

Corporation

exceeded

all

capital

adequacy 
requirements to which it is subject. 
The Corporation

has

been designated

by the

Federal Reserve

Board as

a Financial

Holding Company

(“FHC”) and

is eligible

to 
engage in certain financial activities permitted under

the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. 
Pursuant to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on

January 1, 2020, the Corporation elected to use a

five-year transition 
period

option

as

permitted

in

the

final

interim

regulatory

capital

rules

effective

March

31,

2020.

The

five-year

transition

period 
provision delays for two years the estimated impact of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital, followed 
by a three-year transition period to phase out

the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided

during the initial two-year delay. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, BPPR and

PB were well-capitalized under the regulatory

framework for prompt corrective action.

The following

tables present

the Corporation’s

risk-based capital

and leverage

ratios at

2024 and

2023

- $
561

million) in

residential mortgage

loans 
subject to

credit recourse

provisions, principally loans

associated with

FNMA and

FHLMC residential

mortgage loan

securitization 
programs. In the event

of any customer default, pursuant to

the credit recourse provided, the

Corporation is required to repurchase 
the

loan

or

reimburse

the

third

party

investor

for

the

incurred

loss.

The

maximum

potential

amount of

future

payments

that

the 
Corporation

would

be

required

to

make

under

the

recourse

arrangements

in

the

event

of

nonperformance

by

the

borrowers

is 
equivalent

to

the

total

outstanding

balance

of

the

residential

mortgage

loans

serviced

with

recourse

and

interest,

if

applicable. 
During 2024,

the Corporation

repurchased approximately

$
2

million of

unpaid principal

balance in

mortgage loans

subject to

the 
credit recourse

provisions (2023

- $
2

million). In

the event

of nonperformance

by the

borrower,

the Corporation

has rights

to the 
underlying

collateral

securing

the

mortgage

loan.

The

Corporation

suffers

losses

on

these

loans

when

the

proceeds

from

a 
foreclosure sale

of the

property underlying

a defaulted

mortgage loan

are less

than the

outstanding principal

balance of

the loan 
plus any

uncollected interest

advanced and

the costs

of holding

and disposing

the related

property.

At

December 31,

2024, the 
Corporation’s liability

established to cover

the estimated credit

loss exposure

related to loans

sold or serviced

with credit

recourse 
amounted to

$
3

million (December

31,

2023 -

$
4

million).

The following

table shows

the changes

in the

Corporation’s liability

of 
estimated losses from

The estimated losses to be absorbed under the credit

recourse arrangements are recorded as a liability when

the loans are sold and 
are updated by

accruing or reversing expense

(categorized in the line

item “Adjustments (expense)

to indemnity reserves on

loans 
sold”

in

the

consolidated

statements

of

operations)

throughout

the

life

of

the

loan,

as

necessary,

when

additional

relevant 
information becomes available. The

methodology used to

estimate the recourse

liability is a

function of the

recourse arrangements 
given and

considers a

variety of

factors, which

include actual

defaults and

historical loss

experience, foreclosure

rate, estimated 
future defaults

and the

probability that

a loan

would be

delinquent. Statistical

methods are

used to

estimate the

recourse liability. 
Expected loss

rates are

applied to

different loan

segmentations. The

expected loss,

which represents

the amount

expected to

be 
lost on a given loan, considers the

probability of default and loss severity.

The probability of default represents the probability that

a 
loan in

good standing

would become

90 days

delinquent within

the following

twelve-month period.

Regression analysis

quantifies 
the relationship

between the

default event

and loan-specific

characteristics, including

credit scores,

loan-to-value ratios,

and loan 
aging, among others.

When the

Corporation sells or

securitizes mortgage loans,

it generally makes

customary representations and

warranties regarding 
the characteristics

of the

loans sold. The

Corporation’s mortgage operations

in Puerto

Rico group conforming

mortgage loans into 
pools which are

exchanged for FNMA and

GNMA mortgage-backed securities, which are

generally sold to

private investors, or are 
sold directly

to FNMA

for cash.

As required

under the

government agency

programs, quality

review procedures

are performed

by 
the Corporation to

ensure that asset

guideline qualifications are met.

To

the extent the

loans do not

meet specified characteristics, 
the

Corporation may

be required

to

repurchase such

loans or

indemnify for

losses and

bear any

subsequent loss

related to

the 
loans. The

amount purchased

under representation

and warranty

arrangements during

the years

ended December

31, 2024

and

December 31, 2023 was not considered material

for the Corporation. 
From

time

to

time, the

Corporation sells

loans and

agrees to

indemnify the

purchaser for

credit

losses

or

any

breach

of

certain 
representations and warranties made in connection

with the sale.
Servicing agreements

relating to

the mortgage-backed

securities

programs of

FNMA and

GNMA, and

to

mortgage loans

sold

or 
serviced to

certain other

investors, including

FHLMC, require

the Corporation

to

advance funds

to make

scheduled payments

of 
principal, interest, taxes

and insurance,

if such

payments have not

been received

from the

borrowers. At

December 31,

2024, the 
Corporation serviced $
9.0

billion in mortgage loans for third-parties, including the loans serviced with credit recourse (December 31, 
2023 - $
9.9

billion). The Corporation generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements from

the mortgage owner, 
from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage

loan is foreclosed or,

in the case of FHA/VA

loans, under the applicable FHA

and 
VA 
insurance

and guarantees

programs. However,

in the

meantime, the

Corporation must

absorb the

cost

of the

funds

it

advances 
during the

time the

advance is

outstanding. The

Corporation must

also bear

the costs

of attempting

to collect

on delinquent

and 
defaulted

mortgage

loans.

In

addition,

if

a

defaulted

loan

is

not

cured,

the

mortgage

loan

would

be

canceled

as

part

of

the 
foreclosure proceedings and the

Corporation would not

receive any future servicing

income

with respect to

that loan. At

December 
31,

2024,

the

outstanding

balance

of

funds

advanced

by

the

Corporation under

such

mortgage

loan

servicing

agreements

was 
approximately

$
44

million

(December

31,

2023

-

$
49

million).

To

the

extent

the

mortgage

loans

underlying

the

Corporation’s 
servicing portfolio experience

increased delinquencies, the Corporation

would be required

to dedicate additional

cash resources to 
comply with its obligation to advance funds as well

as incur additional administrative costs related

to increases in collection efforts.

Popular,

Inc. Holding

Company (“PIHC”) fully

and unconditionally guarantees

certain borrowing

obligations issued by

certain of

its 
100
% owned consolidated subsidiaries amounting to

$
94

million at both December 31,

2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
In addition, at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PIHC

fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a subordinated basis 
$
193

million of capital securities (trust preferred securities) issued by wholly-owned issuing trust entities to the extent set forth in the 
applicable

guarantee

agreement.

Note 23 – Commitments and contingencies 
Off-balance sheet risk 
The Corporation

is a

party to

financial instruments

with off-balance

sheet credit

risk in

the normal

course of

business to

meet the 
financial needs of its customers. These financial instruments

include loan commitments, letters of credit and standby

letters of credit. 
These instruments involve,

to varying

degrees, elements of

credit and

interest rate

risk in

excess of

the amount

recognized in

the 
consolidated statements of financial condition. 
The

Corporation’s

exposure

to

credit

loss

in

the

event

of

nonperformance

by

the

other

party

to

the

financial

instrument

for 
commitments to extend credit, standby

letters of credit and financial

guarantees is represented by the

contractual notional amounts 
of those instruments. The

Corporation uses the same

credit policies in

making these commitments and conditional

obligations as it 
does for those reflected on the consolidated statements

of financial condition. 
Financial instruments with

off-balance sheet credit

risk, whose contract

amounts represent potential credit

risk as of

the end of

the 
periods presented were as follows:

At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the

Corporation maintained a reserve of approximately $
15

million and $
17

million, 
respectively, for potential losses associated with unfunded loan commitments

related to commercial and construction lines

of credit. 
Other commitments 
At December

31, 2024

and December 31,

2023, the

Corporation also maintained

other non-credit

commitments for

approximately 
$
2.0

million and $
3.3

million, respectively, primarily for the acquisition of other investments.

Business concentration 
Since the Corporation’s business activities are concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, its results of operations and financial condition 
are dependent

upon the

general trends

of the

Puerto Rico

economy and,

in particular,

the residential

and commercial

real estate 
markets. The concentration

of the Corporation’s

operations in Puerto Rico

exposes it to

greater risk than other

banking companies 
with a wider geographic base. Its

asset and revenue composition by geographical area

is presented in Note 36

to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

Puerto

Rico

has

faced

significant

fiscal

and

economic

challenges

for

over

a

decade.

In

response

to

such

challenges,

the

U.S. 
Congress enacted the

Puerto Rico Oversight

Management and Economic Stability

Act (“PROMESA”) in

2016, which, among

other 
things,

established

the

Oversight

Board

and

a

framework

for

the

restructuring

of

the

debts

of

the

Commonwealth,

its 
instrumentalities

and

municipalities.

The

Commonwealth

and

several

of

its

instrumentalities

have

availed

themselves

of

debt 
restructuring proceedings

under PROMESA.

As

of the

date of

this report,

while municipalities

have been

designated as

covered 
entities under PROMESA, no municipality has commenced, or has been authorized by the Oversight Board to commence, any such 
debt restructuring proceeding under PROMESA. 
At December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s direct exposure to the

Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities 
totaled $
336

million, of which

$
336

million were outstanding

($
362

million and $
333

million at December

31, 2023). Of

the amount 
outstanding,

$
323

million

consists

of

loans

and

$
13

million

are

securities

($
314

million

and

$
19

million

at

December 31,

2023). 
Substantially all

of the

amount outstanding

at December

31, 2024

and December

31, 2023

were obligations

from various

Puerto 
Rico

municipalities.

In

most

cases,

these

were

“general

obligations”

of

a

municipality,

to

which

the

applicable

municipality

has 
pledged

its

good

faith,

credit

and

unlimited

taxing

power,

or

“special

obligations”

of

a

municipality,

to

which

the

applicable 
municipality

has

pledged

other

revenues.

At

December

31,

2024, 
80
%

of

the

Corporation’s

exposure

to

municipal

loans

and 

213 
securities

was

concentrated

in

the

municipalities

of

San

Juan,

Guaynabo,

Carolina

and

Caguas.
In

July

2024,

the

Corporation 
received scheduled principal payments amounting to $
40

million from various obligations from Puerto Rico

municipalities.

In

addition,

at

December

31,

2024,

the

Corporation

had

$
220

million

in

loans

insured

or

securities

issued

by

Puerto

Rico 
governmental entities

but for

which the

principal source

of repayment

is non-governmental

($
238

million at

December 31,

2023). 
These

included

$
176

million

in

residential

mortgage

loans

insured

by

the

Puerto

Rico

Housing

Finance

Authority

(“HFA”),

a 
governmental instrumentality that

has been

designated as a

covered entity under

PROMESA (December 31,

2023 -

$
191

million). 
These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA

insurance covers losses in 
the event

of a

borrower default

and upon

the satisfaction

of certain

other conditions.

The Corporation

also had

at December

31, 
2024, $
38

million in bonds

issued by HFA

which are secured by

second mortgage loans on

Puerto Rico residential properties,

and 
for which HFA

also provides insurance to

cover losses in

the event of

a borrower default

and upon the

satisfaction of certain

other 
conditions (December

31, 2023

- $
40

million). In

the event

that the

mortgage loans

insured by

HFA

and held

by the

Corporation 
directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA

bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the

outstanding balance of 
these loans, HFA’s

ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA

at the time such 
obligations

become

due

and

payable. The

Corporation does

not consider

the

government guarantee

when

estimating the

credit 
losses

associated

with

this

portfolio.

Although

the

Governor

is

currently

authorized

by

local

legislation

to

impose

a

temporary 
moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, a moratorium on

such obligations has not been imposed as of

the date hereof.

BPPR’s

commercial loan

portfolio also

includes loans

to

private borrowers

who

are service

providers, lessors,

suppliers or

have 
other relationships with the government. These

borrowers could be negatively affected by

the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis and

the 
ongoing

Title

III

proceedings

under

PROMESA.

Similarly,

BPPR’s

mortgage

and

consumer

loan

portfolios

include

loans

to 
government

employees

and

retirees,

which

could

also

be

negatively

affected

by

fiscal

measures

such

as

employee

layoffs

or 
furloughs or reductions in pension benefits.

In

addition,

$
2.1

billion

of

residential

mortgages

and

$
87.4

million

commercial

loans

were

insured

or

guaranteed

by

the

U.S. 
Government or its agencies at December 31, 2024 (compared to $
1.9

billion and $
89.2

million, respectively, at December 31, 2023). 
The Corporation also had

U.S. Treasury and

obligations from the U.S.

Government, its agencies or

government sponsored entities 
within the

portfolio of

available-for-sale and

held-to-maturity securities as

described in

Note 5

and 6

to the

Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
At December 31, 2024,

the Corporation had operations

in the United States

Virgin Islands (the

“USVI”) and had approximately

$
28
million

in

direct

exposure

to

USVI

government

entities

(December

31,

2023

-

$
28

million).

The

USVI

has

been

experiencing

a 
number of

fiscal and

economic challenges

that could

adversely affect

the ability

of its

public corporations

and instrumentalities

to 
service their outstanding debt obligations.

214 
At December 31,

2024, the Corporation

had operations in

the British Virgin

Islands (“BVI”) and

it had a

loan portfolio amounting

to 
approximately

$
196

million

comprised

of

various

retail

and

commercial

clients,

compared

to

a

loan

portfolio

of

$
205

million

at 
December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, the

Corporation had no significant exposure to a single

borrower in the BVI. 
FDIC Special Assessment

On

November

16,

2023,

the

Federal

Deposit

Insurance

Corporation

(“FDIC”)

approved

a

final

rule

that

imposes

a

special 
assessment (the “FDIC

Special Assessment”) to recover

the losses to

the deposit insurance

fund resulting from

the FDIC’s use,

in 
March 2023,

of the systemic

risk exception to

the least-cost resolution

test under the

Federal Deposit Insurance

Act in

connection 
with the

receiverships of

several failed

banks. In

connection with

this assessment,

the Corporation

recorded an

expense of

$
71.4
million, $
45.3

million net of tax, in the fourth quarter

of 2023, representing the full amount of the

assessment. 
During the first quarter of 2024, the Corporation recorded an additional expense of $
14.3

million, $
9.1

million net of tax, to reflect the 
FDIC's

higher

loss

estimate

which increased

from

$
16.3

billion,

when

approved,

to

$
20.4

billion

during the

quarter.

The

special 
assessment amount and collection period may

change as the estimated loss

is periodically adjusted or if

the total amount collected 
varies.
Legal Proceedings
The nature of Popular’s business ordinarily

generates claims, litigation,
arbitration, regulatory and governmental investigations, and 
legal

and

administrative

cases

and

proceedings

(collectively,

“Legal

Proceedings”).

Popular’s

Legal

Proceedings

may

involve 
various lines

of business

and include

claims relating

to contract,

torts, consumer

protection, securities,

antitrust, employment,

tax 
and

other

laws.

The

recovery

sought

in

Legal

Proceedings

may

include

substantial

or

indeterminate

compensatory

damages, 
punitive

damages,

injunctive

relief,

or

recovery

on

a

class-wide

basis.

When

the

Corporation

determines

that

it

has

meritorious 
defenses to the claims

asserted, it vigorously defends

itself. The Corporation will

consider the settlement of

cases (including cases 
where it has meritorious defenses) when, in management’s judgment,

it is in the best interest of the Corporation and

its stockholders 
to do so.

On at least

a quarterly basis,

Popular assesses its

liabilities and contingencies

relating to outstanding Legal

Proceedings 
utilizing the most current information available. For

matters where it is probable that the Corporation will

incur a material loss and the 
amount can be reasonably estimated, the Corporation establishes an accrual for

the loss. Once established, the accrual is

adjusted 
on at least a quarterly basis to reflect any relevant

developments, as appropriate. For matters where a material loss is not probable, 
or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably

estimated, no accrual is established.

In certain cases,

exposure to loss

exists in

excess of any

accrual to the

extent such loss

is reasonably possible,

but not

probable. 
Management believes and

estimates that the

range of reasonably

possible losses (with

respect to those

matters where such

limits 
may be determined in

excess of amounts accrued) for

current Legal Proceedings ranged from

$
0

to approximately $
5.95

million as 
of

December

31,

2024.

In

certain

cases,

management cannot

reasonably

estimate

the

possible

loss

at

this

time.

Any

estimate 
involves significant judgment, given the

varying stages of the

Legal Proceedings (including the fact

that many of them

are currently 
in preliminary stages), the

existence of multiple

defendants in several of

the current Legal Proceedings

whose share of liability

has 
yet to be determined, the numerous unresolved issues in

many of the Legal Proceedings, and the inherent uncertainty

of the various 
potential

outcomes

of

such

Legal

Proceedings.

Accordingly,

management’s

estimate

will

change

from

time-to-time,

and

actual 
losses may be more or less than the current estimate.

While the

outcome of

Legal Proceedings

is inherently

uncertain, based

on information

currently available,

advice of

counsel, and 
available

insurance

coverage,

management

believes

that

the

amount

it

has

already

accrued

is

adequate

and

any

incremental 
liability arising from

the Legal Proceedings

in matters in

which a loss

amount can be

reasonably estimated will not

have a material 
adverse effect

on the Corporation’s

consolidated financial position.

However, in

the event

of unexpected future

developments, it is 
possible that

the ultimate

resolution of

these matters

in a

reporting period, if

unfavorable, could have

a material

adverse effect

on 
the Corporation’s consolidated financial position for that period.

Set forth below is a description of certain Legal Proceedings. 
Insufficient Funds and Overdraft Fees Class Actions 

215 
Popular, Inc. (“Popular”) was named as

a defendant in a putative class action complaint captioned Golden v.

Popular, Inc. originally 
filed in March 2020

before the U.S. District Court for

the Southern District of New

York, seeking

damages, restitution and injunctive 
relief. Plaintiff alleged breach of

contract, violation of the covenant of

good faith and fair dealing,

unjust enrichment,

and violation of 
New York

consumer protection law due to Popular’s purported

practice of charging overdraft fees

(“OD Fees”)

on transactions that, 
under plaintiffs’ theory, do

not overdraw the account.
The complaint further alleged that Popular assessed OD Fees over authorized 
transactions for

which sufficient

funds are

held for

settlement. Following

a Motion

to Compel

Arbitration filed

by Popular,

Plaintiff 
filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal in April 2022.

In May 2022,

Plaintiff filed a

new complaint captioned Lipsett v.

Banco Popular North America

d/b/a Popular Community Bank

with 
the same allegations of

his previous complaint against

Popular. On May

2, 2024, the parties

reached a settlement in

principle on a 
class-wide basis. The Court approved the settlement

agreement on January 7, 2025. This matter is

now closed.

216 
Note 24 – Non-consolidated variable interest

entities
The Corporation is

involved with 
three

statutory trusts which

it created to

issue trust preferred

securities to the

public. These trusts 
are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) since the equity investors at risk have no substantial decision-making rights. The 
Corporation does not

hold any variable

interest in the

trusts, and therefore,

cannot be the

trusts’ primary beneficiary.

Furthermore, 
the

Corporation concluded

that

it did

not

hold

a

controlling financial

interest

in

these

trusts

since the

decisions

of

the

trusts

are 
predetermined through

the trust

documents and the

guarantee of

the trust

preferred securities is

irrelevant since

in substance

the 
sponsor is guaranteeing its own debt. 
Also, the

Corporation is

involved with

various special

purpose entities

mainly in

guaranteed mortgage

securitization transactions, 
including

GNMA

and

FNMA.

The

Corporation

has

also

engaged

in

securitization

transactions

with

FHLMC,

but

considers

its 
exposure in the

form of servicing

fees and servicing

advances not to be

significant at December

31, 2024.

These special purpose 
entities

are

deemed

to

be

VIEs

since

they

lack

equity

investments

at

risk.

The

Corporation’s

continuing

involvement

in

these 
guaranteed loan

securitizations includes

owning certain

beneficial interests in

the form

of securities as

well as

the servicing

rights 
retained. The Corporation is not required to provide additional financial support to

any of the variable interest entities to which it has 
transferred

the

financial

assets.

The

mortgage-backed

securities,

to

the

extent

retained,

are

classified

in

the

Corporation’s 
Consolidated

Statements

of

Financial

Condition

as

available-for-sale

or

trading

securities.

The

Corporation

concluded

that, 
essentially,

these

entities

(FNMA

and

GNMA)

control

the

design

of

their

respective

VIEs,

dictate

the

quality

and

nature

of

the 
collateral, require

the underlying

insurance, set

the servicing

standards via

the servicing

guides and

can change

them at

will, and 
can remove a

primary servicer with cause,

and without cause in

the case of

FNMA. Moreover, through

their guarantee obligations, 
agencies (FNMA and GNMA) have the obligation

to absorb losses that could be potentially significant

to the VIE. 
The

Corporation

holds

variable

interests

in

these

VIEs

in

the

form

of

agency

mortgage-backed

securities

and

collateralized 
mortgage obligations, including those securities originated by the Corporation and those acquired from

third parties. Additionally, the 
Corporation holds agency mortgage-backed securities

and agency collateralized mortgage obligations

issued by third party

VIEs in 
which

it

has

no

other

form

of

continuing

involvement.

Refer

to

Note

27

to

the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements

for

additional 
information

on

the

debt

securities

outstanding

at

December

31,

2024

and

2023,

which

are

classified

as

available-for-sale

and 
trading securities

in the

Corporation’s Consolidated

Statements of

Financial Condition.

In addition,

the Corporation

holds variable 
interests

in

the

form

of

servicing fees,

since

it

retains

the

right

to

service

the

transferred

loans

in

those

government-sponsored 
special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and

may also purchase the

right to service loans

in other government-sponsored SPEs that

were 
transferred to those SPEs by a third-party.

The following

table presents

the carrying

classification of

the assets

related to

the Corporation’s

variable interests

in 
non-consolidated VIEs

and the

maximum exposure

to loss

as a

result of

the Corporation’s

involvement as

servicer of

GNMA and 
FNMA loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The size of

the non-consolidated VIEs,

in which the

Corporation has a

variable interest in

the form

of servicing fees,

measured as 
the total unpaid principal balance of the loans,

amounted to $
6.6

billion at December 31, 2024 (December

31, 2023 - $
7.2

billion). 
The Corporation

determined that

the maximum

exposure to

loss includes

the fair

value of

the MSRs

and the

assumption that

the 
servicing advances

at December 31,

2024 and

2023 will

not be

recovered. The agency

debt securities are

not included as

part of 
the maximum exposure to loss since they are guaranteed

by the related agencies.
ASU 2009-17 requires that an ongoing primary beneficiary assessment should be made to determine whether the Corporation is the 
primary beneficiary of any of the VIEs it is

involved with. The conclusion on the assessment of these non-consolidated VIEs has not 
changed

since

their

initial

evaluation.

The

Corporation

concluded

that

it

is

still

not

the

primary

beneficiary

of

these

VIEs,

and 
therefore, these VIEs are not required to be consolidated

in the Corporation’s financial statements at December 31,

2024.

218 
Note 25 – Derivative instruments and hedging

activities 
The

use

of

derivatives

is

incorporated

as

part

of

the

Corporation’s

overall

interest

rate

risk

management

strategy

to

minimize 
significant unplanned fluctuations in

earnings and cash flows

that are caused

by interest rate volatility.

The Corporation’s goal

is to 
manage interest

rate sensitivity by

modifying the repricing

or maturity characteristics

of certain

balance sheet assets

and liabilities 
so

that the

net interest

income is

not materially

affected

by movements

in interest

rates. The

Corporation uses

derivatives in

its 
trading activities

to facilitate

customer transactions,

and as

a means

of risk

management. As

a result

of interest

rate fluctuations, 
hedged fixed and

variable interest rate

assets and liabilities

will appreciate or

depreciate in fair

value. The effect

of this

unrealized 
appreciation or depreciation is expected to be

substantially offset by the Corporation’s

gains or losses on the derivative instruments 
that are linked to these hedged assets and liabilities. As a matter of policy,

the Corporation does not use highly leveraged derivative 
instruments for interest rate risk management.

The credit

risk attributed to

the counterparty’s

nonperformance risk is

incorporated in the

fair value

of the

derivatives. Additionally, 
the

fair value

of

the

Corporation’s own

credit

standing is

considered in

the fair

value

of the

derivative liabilities.

During the

year 
ended December 31,

2024, inclusion of

the credit risk

in the

fair value of

the derivatives resulted

in a

gain of

$
0.1

million from the 
Corporation’s credit standing adjustment.

During the years ended December 31, 2023 and

2022, the Corporation recognized a gain 
of $
0.4

million and a loss of $
0.5

million, respectively, from the Corporation’s credit standing adjustment. 
The Corporation’s derivatives are subject to agreements which allow a right of set-off with each respective counterparty.

In an event 
of default, each party has a right of set-off

against the other party for amounts owed in the related agreement and any other amount 
or obligation owed in respect of any

other agreement or transaction between them. 
Pursuant to the Corporation’s accounting policy, 
the

fair

value

of

derivatives

is

not

offset

with

the

fair

value

of

other

derivatives

held

with

the

same

counterparty

even

if

these 
agreements allow

a right

of set-off.

In

addition,

the fair

value of

derivatives is

not offset

with the

amounts for

the right

to

reclaim 
financial collateral or the obligation to return financial

collateral.

Cash Flow Hedges 
The Corporation

utilizes forward

contracts to

hedge the

sale

of mortgage-backed

securities with

duration terms

over one

month. 
Interest rate forwards are contracts for the delayed delivery of securities,

which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date 
at

a specified

price or

yield.

These forward

contracts are

hedging a

forecasted transaction

and thus

qualify for

cash flow

hedge 
accounting.

Changes

in

the

fair

value

of

these

forward

contracts

designated

as

cash

flow

hedges

are

recorded

in

other 
comprehensive income (loss). 
Effective on

January 1,

2023, the

Corporation discontinued

the hedge

accounting treatment

of certain

forward contracts

for which 
the

changes

in

fair

value

were

recorded,

net

of

taxes,

in

accumulated

other

comprehensive

income

(loss)

and

subsequently 
reclassified to net

income (loss) in

the same

period that the

hedged transaction impacted

earnings. As a

result of this

change, the 
changes in the fair value of these forward contracts

are being recorded through net income. At December 31, 2024 and 2023,

there 
were no derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

For cash flow hedges, net gains (losses) on derivative

contracts that are reclassified from accumulated other

comprehensive income 
(loss) to current period earnings are included in the line item

in which the hedged item is recorded and during

the period in which the 
forecasted transaction impacts earnings, as presented

in the tables below.

Forward Contracts 
The Corporation has forward contracts to sell

activities. 
Interest Rate Caps

The

Corporation enters

into

interest rate

caps as

an intermediary

on

behalf of

its customers

and simultaneously

takes offsetting 
positions under the same terms and conditions, thus

minimizing its market and credit risks. 
Indexed and Embedded Options 
The Corporation offers certain customers’ deposits whose

return are tied to the performance of the Standard

and Poor’s (“S&P 500”) 
stock

market

indexes,

and

other

deposits

whose

returns

are

tied

to

other

stock

market

indexes

or

other

equity

securities 
performance. The

Corporation bifurcated the

related options embedded

within these

customers’ deposits from

the host

contract in 
accordance with

ASC Subtopic

815-15. In

order to

limit the

Corporation’s exposure

to changes

in these

indexes, the

Corporation 
purchases indexed options which

returns are tied to

the same indexes from

major broker dealer companies

in the over the

counter 
market. Accordingly, the embedded options and the related indexed options are

marked-to-market through earnings.

221 
Note 26 – Related party transactions
The Corporation has had loan transactions with

the Corporation’s directors, executive officers, including certain

related individuals or 
organizations, and affiliates, and

proposes to continue such

transactions in the ordinary

course of its business,

on substantially the 
same

terms,

including

Related party transactions with Evertec,

as an affiliate 
Until

August

15,

2022,

the

Corporation

had

an

investment

in

Evertec,

Inc.

(“Evertec”)

which

provides

various

processing

and 
information

technology services

to

the

Corporation and

its

subsidiaries

and

gave

BPPR

access to

the

ATH

network owned

and 
operated

by

Evertec.

This

investment

was

accounted

for

under

the

equity

method.

The

Corporation

recorded

$
1.5

million

in 
dividends from its investment in Evertec during

the year ended December 31, 2022. 
On July 1, 2022, BPPR completed its previously announced

acquisition of certain assets from Evertec Group,

LLC (“Evertec Group”) 
to

service

certain

BPPR

channels,

in

exchange

for

shares

of

Evertec

held

by

BPPR.

The

transaction

was

accounted

for

as

a 
business combination. In

connection with this

transaction, BPPR also

entered into amended

and restated service

agreements with 
Evertec Group pursuant to

which Evertec Group will continue

to provide various information technology

and transaction processing 
services to Popular,

BPPR and their

respective subsidiaries. As

part of the

transaction, BPPR and

Evertec entered into

a revenue 
sharing structure for BPPR in connection with its merchant acquiring relationship with Evertec. On August 15, 2022, the Corporation 
completed the sale of

its remaining shares of common

stock of Evertec, together with

the aforementioned business acquisition (the 
“Evertec Transactions”). As

a result, the

Corporation discontinued accounting for

its proportionate share

of Evertec’s

income (loss) 
and changes in stockholder’s equity under the equity method of accounting in

the third quarter of 2022. The Corporation recorded a 
pre-tax gain of $
257.7

million considering the initial exchange of

Evertec shares as well as the sale of

the remaining shares.
The following

Note 27 – Fair value measurement

ASC Subtopic

820-10 “Fair

Value

Measurements and

Disclosures” establishes

a fair

value hierarchy

that prioritizes

the inputs

to 
valuation techniques

used to

measure fair

value into

three levels

in order

to increase

consistency and

comparability in

fair value 
measurements and disclosures. The hierarchy is broken

down into three levels based on the reliability

of inputs as follows: 
●
Level 1 
- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to 
access at

the measurement date.

Valuation

on these

instruments does not

necessitate a

significant degree of

judgment 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that

are readily available in an active market. 
●
Level 2 
- Quoted prices other than those included in Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly.

Level 2 inputs 
include

quoted

prices

for

similar

assets

or

liabilities

in

active

markets,

quoted

prices

for

identical

or

similar

assets

or 
liabilities in

markets that

are

not active,

or other

inputs that

are

observable or

that can

be corroborated

by

observable 
market data for substantially the full term of the

financial instrument. 
●
Level

3 
-

Inputs

are

unobservable

and

significant

to

the

fair

value

measurement.

Unobservable

inputs

reflect

the 
Corporation’s own judgements about assumptions that

market participants would use in pricing the asset

or liability. 
The

Corporation

maximizes

the

use

of

observable

inputs

and

minimizes

the

use

of

unobservable

inputs

by

requiring

that

the 
observable inputs be used when

available. Fair value is

based upon quoted market prices

when available. If listed prices

or quotes 
are

not

available,

the

Corporation

employs

internally-developed

models

that

primarily

use

market-based

inputs

including

yield 
curves, interest rates,

volatilities, and credit

curves, among others.

Valuation

adjustments are limited

to those necessary

to ensure 
that the financial instrument’s

fair value is adequately representative of

the price that would

be received or paid

in the marketplace. 
These adjustments include amounts that reflect counterparty credit quality,

the Corporation’s credit standing, constraints on liquidity 
and unobservable parameters that are applied consistently.

The estimated fair

value may

be subjective in

nature and may

involve uncertainties and

matters of

significant judgment for

certain 
financial instruments. Changes in the underlying assumptions

used in calculating fair value could significantly

affect the results.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the Corporation has elected the fair value option for

newly originated mortgage loans held-for-
sale. This election better aligns with the management

of the portfolio from a business perspective.

Loans held-for-sale measured at fair value 

Loans held-for-sale measured at fair value were priced

based on secondary market prices. These loans

are classified as Level 2. 
The

following

tables summarize

the difference

between the

aggregate fair

value

and the

aggregate unpaid

principal

balance

for 
mortgage loans originated as held-for-sale measured

at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and

December 31, 2023.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s collateralized mortgage obligations and 
interest-only

collateralized

mortgage

obligation

(reported

as

“other”),

which

are

classified

in

the

“trading”

category,

are

yield, 
constant

prepayment rate,

and

weighted average

life. Significant

increases (decreases)

in

any

of

those

inputs in

isolation would 
result

in

significantly

lower

(higher)

fair

value

measurement.

Generally,

a

change

in

the

assumption

used

for

the

constant 
prepayment

rate

will

generate

a

directionally

opposite

change

in

the

weighted

average

life.

For

example,

as

the

average life

is 
reduced

by

a

higher

constant

prepayment

rate,

a

lower

yield

will

be

realized,

and

when

there

is

a

reduction

in

the

constant 
prepayment

rate,

the

average

life

of

these

collateralized

mortgage

obligations

will

extend,

thus

resulting

in

a

higher

yield.

The 
significant

unobservable

inputs

used

in

the

fair

value

measurement

of

the

Corporation’s

mortgage

servicing

rights

are

constant 
prepayment rates and discount rates.

Increases in interest rates may result in lower prepayments. Discount rates vary

according to 
products and / or portfolios depending on the

perceived risk. Increases in discount rates result

in a lower fair value measurement.
Following is

a description

of the

Corporation’s valuation

methodologies used

for assets

and liabilities

measured at

fair value.

The 
disclosure requirements exclude certain financial instruments and all

non-financial instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value 
amounts of the financial instruments disclosed do

not represent management’s estimate of the underlying

value of the Corporation.

maturity treasury curve.

These securities are classified

as Level 2.

U.S. Treasury

bills are classified as

Level 1 given the 
high volume of trades and pricing based on those

trades.

●

Obligations of U.S.

Government sponsored entities: The

Obligations of U.S. Government

sponsored entities include U.S. 
agency

securities,

which

fair

value

is

based

on

an

active

exchange

market

and

on

quoted

market

prices

for

similar 
securities. The U.S. agency securities are classified as

Level 2.

●

Obligations of Puerto

Rico, States and

political subdivisions: Obligations of

Puerto Rico, States

and political subdivisions 
include

municipal

bonds.

The

bonds

are

segregated

and

the

like

characteristics

divided

into

specific

sectors.

Market 
inputs used in the

evaluation process include all or

some of the following:

trades, bid price or

spread, two sided markets, 
quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to Treasury

benchmarks and swap curves, market data feeds such as 
those obtained from

municipal market sources,

discount and capital

rates, and

trustee reports. The

municipal bonds are 
classified as Level 2. 
●

Mortgage-backed securities: Certain agency mortgage-backed

securities (“MBS”) are priced based on a bond’s theoretical 
value

derived

from

similar

bonds

defined

by

credit

quality

and

market

sector.

Their

fair

value

incorporates

an

option 
adjusted spread. The

agency MBS are classified

as Level 2.

Other agency MBS

such as GNMA

Puerto Rico Serials

are 
priced using an internally-prepared pricing matrix with quoted prices from local brokers dealers. These particular MBS are 
classified as Level 3. 
●

Collateralized mortgage

obligations: Agency

collateralized mortgage

obligations (“CMOs”)

are priced

based on

a bond’s 
theoretical

value

derived

from

similar

bonds

defined

by

credit

quality

and

market

sector

and

for

which

fair

value 
incorporates

an

option

adjusted

spread.

The

option

adjusted

spread

model

includes

prepayment

and

volatility 
assumptions,

ratings

(whole

loans

collateral)

and

spread

adjustments.

These

CMOs

are

classified

as

Level

2.

Other 

230 
CMOs, due

to their

limited liquidity,

are classified

as Level

3 due

to the

insufficiency of

inputs such

as executed

trades, 
credit information and cash flows.

●

Corporate securities (included

as “other” in

the “available-for-sale” category):

Given that the

quoted prices are

for similar 
instruments, these securities are classified as Level

2.

●

Corporate securities

and

interest-only strips

(included as

“other” in

the

“trading account

debt securities”

category): For 
corporate securities, quoted prices for these security types are obtained from broker dealers. Given that the quoted prices 
are for similar instruments or do not trade in highly liquid

markets, these securities are classified as Level 2. Given

that the 
fair

value

was

estimated

based

on

a

discounted

cash

flow

model

using

unobservable

inputs,

interest-only

strips

are 
classified as Level 3.

Equity securities 
Equity

securities

are

comprised principally

of

shares

in

closed-ended and

open-ended mutual

funds

and

other

equity

securities. 
Closed-end funds are

traded on the

secondary market at

the shares’ market value.

Open-ended funds are considered

to be liquid, 
as investors can sell their shares continually to the fund and are priced at NAV.

Mutual funds are classified as Level 2. Other equity 
securities that

do not

trade in

highly liquid

markets are

also classified

as Level

2, except

for one

equity security

that do

not have 
readily determinable fair value and is under an investment

company is measured at NAV. 
Mortgage servicing rights

Mortgage

servicing

rights

(“MSRs”)

do

not

trade

in

an

active

market

with

readily

observable

prices.

MSRs

are

priced

using

a 
discounted cash

flow model

valuation performed

by a

third party.

The discounted

cash flow

model incorporates

assumptions that 
market

participants

would

use

in

estimating

future

net

servicing

income,

including

portfolio

characteristics,

prepayments 
assumptions, discount

rates, delinquency

and foreclosure

rates, late

charges, other

ancillary revenues,

cost to

service and

other 
economic factors.

Prepayment speeds

are adjusted

for the

loans’ characteristics

and portfolio

behavior.

Due to

the unobservable 
nature of certain valuation inputs, the MSRs are

classified as Level 3.

Derivatives

Interest

rate

caps

and

indexed

options

are

traded

in

over-the-counter

active

markets.

These

derivatives

are

indexed

to

an 
observable interest rate benchmark, such

as LIBOR or equity indexes,

and are priced using an

income approach based on present 
value

and

option

pricing

models

using

observable

inputs.

Other

derivatives

are

liquid

and

have

quoted

prices,

such

as

forward 
contracts or

“to be

announced securities”

(“TBAs”). All

of these

derivatives are

classified as

Level 2.

The non-performance

risk is 
determined using internally-developed models that

consider the collateral

held, the remaining

term, and the

creditworthiness of the 
entity that

bears the

risk, and

uses available

public data

or internally-developed

data related

to current

spreads that

denote their 
probability of default. 
Contingent consideration liability 
The

fair

value

of

the

contingent consideration,

which

was

related

to

earnout

payments

that

could

be

payable

over

a

three-year 
period to K2 Capital Group LLC’s

(“K2”) related to an equipment leasing

and financing business acquired by the Corporation

during 
the

year

2022,

was

calculated

based

on

a

discounted

cash

flow

technique

using

the

probability-weighted

average

from

likely 
scenarios.

This contingent consideration is classified as Level

3. 
Loans held-in-portfolio that are collateral dependent 
The impairment is

measured based on

the fair value

of the collateral,

which is derived

from appraisals that

take into consideration 
prices

in

observed

transactions

involving

similar

assets

in

similar

locations

and

which

could

be

subject

to

internal

adjustments. 
These collateral dependent loans are classified as Level

3.

Loans measured at fair value or measured at

the lower of cost or market 
Loans

held-for-sale measured

at fair

value

or measured

at the

lower of

cost

or market

were priced

based

on secondary

market 
prices. These loans are classified as Level 2.

Other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets

Other

real

estate

owned

includes

real

estate

properties

securing

mortgage,

consumer,

and

commercial

loans.

Other

foreclosed 
assets include primarily automobiles

securing auto loans. The

fair value of

foreclosed assets may be

determined using an external 

231 
appraisal, broker price opinion, or an

internal valuation.

These foreclosed assets are classified as Level

3 since they are subject

to 
internal adjustments. 
ROU assets and leasehold improvements 
The impairment was measured based on the sublease rental value of

the branches that were subject to the strategic

realignment of 
PB’s New York Metro Branch network.

These ROU assets and leasehold improvements are

classified as Level 3. 
Long-lived assets held-for-sale 
The

Corporation

evaluates

for

impairment

its

long-lived

assets,

whenever

events

or

changes

in

circumstances

indicate

that

the 
carrying amount of

an asset may not

be recoverable and records

a write down for

the difference between the

carrying amount and 
the fair value less cost to sell. These long-lived

assets held-for-sale are classified as Level

3. 
Trademark 
The write-down on impairment of a trademark

was based on the discontinuance of origination

thru e-loan platform. This trademark is 
classified as Level 3.

232 
Note 28 – Fair value of financial instruments
The fair

value of

financial instruments

is the

amount at

which an

asset or

obligation could

be exchanged

in a

current transaction 
between

willing

parties,

other

than

in

a

forced

or

liquidation

sale.

For

those

financial

instruments

with

no

quoted

market

prices 
available, fair values have been estimated using present

value calculations or other valuation techniques, as well

as management’s 
best judgment with respect to current economic conditions, including discount rates, estimates of future cash flows, and prepayment 
assumptions. Many of these

estimates involve various assumptions and

may vary significantly from

amounts that could be

realized 
in actual transactions. 
The

fair

values

reflected

herein

have

been

determined

based

on

the

prevailing

rate

environment

at

December

31,

2024

and 
December 31, 2023, as

applicable. In different interest

rate environments, fair value

estimates can differ significantly,

especially for 
certain

fixed

rate

financial

instruments.

In

addition,

the

fair

values

presented

do

not

attempt

to

estimate

the

value

of

the 
Corporation’s fee

generating businesses and

anticipated future business

activities, that

is, they

do not

represent the

Corporation’s 
value as

a going concern.

There have been

no changes in

the Corporation’s valuation

methodologies and inputs

used to estimate 
the fair values for each class of financial assets and

liabilities not measured at fair value. 
The following tables present the

carrying amount and estimated fair

values of financial instruments with their

corresponding level in 
the fair

value hierarchy.

The aggregate

fair value

amounts of

the financial

instruments disclosed

do not

represent management’s 
estimate of the underlying value of the Corporation.

Note 29 – Employee benefits 
Certain employees of BPPR are covered by three

non-contributory defined benefit pension plans,

the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 
Retirement Plan and two Restoration Plans (the

“Pension Plans”).

Pension benefits are based on age, years of

credited service, 
and final average compensation. 
The Pension

Plans are

currently closed to

new hires

and the

accrual of

benefits are

frozen to

all participants. The

Pension Plans’ 
benefit formula

is based

on a

percentage of

average final

compensation and

years of

service as

of the

plan freeze

date. Normal 
retirement age under

the retirement plan

is age 65

with 5 years

of service. Pension

costs are funded

in accordance with

minimum 
funding standards

under the

Employee Retirement

Income Security

Act of

1974 (“ERISA”).

Benefits under

the Pension

Plans are 
subject to

the U.S.

and Puerto

Rico Internal Revenue

Code limits

on compensation

and benefits.

Benefits under restoration

plans 
restore benefits

to selected

employees that are

limited under

the Banco

Popular de

Puerto Rico

Retirement Plan

due to

U.S. and 
Puerto Rico

Internal Revenue

Code limits

and a

compensation definition

that excludes

amounts deferred pursuant

to nonqualified 
arrangements.

In

addition

to

providing

pension

benefits,

BPPR

provides

certain

health

care

benefits

for

certain

retired

employees

(the

“OPEB 
Plan”).

Regular employees

of BPPR,

hired before

February 1,

2000, may

become eligible

for health

care benefits,

provided they 
reach retirement age while working for BPPR. 
The

Corporation’s

funding

policy is

to

make

annual contributions

to

the

Pension Plans,

when necessary,

in amounts

which fully 
provide for all benefits as they become due under

the plans.

The Corporation’s pension fund investment strategy

is to invest in a

prudent manner for the exclusive

purpose of providing benefits 
to participants. A well defined internal structure has

been established to develop and implement

a risk-controlled investment strategy 
that is targeted to

produce a total return that,

when combined with BPPR contributions to

the fund, will maintain the

fund’s ability to 
meet all

required benefit obligations.

Risk is controlled

through diversification of

asset types, such

as investments in

domestic and 
international equities and fixed income. 
Equity investments include various types of stock and index funds. Also, this category

includes Popular, Inc.’s common stock. Fixed 
income

investments include

U.S. Government

securities

and

other U.S.

agencies’ obligations,

corporate

bonds, mortgage

loans, 
mortgage-backed securities

and index

funds, among

others. A

designated committee

periodically reviews

the performance

of the 
pension

plans’

investments

and

assets

allocation.

The

Trustee

and

the

money

managers

are

allowed

to

exercise

investment 
discretion, subject

to limitations

established by

the pension

plans’ investment

policies. The

plans forbid

money managers

to enter 
into derivative transactions, unless approved by the

Trustee.

The

overall

expected

long-term

rate-of-return-on-assets assumption

reflects

the

average rate

of

earnings

expected

on

the funds 
invested or

to

be invested

to provide

for the

benefits included

in the

benefit obligation.

The assumption

has been

determined by 
reflecting

expectations

regarding

future

rates

of

return

for

the

plan

assets,

with

consideration

given

to

the

distribution

of

the 
investments by asset

class and

historical rates of

return for each

individual asset class.

This process is

reevaluated at least

The closing prices reported in the active markets

in which the securities are traded are used

to value the investments.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies

used for investments measured at fair value: 
●

Obligations

of

U.S.

Government,

its

agencies,

states

and

political

subdivisions

-

The

fair

value

of

Obligations

of

U.S. 
Government and its agencies obligations are based on

an active exchange market and on quoted market prices

for similar 
securities. U.S.

agency structured

notes

are

priced based

on

a bond’s

theoretical value

from similar

bonds

defined by 
credit quality

and market sector

and for

which the

fair value

incorporates an

option adjusted spread

in deriving

their fair 
value.

The fair value

of municipal bonds

are based on

trade data on

these instruments reported on

Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”)

transaction reporting system

or comparable bonds

from the same

issuer and credit

quality.

These securities are classified as Level 2, except for

the governmental index funds that are measured

at NAV. 
●

Corporate bonds and debentures -

Corporate bonds and debentures are

valued at fair value at

the closing price reported 
in the active market in

which the bond is traded. These

securities are classified as Level

2, except for the 
c
orporate bond 
funds that are measured at NAV. 
●

Equity securities – common stock

- Equity securities with

quoted market prices obtained from

an active exchange market 
and high liquidity are classified as Level 1. 
●

Equity securities – ETF’s

– Exchange Traded Funds

shares with quoted market prices

obtained from an active exchange 
market. Highly liquid ETF’s are classified as Level 1 while

less liquid ETF’s are classified as Level 2.

●

Foreign commingled trust fund-

Collective investment funds that are

valued using the NAV

per share practical expedient, 
were not

categorized within

the fair

value

hierarchy and

were presented

separately.

The Fund's

investments are

in an 
international equity portfolio and in an emerging markets

equity fund. 
●

Mutual

funds

–

Mutual

funds

held

by

the

Plan

are

open-end

mutual

funds

that

are

registered

with

the

Securities

and 
Exchange

Commission (SEC)

and are

required to

publish their

daily NAV.

Since these

funds

have liquid

markets with 
trading activity of these or similar securities they

are considered level 2. 
●

Cash and cash equivalents - The carrying amount of

cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of the

fair value 
since it is available on demand or due

to their short-term maturity. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level

1. 
●

Accrued investment income – Given the

short-term nature of these assets, their carrying

amount approximates fair value. 
Since there is a lack of observable inputs

related to instrument specific attributes,

these are reported as Level 3. 
The preceding valuation methods may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or

reflective 
of future fair values. Furthermore, although the plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market 
participants, the

use

of

different

methodologies

or

assumptions to

determine

the

fair value

of

certain financial

instruments could 
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting

date.

For 2024, the significant component of the Pension Plans

actuarial gain were mainly related to an decrease in the

obligation due to an increase in the 
single weighted-average discount rates and a change to certain

demographic assumptions partially offset by a lower

return on the fair value of plan 
assets.

For OPEB plans, significant components of the actuarial

gain that changed the benefit obligation were mainly

related to the per capita 
assumption at year end that improved the funded position,

a change to certain demographic assumptions, a favorable

demographic experience from 
larger than expected reductions and an increase in discount

rates. For 2023, the significant component of the Pension

Plans actuarial loss were 
mainly related to a higher return on the fair value of plan

assets partially offset by an increase in the obligation

due to a decrease in the single 
weighted-average discount rates.

For OPEB plans, significant components of the actuarial

gain that changed the benefit obligation were mainly 
related to the per capita assumption at year end that

improved the funded position and the gain associated

with census data updates and plan 
experience better than expected offset by the

decrease in discount rates.

Potential common shares consist of shares of common stock issuable under the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock 
and

performance

share

awards

using

the

treasury

stock

method.

This

method

assumes

that

the

potential

common

shares

are 
issued and

the proceeds

from exercise,

in addition

to the

amount of

compensation cost

attributed to

future services,

are used

to 
purchase shares of common stock at the exercise date. The difference between the number of potential common shares issued and 
the shares

of common

stock

purchased is

added as

incremental shares

to

the actual

number of

shares outstanding

to

compute 
diluted

earnings

per

share.

Warrants,

stock

options,

restricted

stock

and

performance share

awards,

if

any,

that

result

in

lower 
potential common shares

issued than shares

of common stock

purchased under the treasury

stock method are

not included in

the 
computation of dilutive earnings per share

since their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect in earnings

per common share.

[1] Effective in the third quarter of 2024, the

Corporation reclassified certain interchange fees, which

were previously included jointly with credit card 
fees from common network activity,

as debit card fees. For the year ended December 31, 2024,

these interchange fees were approximately $
45.5
million, which include approximately $
22.2

million corresponding to the first and second quarters

of 2024 which were reclassified. For the years 
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, interchange fees

of approximately $
45.3

and

$
43.3

million were reclassified, respectively. 
[2] The amounts include intersegment transactions of $
4.5

million, $
5
.0 million and $
5
.0 million, respectively, for the

years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022.
Revenue from contracts with

customers is recognized when,

or as, the performance

obligations are satisfied by

the Corporation by 
transferring the

promised services

to

the customers.

A

service is

transferred to

the customer

when, or

as, the

customer obtains 
control

of

that

service.

A

performance obligation

may

be

satisfied over

time

or

at

a

point

in

time.

Revenue from

a

performance 
obligation satisfied

over time

is recognized

based on

the services

that have

been rendered

to date.

Revenue from

a performance 
obligation satisfied at a point in time

is recognized when the customer obtains control over the

service. The transaction price, or the 
amount of revenue

recognized, reflects the

consideration the Corporation expects

to be entitled

to in exchange

for those promised 
services. In determining the transaction price, the Corporation considers the effects of variable consideration. Variable consideration 
is included

in the

transaction price

only to

the extent

it is

probable that a

significant reversal

in the

amount of

cumulative revenue 
recognized will

not occur.

The Corporation

is the

principal in

a transaction

if it

obtains control

of the

specified goods

or services 
before they

are transferred

to

the customer.

If the

Corporation acts

as principal,

revenues are

presented in

the gross

amount of 
consideration to which it expects to

be entitled and are not

netted with any related expenses. On the

other hand, the Corporation is 
an agent if it does not control

the specified goods or services before they are transferred

to the customer. If

the Corporation acts as 
an agent, revenues are presented in the amount

of consideration to which it expects to be entitled,

net of related expenses. 
Following is a description of the nature and timing

of revenue streams from contracts with customers:
Service charges on deposit accounts 
Service

charges

on

deposit

accounts

are

earned

on

retail

and

commercial

deposit

activities

and

include,

but

are

not

limited

to, 
nonsufficient fund

fees, overdraft

fees and

checks stop

payment fees.

These transaction-based

fees are

recognized at

a point

in 
time,

upon

occurrence

of

an

activity

or

event

or

upon

the

occurrence

of

a

condition

which

triggers

the

fee

assessment.

The 
Corporation is acting as principal in these transactions. 
Debit card fees 
Debit card fees include, but are not limited to, interchange

fees, surcharging income and foreign transaction

fees.

These transaction-
based fees

are recognized at

a point in

time, upon

occurrence of an

activity or

event or upon

the occurrence of

a condition which 
triggers

the

fee

assessment.

Interchange

fees

are

recognized

upon

settlement

of

the

debit

card

payment

transactions.

The 
Corporation is acting as principal in these transactions. 
Insurance fees 

245 
Insurance fees

include, but

are

not limited

to, commissions

and contingent

commissions.

Commissions and

fees

are

recognized 
when related

policies are effective

since the Corporation

does not

have an enforceable

right to

payment for services

completed to 
date.

An

allowance

is

created

for

expected

adjustments

to

commissions

earned

related

to

policy

cancellations.

Contingent 
commissions

are

recorded

on

an

accrual

basis

when

the

amount

to

be

received

is

notified

by

the

insurance

company.

The 
Corporation is acting

as an

agent since it

arranges for the

sale of

the policies and

receives commissions if,

and when, it

achieves 
the sale.

Credit card fees 
Credit card

fees include,

but are

not limited

to, interchange

fees, additional

card fees,

cash advance

fees, balance

transfer fees, 
foreign transaction fees, and returned payments

fees. Credit card fees are

recognized at a point in

time, upon the occurrence of an 
activity or

an event.

Interchange fees

are recognized

upon settlement

of the

credit card

payment transactions. The

Corporation is 
acting as principal in these transactions. 
Sale and administration of investment products 
Fees from

the sale

and administration

of investment

products include,

but are

not limited

to, commission

income from

the sale

of 
investment products, asset management fees, underwriting

fees, and mutual fund fees.

Commission income from investment products is recognized on the trade date since clearing, trade execution, and custody services 
are satisfied when

the customer acquires

or disposes of

the rights to

obtain the economic

benefits of the

investment products and 
brokerage contracts have no fixed duration and

are terminable at will by

either party. The

Corporation is acting as principal in these 
transactions since it

performs the service

of providing the

customer with the

ability to acquire

or dispose of

the rights to

obtain the 
economic benefits of investment products.

Asset

management

fees

are

satisfied

over

time

and

are

recognized

in

arrears.

At

contract

inception,

the

estimate

of

the

asset 
management fee

is constrained

from the

inclusion in

the transaction

price since

the promised

consideration is

dependent on

the 
market and thus

is highly susceptible

to factors

outside the manager’s

influence. As advisor,

the broker-dealer subsidiary

is acting 
as principal. 
Underwriting fees are

recognized at a point

in time, when

the investment products

are sold in

the open market at

a markup. When 
the broker-dealer subsidiary is lead

underwriter, it is

acting as an agent. In

turn, when it is

a participating underwriter, it

is acting as 
principal. 
Mutual fund fees,

such as distribution fees,

are considered variable consideration

and are recognized over

time, as the

uncertainty 
of the fees to be

received is resolved as NAV

is determined and investor activity occurs. The

promise to provide distribution-related 
services

is

considered

a

single

performance

obligation

as

it

requires

the

provision

of

a

series

of

distinct

services

that

are 
substantially the same and have the same pattern of

transfer. When the broker-dealer subsidiary is acting as a distributor, it is acting 
as principal. In turn, when it acts as third-party dealer, it is acting

as an agent. 
Trust fees 
Trust fees

are recognized from

retirement plan, mutual fund

administration, investment management, trustee, escrow,

and custody 
and

safekeeping services.

These

asset

management services

are

considered

a

single

performance obligation

as

it

requires the 
provision of

a series

of distinct

services that

are substantially

the same

and have

the same

pattern of

transfer.

The performance 
obligation

is

satisfied

over

time,

except

for

optional

services

and

certain

other

services

that

are

satisfied

at

a

point

in

time.

Revenues are recognized in

arrears,

when, or as,

the services are rendered.

The Corporation is

acting as principal since,

as asset 
manager, it has the obligation to provide the specified service to the customer and

has the ultimate discretion in establishing the fee 
paid by the customer for the specified services.

246 
Note 32 – Leases 
The

Corporation enters

in

the

ordinary course

of

business

into

operating and

finance

leases

for

land,

buildings

and

equipment. 
These contracts generally do

not include purchase options

or residual value guarantees.

The remaining lease terms

of 
0.2

to 
30.0
years

considers options

to

extend the

leases for

up

to 
20

years. The

Corporation identifies

leases when

it

has

both the

right to 
obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from

the use of the asset and the right to direct

the use of the asset. 
The Corporation

recognizes right-of-use

assets (“ROU

assets”) and

lease liabilities

related to

operating and

finance leases

in its 
Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition under the caption of other assets and other liabilities, respectively. Refer to Note 13 
and

Note

18

to

the

Consolidated Financial

Statements,

respectively,

for

information

on

the

balances of

these

lease

assets

and 
liabilities. 
The Corporation uses the

incremental borrowing rate for

purposes of discounting lease payments

for operating and finance leases, 
since it

does not have

enough information to

determine the rates

implicit in the

leases. The discount

rates are based

on fixed-rate 
and

fully

amortizing

borrowing

facilities

of

its

banking

subsidiaries

that

are

collateralized.

For

leases

held

by

non-banking 
subsidiaries, a credit spread is added to this rate

based on financing transactions with a

similar credit risk profile.

cash flows of operating and finance leases for

Note 33 - Stock-based compensation
Incentive Plan 

On May 12, 2020, the shareholders of the Corporation approved the Popular, Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which permits 
the Corporation to issue several types of stock-based compensation to employees and directors of

the Corporation and/or any of its 
subsidiaries (the

“2020 Incentive

Plan”). The

2020 Incentive

Plan replaced

the Popular,

Inc. 2004

Omnibus Incentive

Plan, which 
was in effect

prior to the adoption of

the 2020 Incentive Plan (the

“2004 Incentive Plan” and, together

with the 2020 Incentive

Plan, 
the “Incentive Plan”). Participants under the Incentive Plan are designated by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board 
of Directors (or its delegate, as determined by the Board). Under the Incentive Plan, the Corporation has issued restricted stock and 
performance shares to its employees and restricted

stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”)

to its directors. 
The restricted

stock granted

under the

Incentive Plan

to employees

becomes vested

based on

the employees’

continued service 
with

Popular.

Unless

otherwise

stated

in

an

agreement
, the compensation cost associated with the shares of restricted stock 
granted prior to 2021 was determined based on a two-prong vesting schedule. These grants include ratable vesting over five or four 
years commencing at the date of grant (the “graduated vesting portion”) with a portion vested at termination of employment after 
attainment of 55 years of age and 10 years of service or 60 years of age and 5 years of service (the “retirement vesting portion”). 
The graduated vesting portion is accelerated at termination of employment after attaining 55 years of age and 10 years of service or 
60 years of age and 5 years of service. Restricted stock granted on or after 2021 have ratable vesting in equal annual installments 
over a period of 4 years or 3 years, depending in the classification of the employee. The vesting schedule is accelerated at 
termination of employment after attaining the earlier of 55 years of age and 10 years of service or 60 years of age and 5 years of 
service.

The

performance share

awards

granted

under

the

Incentive

Plan

consist

of

the

opportunity

to

receive

shares

of

Popular,

Inc.’s 
common stock provided that the Corporation achieves certain goals during a three-year performance cycle.

The goals will be based 
on

two

metrics

weighted

equally:

the

Relative

Total

Shareholder

Return

(“TSR”)

and

the

Absolute

Return

on

Average

Tangible 
Common Equity

(“ROATCE”).

The TSR metric

is considered to

be a

market condition under

ASC 718.

For equity settled

awards 
based

on a

market condition,

the

fair value

is

determined as

of the

grant date

and

is not

subsequently revised

based on

actual 
performance.

The

ROATCE

metric

is

considered

to

be

a

performance condition

under ASC

718.

The

fair value

is

determined 
based on

the probability

of achieving

the ROATCE

goal as

of each

reporting period.

The TSR

and ROATCE

metrics are

equally 
weighted and

work independently.

The number of shares that will ultimately vest ranges from 
50
% to a 
150
% of target based on 
both market (TSR) and performance (ROATCE) conditions. The performance shares vest at the end of the three-year performance 
cycle. If a participant terminates employment after attaining the earlier of 55 years of age and 10 years of service or 60 years of age 
and 5 years of service, the performance shares shall continue outstanding and vest at the end of the performance cycle.

the

Board

of

Directors

of

Popular,

Inc.

(the

“Directors”)

will

vest

and

become

non-
forfeitable on the

grant date of

such award. Effective

in May 2019,

all equity awards

granted to the

Directors may be

paid in either 
unrestricted stock

or RSUs

at each

Directors election.

If RSUs

are elected,

the Directors

may defer

the delivery

of the

shares of 
common stock

underlying the

RSUs award

until their

retirement. To

the extent

that cash

dividends are

paid on

the Corporation’s 
outstanding common stock, the Directors will

receive an additional number of RSUs

that reflect a reinvested dividend equivalent.

For 2024,

2023 and 2022,

Directors elected RSUs

and unrestricted stock.

For the year

ended December 31,

2024, 
24,070

RSUs 
and 
1,392

shares of unrestricted

stock were granted

to the Directors

(2023 - 
36,804

RSUs and 
2,300

shares of unrestricted stock; 
2022 - 
25,321

RSUs and 
no

shares of unrestricted stock).

For the year

ended December 31, 2024,

$
2.2

million of restricted stock 
expense related to these RSUs and unrestricted stocks were recognized, with a tax benefit of $
0.4

million (2023 - $
2.2

million with a 
tax benefit of

$
0.4

million; 2022 -

$
2.0

million with a

tax benefit of

$

The fair value

at vesting date

of the RSUs

Includes $
16.5

million of out-of-period adjustment.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation

recorded income tax expense of $
182.4

million, compared to $
134.2

million 
for the

same period

of 2023.

The net

increase of

$
48.2

million in

income tax

expense reflects

the impact

of the

composition and 
source of taxable income between both years.

In

addition,

and

as

disclosed

in Note

1,

during

the

first

quarter

of

2024,

the

income

tax

expense for

that

period included

$
22.9
million, related to intercompany distributions,

out of which $
16.5

million were related to

an out-of-period adjustment associated with 
the Corporation’s U.S. subsidiary’s non-payment of taxes on certain intercompany

distributions to the Bank Holding Company (BHC) 
in Puerto Rico, a foreign corporation for

U.S. tax purposes. During years 2023 and

2022, $
5.5

million and $
5.4

million, respectively, 
should have been

recognized as additional income

tax expense, and

an aggregate of

$
5.6

million in the

years prior to

2022.

As a 
result of

this adjustment,

the deferred

tax assets

related to

NOL of

the BHC

and its

related valuation

allowance was

reduced by 
$
52.2

million. The

Corporation also

recognized $
6.5

million in

income tax

expense during

the quarter

ended March

31, 2024,

to 
reflect the

U.S. federal

tax withholding

liability and

estimated related

Puerto Rico

income tax

arising from

a $
50.0

million dividend 
paid during that quarter.

252 
Deferred income taxes reflect the

net tax effects

of temporary differences between the

carrying amounts of assets and

liabilities for 
financial reporting

purposes and

their tax

bases. Significant

components of

the Corporation’s

The net deferred tax

asset shown in the

table above at

December 31, 2024, is

reflected in the consolidated

statements of financial 
condition as

$
926.3

million in

net deferred

tax assets

(in the

“other assets”

caption) (December

31, 2023

- $
1.0

billion) and

$
1.6
million in deferred tax liabilities (in the “other liabilities” caption) (December 31, 2023- $
1.3

million), reflecting the aggregate deferred 
tax assets or

liabilities of individual

tax-paying subsidiaries of the

Corporation in their

respective tax jurisdiction, Puerto

Rico or the 
United States.
The net

reduction in

the valuation

allowance of

approximately $
56.6

million during

the year

ended December

31, 
2024,

was

primarily

due

to

the

use

of

the

BHC

NOL

of

$
52.2

million

related

to

the

additional

income

recognized

on

certain 
intercompany distributions received during prior years until year 2023, as disclosed above and in Note 1; also, for

the first quarter of 
year 2024

an additional

distribution was issued

and the

NOL and valuation

allowance was

reduced by

$
17.1

million as

a result

of 
such additional

income.

These variances were

partially offset

due to

the increase in

valuation allowance, mostly

attributed to the 
change in the blended state tax rate applicable to net

operating losses of the U.S. operation. 
The deferred tax asset related to the NOLs and

other carryforwards as of December 31, 2024, expires

At December

31, 2024

the net

deferred tax

asset of the

U.S. operations

amounted to $
640.3

million with

a valuation

allowance of 
$
386.9

million, for

a net

deferred tax

asset of

$
253.4

million. The

Corporation evaluates on

a quarterly

basis the

realization of the 
deferred tax asset by taxing jurisdiction.

The U. S. operations sustained profitability for the three years

period ended December 31, 
2024.

These historical financial results are

objectively verifiable positive evidence, evaluated together

with the positive evidence

of 
stable credit metrics, in combination with the length of the

expiration of the NOLs. On the other hand, the Corporation

evaluated the 
negative evidence

accumulated over the

years, including financial

results lower

than expectations and

challenges to

the economy 
due to inflationary pressures and global geopolitical uncertainty that have

resulted in a trend of reduction of pre-tax income

over the 
last three

years. As

of December 31,

2024, after weighting

all positive

and negative evidence,

the Corporation concluded

that it

is 
more likely than

not that approximately

$
253.4

million of the

deferred tax assets from

the U.S. operations, comprised

mainly of net 
operating

losses,

will

be

realized.

The

Corporation

based

this

determination

on

its

estimated

earnings

available

to

realize

the 
deferred tax

assets for the

remaining carryforward period,

together with the

historical level of

book income adjusted

by permanent 
differences. Management will continue to monitor

and review the U.S. operation’s

results, including recent earnings trends, the

pre-
tax

earnings

forecast,

any

new

tax

initiative,

and

other

factors,

including

net

income

versus

forecast,

targeted

loan

growth,

net 
interest

income

margin,

changes

in

deposit

costs,

allowance

for

credit

losses,

charge

offs,

NPLs

inflows

and

NPA

balances. 
Significant adverse

changes or

a combination

of changes

in these

factors could

impact the

future realization

of the

deferred tax 
assets. 
At December 31,

2024, the Corporation’s

net deferred tax

assets related to

its Puerto Rico

operations amounted to

$
671.4

million. 
The Corporation’s

Puerto Rico

Banking operation

has strong

historical record

of profitability.

This is

considered a

strong piece

of 
objectively verifiable

positive evidence

that

outweigh any

negative evidence

considered by

Management in

the

evaluation of

the 
realization of the deferred tax asset.

Based on this evidence and Management’s estimate of future taxable income, the

Corporation 
has concluded that it is more likely than not that

such net deferred tax asset of the Puerto Rico

Banking operations will be realized. 

255 
The Holding Company operation has been in a

cumulative loss position in recent years.

Management expects these losses will be a 
trend

in

future

years.

This

objectively

verifiable

negative

evidence is

considered

by

Management strong

negative

evidence that 
suggests that

income in

future years

will be

insufficient to

support the

realization of

all deferred

tax assets.

After weighting

of all 
positive

and

negative evidence,

Management concluded

as

of

the reporting

date,

that

it

is

more

likely

than

not that

the

Holding 
Company will not be

able to realize any

portion of the deferred tax

assets. Accordingly, the

Corporation has maintained a valuation 
allowance on the deferred tax assets of $
69.8

million as of December 31, 2024. 
The Corporation’s

subsidiaries in

the United

States file

a consolidated

federal income

tax return.

The intercompany

settlement of 
taxes paid is based on tax sharing agreements

which generally allocate taxes to each

entity based on a separate return basis.

At

December 31,

2024, the

total amount

of

interest recognized

in the

statement of

financial condition

approximated

$
2.4

million 
(2023

-

$
2.3

million).

The

total

interest

expense

recognized

during

2024

was

$
110

thousand

(2023

-

$
199

thousand

net

of

a 
reduction of

$
475

thousand). Management determined

that, as

of December

31, 2024

and 2023, there

was no

need to

accrue for 
the payment of

penalties. The Corporation’s policy

is to report

interest related to

unrecognized tax benefits in

income tax expense, 
while the penalties, if any, are reported in other operating expenses

in the consolidated statements of operations.

After consideration

of the

effect on

U.S. federal

tax of

unrecognized U.S.

state tax

benefits, the

total amount

of unrecognized

tax 
benefits, including U.S. and Puerto Rico that, if recognized, would affect the Corporation’s effective tax rate, was approximately $
3.0
million at December 31, 2024 (2023 - $
2.9

million). 
The amount of

unrecognized tax benefits

may increase or

decrease in the

future for various

reasons including adding amounts

for 
current

tax

year

positions,

expiration

of

open

income

tax

returns

due

to

the

statute

of

limitations,

changes

in

management’s 
judgment about

the level

of uncertainty,

status of

examinations, litigation

and legislative

activity,

and the

addition or

elimination of 
uncertain tax positions.

The Corporation does not anticipate a

reduction in the total amount

of unrecognized tax benefits within the 
next 12 months. 
The

Corporation and

its subsidiaries

file

income tax

returns in

Puerto

Rico, the

U.S. federal

jurisdiction, various

U.S. states

and 
political subdivisions, and

foreign jurisdictions. As

of December 31,

2024, the

following years remain

subject to

examination in the 
U.S. Federal jurisdiction – 2021 and thereafter and

in the Puerto Rico jurisdiction – 2018 and thereafter.

Note 36 – Segment reporting 
The

Corporation’s

corporate

structure

consists

of 
two

reportable

segments

– 
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular U.S. 
Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess 
where to allocate resources.

The segments were

determined based on the

organizational structure, which focuses

primarily on the 
markets the segments serve, as well as on the products

and services offered by the segments. 
The chief operating

decision maker (“CODM”) of

the Corporation is

the Chief Executive

Officer (“CEO”) who

utilizes net income

as 
one of

the segment

profitability measures,

to evaluate

the performance

of each

reportable segment and

assess where

to allocate 
resources effectively.

The CEO

receives

profitability reports

that

include net

income

per segment,

net

interest income

and

other 
income

and expense

categories. The

CODM uses

the segment’s

net income

and components

of net

income, including

segment 
revenues and

expenses to

assess performance

and to

manage important

aspects by

each reportable

segments such

as human 
capital, investment in technology, making budget allocations as well as other strategic

decisions. 
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico:

The Banco Popular de

Puerto Rico reportable segment

includes commercial, consumer and retail

banking operations conducted at 
BPPR, including

U.S. based

activities conducted

through its

New York

Branch. It

also includes

the lending

operations of

Popular 
Auto

and

Popular

Mortgage.

Other

financial

services

within

the

BPPR

segment

include

the

trust

service

units

of

BPPR,

asset 
management services of Popular Asset Management and the brokerage operations of Popular Securities,

and the insurance agency 
and reinsurance businesses of Popular Insurance,

Popular Risk Services, Popular Life Re, and

Popular Re. 
Popular U.S.:

Popular U.S. reportable segment

consists of the

banking operations of Popular

Bank (PB), Popular Insurance

Agency, U.S.A.,

and 
PEF.

PB

operates through

a retail

branch network

in the

U.S. mainland

under the

name of

Popular,

and equipment

leasing and 
financing services through PEF.

Popular Insurance Agency,

U.S.A. offers investment and insurance

services across the PB

branch 
network.

The Corporate group

consists primarily of

the holding companies

Popular, Inc.,

Popular North America,

Popular International Bank 
and certain of the Corporation’s investments accounted for under

the equity method, including BHD.

The

accounting

policies

of

the

individual

operating

segments

are

the

same

as

those

of

the

Corporation.

Transactions

between 
reportable segments are primarily conducted at market rates, resulting

in profits that are eliminated for reporting consolidated results 
of

operations. Assets

representing transactions

between reportable

segments

or

the

Corporate

group

are

also

eliminated in
