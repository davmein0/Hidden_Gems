Item 1.

Business of this

Form 10-K for

additional information 
related to the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessments applicable

to BPPR and PB.

The resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable to us, could have material adverse financial 
effects or cause us significant reputational

harm, which, in turn, could seriously harm

our business prospects. 
We

face

legal

risks

in

our

businesses,

and

the

volume

of

claims

and

amount

of

damages

and

penalties

claimed

in 
litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions

remains high. We are involved

in a number of litigation,

arbitration 
and regulatory proceedings

in the

ordinary course of

our business. Substantial

legal liability or

significant regulatory action

against 
us could have material

adverse financial effects or cause significant

reputational harm to us or

other adverse consequences, which 
in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 24 - “Commitments & 
Contingencies”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements

in this Form 10-K. 
LIQUIDITY RISKS 
We

are subject

to liquidity

risks arising

from market

events or

disruptions and

instances of

low

investor and

depositor 
confidence. Furthermore, actions by the rating agencies

or decreases in our capital levels may have adverse

effects on our 
liquidity and business, including by raising the

cost of our obligations or affecting our ability

to borrow.

We must

maintain adequate liquidity

and funding sources

to support

our operations, fund

customer deposit withdrawals, 
repay

borrowings

and

debt,

comply

with

our

financial

obligations,

fund

planned

capital

distributions

and

meet

regulatory 
requirements.

The

Corporation’s

most

significant

source

of

funds

are

bank

deposits,

including

customer

deposits

and

brokered 
deposits.

In

addition

to

deposits,

sources

of

liquidity

include

secured

borrowing

arrangements,

such

as

those

with

the

Federal 
Reserve Bank of

New York

and the Federal

Home Loan Bank

of New York

(“FHLBNY”), unpledged securities from

our investment 
portfolio, the capital markets and proceeds from loan

sales or securitizations.

Popular’s

liquidity

and

ability

to

fund

and

operate

its

business

could

be

materially

adversely

affected

by

a

variety

of 
conditions and

factors, some

of which

are out

of Popular’s control.

For example,

market events

or disruptions,

such as

periods of 
market stress and

low investor confidence in

financial institutions could result

in deposit withdrawals, especially

to the extent

those 
deposits are in

excess of the

FDIC-insured limit of

$250,000. As of

December 31, 2024,

we had $13

billion of total

deposits (other 
than collateralized

public funds,

which represent

public deposit

balances from

governmental entities

in the

U.S. and

its territories, 
including Puerto Rico

and the

United States Virgin

Islands, that are

collateralized based on

such jurisdictions’

applicable collateral 
requirements) in excess of

the FDIC-insured limit. We

may also suffer outflows

of customer deposits due

to competition from

other 
banks or

alternative investments. In

addition, in

periods of

stress, we

may not

be able

to access

existing funding sources,

access 
the capital markets or to sell or securitize loans or

other assets, or to access such sources or to

sell or securitize assets on favorable 
terms. 
In addition, actions

by the rating agencies

could raise the cost

of our borrowings, since

lower rated securities are

usually 
required by the

market to pay

higher rates than

obligations of higher credit

quality. Our

credit ratings were

reduced substantially in 
2009 and, although one of

the three major rating agencies upgraded our

senior unsecured rating back to

“investment grade” during 
2021,

the

remaining

two

rating

agencies

have

not

upgraded

their

current

“non-investment

grade”

rating.

The

market

for

non-

34 
investment

grade securities

is

much

smaller

and

less

liquid than

for investment

grade securities.

If

we

were to

attempt

to

issue 
preferred stock

or debt

securities into

the capital

markets, it

is possible

that there

would not

be sufficient

demand to

complete a 
transaction or

that the

cost could

be substantially

higher than

for more

highly rated

securities. If

Popular is

unable to

access the 
capital markets on favorable terms, our liquidity

may be adversely affected. 
Changes in our ratings and capital levels could affect our

relationships with some creditors and limit our

access to funding. 
For example,

having negative

tangible capital

may impact

our ability

to

access some

sources of

wholesale funding.

The Federal 
Housing Finance

Agency restricts the

FHLBNY from

lending to

members of

the FHLBNY

with negative

tangible capital

unless the 
member’s primary banking regulator makes a written request to the

FHLBNY to maintain access to borrowings. Both BPPR

and PB 
have secured borrowing facilities with the FHLBNY and

could borrow up to $3.2 billion

and $1.5 billion respectively as of

December 
31,

2024,

of

which

$0.1

billion

and

$0.4

billion respectively

were used.

Losing

access

to

the

FHLBNY borrowing

facilities could 
adversely

impact

liquidity

at

the

banking

subsidiaries.

Additionally,

if

BPPR

or

PB

cease

to

be

well-capitalized,

the

FDIA

and 
regulations

adopted

thereunder

would

restrict

their

ability

to

accept

brokered

deposits

and

limit

the

rate

of

interest

payable

on 
deposits. 
Our banking

subsidiaries also

have recourse

obligations under certain

agreements with

third parties,

including servicing 
and custodial agreements, that include ratings covenants. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings,

the third parties could 
have

the

right

to

require

us

to

engage

a

substitute

fund

custodian

and

increase

collateral

levels

securing

recourse

obligations. 
Collateral

pledged by

us

to

secure

recourse

obligations approximated

$23.9 million

on

December 31,

2024.

While management 
expects that we would be able to meet any additional

collateral requirements if and when needed, the requirements

to post collateral 
under certain agreements or the loss of custodian

funds could reduce our liquidity resources and

impact our results of operations.

As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from

our subsidiaries for liquidity. 
As a bank holding company,

we depend primarily on dividends from

our banking and other operating subsidiaries

to fund 
our cash needs, including to capitalize our subsidiaries. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to 
make dividend

payments and other

distributions to

us based

on their earnings,

dividend history,

and capital

position. Based on

its 
current financial condition,

PB may

not declare or

pay a

dividend without the

prior approval of

the Federal Reserve

Board and

the 
NYSDFS. A

failure by

our banking subsidiaries

to generate

sufficient income

and free

cash flow to

make dividend

payments to

us 
may

affect

our

ability to

fund

our cash

needs, which

could have

a negative

impact on

our financial

condition, liquidity,

results

of 
operation or capital position. Such failure could also affect

our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and to

repurchase shares 
of our common stock. We have in the past suspended dividend payments

on our common stock and preferred stock during times of 
economic uncertainty,

and there

can be

no assurance

that we

will be

able to

continue to

declare dividends to

our stockholders

in 
any future periods.

An

impact

on

the

tangible

capital

levels

of

our

operating

subsidiaries,

could

also

limit

the

amount

of

capital

we

may 
upstream to the holding company. Tangible

capital levels have in the past been, and may in the future be,

adversely affected by the 
impact of

rapidly rising interest

rates on investment

securities in our

available-for-sale portfolio. For

a discussion of

risks related to 
changes in interest

rates, see “Changes

in interest rates

and credit spreads

can adversely impact

our financial condition,

including 
our investment portfolio, since a significant portion of

our business involves borrowing and lending money,

and investing in financial 
instruments” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
We also depend

on dividends from our

banking and other operating subsidiaries

to pay debt service

on outstanding debt 
and to repay maturing debt. Our ability to

declare such dividends would be subject to regulatory requirements and could

require the 
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
STRATEGIC RISKS 
Potential acquisitions of businesses or

loan portfolios could increase some

of the risks that

we face, and may

be delayed 
or prohibited due to regulatory constraints. 
To

the extent

permitted by

our applicable

regulators, we

may pursue

strategic acquisition

opportunities. Acquiring

other 
businesses, however, involves various risks,

including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the

target company, 
exposure

to

potential

asset

quality

issues

of

the

target

company,

potential

disruption

to

our

business,

the

possible

loss

of

key 
employees and customers of

the target company,

and difficulty in

estimating the value of

the target company.

If we pay

a premium 
over book or

market value in

connection with an

acquisition, some dilution of

our tangible book

value and net

income per common 
share may occur.

Furthermore, failure to

realize the expected

revenue increases, cost savings,

increases in geographic

or product 

35 
presence, or

other projected

benefits from an

acquisition could have

a material

adverse effect

on our

business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
Similarly,

acquiring

loan

portfolios

involves

various

risks.

When

acquiring

loan

portfolios,

management

makes 
assumptions and

judgments about

the collectability

of the

loans, including

the creditworthiness

of borrowers

and the

value of

the 
real

estate and

other assets

serving

as collateral

for the

repayment of

secured loans.

In

estimating the

extent of

the losses,

we 
analyze

the

loan

portfolio

based

on

historical

loss

experience,

volume

and

classification

of

loans,

volume

and

trends

in 
delinquencies

and

nonaccruals,

local

economic

conditions,

and

other

pertinent

information.

If

our

assumptions

are

incorrect, 
however,

our actual

losses could

be higher

than estimated

and increased

loss reserves

may be

required, which

would negatively 
affect our results of operations. 
Finally, certain

acquisitions by financial institutions,

including us, are

subject to approval

by a variety

of federal and

state 
regulatory agencies.

Regulatory approvals

could be

delayed, impeded,

restrictively conditioned

or denied.

We may

fail to

pursue, 
evaluate

or

complete

strategic

and

competitively

significant

acquisition

opportunities

as

a

result

of

our

inability,

or

perceived

or 
anticipated inability,

to obtain regulatory

approvals in a

timely manner,

under reasonable conditions or

at all. Difficulties

associated 
with

potential

acquisitions

that

may

result

from

these

factors

could

have

a

material

adverse

effect

on

our

business,

financial 
condition and results of operations. 
We

have

embarked

on

a

broad-based

multi-year,

technological

and

business

process

transformation.

The

failure

to 
achieve the

goals of

the transformation project,

the inability

to maintain

expenses related

to our

transformation program 
within current

estimates or

delays in

executing our

plans may

materially and

adversely affect

our business,

competitive 
position, financial condition, results of operations,

or cause reputational harm. 
The Corporation has embarked on

a broad-based multi-year,

technological and business process transformation. As

part 
of this

transformation, we are

making significant investments

in technology,

talent and

new digital

and data

capabilities in

order to 
provide our customers with more personalized and

accessible services, increase employee performance and satisfaction with more 
agile work processes, and generate sustainable

profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

We may

not succeed in

executing the transformation

program, may fail

to properly estimate

costs of the

same, or may

experience 
delays in executing our plans, which may in turn cause the Corporation to incur costs exceeding our current estimates or disrupt our 
operations, including our technological services to our

customers, or fall short of our projected earnings or

expense reduction targets 
driven

by

these

efforts.

To

the

extent

that

these

disruptions

persist

over

time

and/or

recur,

this

could

negatively

impact

our 
competitive

position,

require

additional

expenditures, and/or

harm

our

relationships

with

our

customers

and

thus

may

materially 
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results

of operations, or cause reputational harm.
We face significant and increasing competition in the

rapidly evolving financial services industry. 
We

operate

in

a

highly competitive

environment, in

which

we

compete

on

the

basis

of

a

number of

factors,

including 
customer service,

quality and variety

of products

and services,

price, interest rates

on loans

and deposits,

innovation, technology, 
ease of use, reputation, and transaction execution. While our main competition

continues to come from other Puerto Rico banks and 
financial institutions, we

face increased competition

from non-Puerto Rico

institutions, as emerging

technologies and the

growth of 
e-commerce

have

significantly

reduced

geographic

barriers.

These

technologies

have

also

made

it

easier

for

non-depositary 
institutions to

offer products

and services

that were

traditionally considered

banking products

and allowed

non-traditional financial 
service

providers and

technology companies

to

provide electronic

and

internet-based financial

solutions

and services.

Increased 
competition could create pressure to lower prices, fees, commissions or

credit standards on our products and services, which could 
adversely affect our

financial condition and results

of operations. Increased competition could

also create pressure to

raise interest 
rates

on deposits

or increase

deposit attrition,

which could

negatively impact

our business,

financial condition,

liquidity results

of 
operations or capital position. 
If we are unable to

meet constant technological changes and react quickly to

meet new industry standards, including as a 
result

of our

continued dependence

on

Evertec, we

may

be unable

to enhance

our

current services

and introduce

new 
products and

services in

a timely

and cost-effective

manner,

placing us

at a

competitive disadvantage

and significantly 
affecting our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations

or capital position. 
To compete effectively,

we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products 
and

services

to

attract

and

retain

clients

or

to

match

products

and

services

offered

by

our

competitors,

including

technology 
companies and other

nonbank firms that

are engaged in

providing similar products

and services. Our

ability to compete

effectively 
will

depend

in

part

on

our

ability

to

react

quickly

to

meet

new

industry

standards

and

use

new

technology,

such

as

artificial 

36 
intelligence, to satisfy customer

demands, as well as

to create additional efficiencies

in our operations.

Popular expects that it

will 
continue to depend

on Evertec’s technology services

to operate and

control current products and

services and to

implement future 
products and

services, making

our success

dependent on

Evertec’s ability

to timely

complete and

introduce these

enhancements 
and new products and services in a cost-effective manner.

Some

of

our

competitors

rely

on

financial

services

technology

and

outsourcing

companies

that

are

much

larger

than 
Evertec, serve a

greater number of

clients than Evertec,

and may have

better technological capabilities and

product offerings than 
Evertec.

Furthermore,

financial

services

technology

companies

typically

make

capital

investments

to

develop

and

modify

their 
product

and

service

offerings

to

facilitate

their

customers’

compliance

with

the

extensive

and

evolving

regulatory

and

industry 
requirements, and,

in most

cases, such

costs are

borne by

the technology

provider.

Because of

our contractual

relationship with 
Evertec, and because Popular is the

sole customer of certain of

Evertec’s services and products, we

have in the past borne

the full 
cost of such developments and modifications and

may be required to do so in the future, subject

to the terms of the MSA. 
Moreover,

the terms,

speed, scalability,

and functionality

of certain

of Evertec’s

technology services

are not

competitive 
when compared

to offerings

from its

competitors. Evertec’s

failure to

sufficiently invest

in and

upscale its

technology and

services 
infrastructure to

meet the

rapidly changing

technology demands

of our

industry may

result in

us being

unable to

meet

customer 
expectations and

attract or

retain customers.

Furthermore, Evertec’s

strategy and

investments may

also be

refocused away

from 
Popular

towards other

strategic initiatives.

Any such

impact could,

in turn,

reduce Popular’s

revenues, place

us

in

a competitive 
disadvantage and

significantly affect

our business,

financial condition,

liquidity,

results of

operations or

capital position.

While we 
have

over

time

narrowed

the

scope

of

services

which

we

are

dependent

on

Evertec

to

obtain,

in

exchange

for

releases

from 
exclusivity restrictions

that

limited our

ability to

engage other

third-party

providers of

financial technology

services, we

agreed to

extensions of certain existing commercial agreements with Evertec and, as

a result, have prolonged the duration of our

exposure to 
the risks presented by Evertec’s

technological capabilities and its failures to

enhance its products and services

and otherwise meet 
evolving

demands.

We

may

also

be

exposed

to

heightened

business

risks

in

connection

with

our

dependency

on

Evertec

with 
respect to BPPR’s

merchant acquiring business,

which exclusivity was

extended until 2035,

and with respect

to the

ATH

Network, 
which commitment BPPR extended until 2030, in light

of the pace of technology changes and competition

in the payments industry. 
The ability to attract and retain qualified employees

is critical to our success. 
Our

success

depends,

in

large

part,

on

our

ability

to

attract

and

retain

qualified

employees.

Competition

for

qualified 
candidates,

especially in

the

area of

information technology,

is

intense

and

has

increased

recently as

a

result

of

a

tighter

labor 
market.

Increased

competition

may

lead

to

difficulties

in

attracting

or

retaining

qualified

employees, which

may,

in

turn,

lead

to 
significant challenges in the execution of our business strategies

and have an adverse effect on the quality of the service we provide 
to

the

customers

and

communities

we

serve.

Such

challenges

could

adversely

affect

our

business,

operations

and

financial 
condition. In addition, increased competition

may lead to higher compensation

packages and more flexible work

arrangements. We 
may also be required to hire employees outside of

our market areas for certain positions that require specific expertise,

which could 
result in

employment and tax

compliance-related expenses, challenges

and risks. In

addition, flexible work

arrangements, such as 
remote or hybrid work

models, have led to

other workplace challenges, including fewer opportunities for

face-to-face interactions or 
to promote a cohesive corporate culture and heightened

cybersecurity, information security and other operational risks. 
Our

ability

to

attract

and

retain

qualified

employees

is

also

impacted

by

regulatory

limitations

on

our

compensation 
practices, such as clawback requirements of incentive compensation, which may not affect other institutions with which we compete 
for talent.

The scope

and content of

regulators’ policies

on executive compensation

continue to

develop and are

likely to

continue 
evolving. Such policies and limitations on our compensation

practices could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate 
talented senior leaders in support of our long-term

strategy. 
OTHER RISKS 
An impairment

of our

goodwill, deferred

tax assets

or amortizable

intangible assets

could adversely

affect our

financial 
condition and results of operations. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $803 million, $926 million and $143 million, respectively, of goodwill, net 
deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets,

including capitalized software costs, recorded on

our balance sheet. 
Under

GAAP,

goodwill

is

tested

for

impairment

at

least

annually

and

amortizable

intangible

assets

are

tested

for 
impairment

when

events

or

changes

in

circumstances indicate

the

carrying value

may

not

be

recoverable. Factors

that

may

be 
considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be 
recoverable, include

a decline in

Popular’s stock price

related to

a deterioration in

global or

local economic conditions,

declines in 

37 
our market capitalization, reduced future earnings estimates, and interest rate changes. The goodwill impairment evaluation process 
requires

us

to

make

estimates

and

assumptions

with

regards

to

the

fair

value

of

our

reporting

units.

Actual

values

may

differ 
significantly

from

these

estimates.

Such

differences

could

result

in

future

impairment

of

goodwill

that

would,

in

turn,

negatively 
impact our results of operations and the reporting

unit where the goodwill is recorded. 
The

determination

of

whether

a

deferred

tax

asset

is

realizable

is

based

on

weighting

all

available

evidence.

The 
realization

of

deferred

tax

assets, including

carryforwards

and

deductible temporary

differences,

depends upon

the

existence

of 
sufficient taxable

income of the

same character during

the carryback or

carryforward period. The

analysis considers all

sources of 
taxable income

available to

realize the

deferred tax

asset, including

the future

reversal of

existing taxable

temporary differences, 
future taxable income

exclusive of reversing temporary

differences and carryforwards,

taxable income in

prior carryback years

and 
tax-planning strategies. Changes in these

factors may affect

the realizability of our

deferred tax assets in

our Puerto Rico and

U.S. 
operations. 
If our

goodwill, deferred

tax assets

or amortizable

intangible assets

become impaired,

we may

be required

to record

a 
significant charge to earnings, which could adversely

affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
We could experience unexpected

losses if the estimates

or assumptions we use

in preparing our financial

statements are 
incorrect or differ materially from actual results.

In preparing

our financial

statements pursuant to

U.S. GAAP,

we are

required to

make estimates

and assumptions

that 
are often based

on subjective and

complex judgments about

matters that are

inherently uncertain. For example,

we use estimates 
and assumptions to determine our allowance for credit losses, our

liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain 
of our

assets and

liabilities, such

as debt

securities, loans

held for

sale, MSRs,

intangible assets

and deferred

tax assets.

If such 
estimates

or

assumptions are

incorrect

or

differ

materially

from

actual

results,

we

could

experience

unexpected

losses

or

other 
adverse impacts, some of which could be significant.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
None. 
Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
The

Corporation

assesses,

identifies

and

manages

cybersecurity

risk

as

part

of

the

Corporation’s

overall

risk

management 
framework, alongside

associated information

security,

anti-money laundering

and counterterrorism,

operational, fraud,

regulatory, 
legal and reputational risks, among others.

The Corporation has established three management

committees that oversee and monitor different aspects of

cybersecurity risk. 
●

The

Enterprise Risk

Management Committee

(the “ERM

Committee”), chaired

by

the Chief

Risk Officer,

oversees and 
monitors

the

risks

included

in

the

Risk Appetite

Statement

(the

“RAS”)

of

the

Corporation’s

Risk

Management

Policy, 
including cybersecurity risks.

●

The Information

Technology and

Cyber Risk

Committee (“ITCRC”),

chaired by

the Chief

Security

Officer and

the Chief 
Information and

Digital Strategy

Officer, oversees

and monitors

information technology

(“IT”), privacy

and cybersecurity 
risks, mitigating

actions and

controls, applicable

regulatory developments, key

risks metrics,

and IT

and cyber

incidents 
that may result in operational, compliance and reputational

risks. 
●

The

Operational

Risk

Committee (“ORCO”),

chaired

by

the

Chief Risk

Officer,

oversees

and

monitors

operational

risk 
management activities

to ensure

the development

and consistent

application of

operational risk

policies, processes

and 
procedures that

measure, limit

and manage

the Corporation's

operational risks

while maintaining

the effectiveness

and 
efficiency

of

the

operating and

business

processes. As

part

of

its

responsibilities, ORCO

oversees business

continuity 
matters, as well as operational losses stemming

from any cybersecurity or fraud events.
The ITCRC and ORCO meet at least quarterly

and report on cybersecurity and other matters

to the ERM Committee.
The Board

has also established

a Board-level Risk

Management Committee (“RMC”),

which is responsible

for the

oversight of the 

38 
Corporation’s overall risk framework, and assists the Board in the monitoring, review and approval of the policies that measure, limit 
and manage the Corporation’s risks, including cybersecurity

risk. The RMC holds periodic meetings in

which management provides 
an

overview of

Popular’s cybersecurity

threat

risk management

and strategy

processes,

which includes

summaries

of

escalated 
incidents

and

incident

remediation

status.

Our

Chief

Security

Officer,

Chief

Information

and

Digital

Strategy

Officer,

Chief 
Information Security Officer

(“CISO”), Chief Risk

Officer and the

Financial and Operational

Risk Management Division

(the “FORM 
Division”)

Manager

generally

participate

in

such

meetings.

The

RMC

is

also

responsible

for

(i)

overseeing

the

development, 
implementation

and

maintenance

of

the

Corporation’s

information

security

program

(the

“Information

Security

Program”);

(ii) 
approving the Corporation’s risk management program

and any related policies and controls;

(iii) overseeing the implementation by 
the Corporation’s

management of

the Corporation’s

risk management

program and

any related

policies, procedures

and controls; 
and (iv) reviewing reports regarding selected topics

such as cyber.
The Board in turn also receives briefings on cybersecurity matters and risks, including an annual presentation from the Chief 
Security Officer and the CISO on the Information Security Program.
In

addition,

as

part

of

the

Board’s

director

education

plan, 
members of the

Board take, on

an annual basis,

a cybersecurity training that

provides the Board with

an overview of

cybersecurity 
principles and regulations that are relevant to our institution

and the Board’s oversight function.
To identify, assess and manage risks from cybersecurity threats, the Corporation has established a three lines of defense 
framework. The first line of defense is composed of business line management that identifies and manages the risks associated with 
business activities, including cybersecurity risk. The second line of defense is made up of members of the Corporation’s Corporate 
Risk Management Group and the Corporate Security Group (the “CSG”) who, among other things, measure and report on the 
Corporation’s risk activities. In such line of defense, the FORM Division, within the Corporate Risk Management Group, is 
responsible for (i) establishing baseline metrics that measure, monitor, limit and manage the framework that identifies and manages 
multiple and cross-enterprise risks, including cybersecurity risks; and (ii) articulating the RAS and supporting metrics, including 
those related to operational risk, business continuity, disaster recovery and third-party management oversight processes. 
Meanwhile, Popular’s Cyber Security Division (the “CSD”), which is headed by the CISO and reports to the CSG, is responsible for 
the development of strategies, policies and programs to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Members of the CSD (including the 
CISO) and FORM Division report on and escalate cybersecurity, IT and privacy risks to management committees, such as the 
ITCRC, ORCO and ERM Committee, and, if appropriate, to the RMC and the Board of Directors, as required under relevant policies 
and procedures. Lastly, the third line of defense consists of the Corporate Auditing Division, which independently provides 
assurance regarding the effectiveness of the risk framework and reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board.
Popular monitors various vectors of threats and utilizes open-source intelligence forums and communities such as the Financial 
Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, among others, to 
receive threat intelligence feeds which are reviewed by the CSD. As cybersecurity threats are identified, they are evaluated to 
assess the level of exposure and the potential risk to Popular. The ITCRC and the ERM Committee discuss and track the threats 
identified in internal assessments and scans or in third-party reports. Depending on the evolution and materiality of the threat, these 
are escalated to the RMC as appropriate.
The CSD

develops the

Information Security Program,

which considers and

evaluates risks

posed by

cybersecurity threats,

events 
and

activities

impacting

the

industry

and

the

Corporation.

The

Information

Security

Program

outlines

the

Corporation’s

overall 
strategy and

governance to

protect the

confidentiality,

integrity and

availability of

information and

prevent access

by unauthorized 
personnel, and is based on standards and controls set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology

(“NIST”), including the 
NIST’s Framework for

Improving Critical Infrastructure

Cybersecurity. Popular

currently leverages the

Cyber Assessment Tool

(the 
“CAT”), a tool based on NIST standards and controls developed by the Federal Financial Institutions

Examination Council (“FFIEC”), 
in order to measure the

Corporation’s cybersecurity preparedness and maturity levels.

The CAT

assessment results are integrated 
into

the overall

Information Security

Program evaluation.

In

2025, we

will

transition to

the Cyber

Risk Institute

(“CRI”) Profile

2.0 
assessment framework, following the announcement by the FFIEC of the sunset

of the CAT in

2025. The CRI Profile was produced 
through public-private collaboration and is a list of assessment questions curated based

on the intersection of global regulations and 
cyber standards, such as the International Standards

Organization (ISO) and the NIST.

The CSD

also manages the

Incident Response Program

(“IRP”) of the

Corporation and is

in charge of

overseeing, assessing and 
managing cyber

incidents. The

IRP outlines

the measures

Popular must

take to

prepare for,

detect, respond

to and

recover from 
cybersecurity

incidents,

which

include

processes

to

triage,

assess

severity

for,

escalate,

contain,

investigate

and

remediate 
incidents, as well as to comply with potentially

applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand

and reputational damage.

The Corporation also undertakes the below listed

additional activities in its effort

to maintain regulatory compliance, identify,

assess 
and manage its material risks from cybersecurity

threats, and to protect against, detect and

respond to cybersecurity incidents:

39 
●

Conduct

tabletop

exercises

that

simulate

cybersecurity

incidents

to

raise

awareness

and

enhance

Popular’s

responsive 
measures; 
●

Assess how business

and corporate strategies, new

products, technology deployments, external

events and the

evolution of 
threats impact

the Corporation’s

information security

controls in

order to

determine if

they require

any additional

resources, 
technology or processes; 
●

Discuss cybersecurity risks with law enforcement, peer

groups, industry forums and trade associations; 
●

Provide training

to all

Popular employees

upon hiring

and annually

thereafter on

cybersecurity and

customer data

handling 
and use requirements; 
●

Offer training and awareness campaigns to customers and employees

based on their role;

●

Conduct

phishing

simulations

for

employees,

with

escalation

protocols

for

employees

that

fail

such

tests

to

enhance 
awareness and responsiveness to such possible

threats; 
●

Offer learning and development opportunities to employees

who handle and manage cybersecurity matters; 
●

Carry cyber insurance to provide protection against

potential losses arising from cybersecurity incidents;

and 
●

Monitor emerging

legal and

regulatory requirements

and implement

changes to

our processes,

policies and

statements, as 
necessary.
Popular engages third parties to assist in certain cybersecurity matters.
In particular, Popular uses the expertise of third parties to 
perform specialized assessments to test its systems, such as periodic penetration testing, that provide insights into the effectiveness 
of its controls. Popular also engages third parties to provide computer forensics and investigations services as needed to assess 
and address actual or potential cybersecurity incidents. In addition, Popular hires third parties to provide the first level security 
monitoring of Popular’s external and internal networks.

Popular’s Outsourced

Risk Management

Policy

outlines the

management of

risks

associated with

the Corporation’s

use

of third-
party service

providers, and

the CSG

assesses the

impact and

level of

cybersecurity and

privacy risk

of such

providers. Popular 
performs due diligence on

third parties and monitors third

parties that have access to

its systems, data or facilities

that house such 
systems or data on a

periodic basis, and based on due

diligence results, determines how often vendor assessments are

performed 
on such third party.

Popular also conducts periodic application and vendor assessments for third-party providers

and their products. 
Furthermore, Popular requires third parties that have

access to its systems, data or facilities that house

such systems or data to take 
a training on cybersecurity at least annually. 
Under the heading “We and our third-party providers have been, and expect in the future to continue to be, subject to cyber-attacks, 
which could cause

substantial harm and

have an adverse

effect on our

business and results

of operations.” and

“We rely on

other 
companies to

provide key components

of our

business infrastructure, including

certain of

our core financial

transaction processing 
and information

technology and

security services,

which exposes

us to

a number

of

operational risks

that could

have a

material 
adverse

effect

on

us.”,
