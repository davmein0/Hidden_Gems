ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
We, like

other financial institutions,

face risks

inherent to

our business,

financial condition, liquidity,

results of

operations 
and

capital

position.

These

risks

could

cause

our

actual

results

to

differ

materially

from

our

historical

results

or

the

results 
contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained

in this report. 
The risks described in

this report are not the

only risks we face. Additional

risks and uncertainties not currently

known by 
us

or

that

we

currently

deem

to

be

immaterial,

or

that

are

generally

applicable

to

all

financial

institutions,

may

also

materially 
adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital

position. 

24 
ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS 
Weakness in

the economy,

particularly in

Puerto Rico,

where a

significant portion

of our

business is

concentrated, has

adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely

impact us in the future. 
We have been, and will continue to be, impacted by global and local

economic and market conditions, including weakness 
in

the

economy,

disruptions

and

volatility

in

the

financial

markets,

inflation,

monetary,

trade

and

fiscal

policies,

public

policy, 
geopolitical conflicts, business and consumer sentiment

and unemployment. A significant portion of

our business is concentrated in 
Puerto Rico, which

accounted for approximately 77% of

our assets and 80%

of our deposits

as of December 31,

2024 and 79%

of 
our

revenues

for

the

year

ended

December

31,

2024.

As

a

result,

our

financial

condition

and

results

of

operations

are

highly 
dependent

on

the

general

trends

of

the

Puerto

Rico

economy

and

other

conditions

affecting

Puerto

Rico

consumers

and 
businesses. The

concentration of

our operations

in Puerto

Rico exposes

us to

greater risks

than other

banking companies

with a 
wider geographic base. 
Puerto Rico

has faced significant

economic and fiscal

challenges in the

past, including a

severe recession that

began in 
2007 and

persisted for

over a

decade and

an acute

fiscal crisis

that led

the Puerto

Rico government

to file

for a

form

of federal 
bankruptcy protection

in 2017.

Puerto Rico’s

fiscal and

economic challenges

have in

the past

adversely affected

our customers, 
resulting

in

higher

delinquencies,

charge-offs

and

increased

losses

for

us.

While

Puerto

Rico’s

economy

has

been

gradually 
recovering

and

the

Puerto

Rico

government

emerged from

bankruptcy

in

2022,

Puerto

Rico

still

faces

significant

economic

and 
fiscal challenges.

Puerto Rico’s

economy is

closely tied

to the

U.S. economy,

as well

as

highly reliant

on U.S.

public policy

and funding 
decisions. Puerto Rico

has historically received

significant federal support

for a

wide range of

government programs and

services, 
including healthcare, education,

infrastructure and social

assistance programs. More

recently, Puerto

Rico has

received significant 
federal stimulus,

disaster relief and

reconstruction funding, which

has served as

a major

driver of

economic activity.

Reductions in 
federal

funding

for

Puerto

Rico

or

delays

in

disbursements

could

significantly

impact

Puerto

Rico’s

economy

and

hinder 
reconstruction efforts, including the restoration

and improvement of critical infrastructure. The

Trump Administration is conducting

a 
review

of

federal

funding,

and

we

believe

that

the

amount

of

federal

funding

to

programs

that

have

benefited

the

Puerto

Rico 
economy could

be reduced,

perhaps significantly.

Beyond direct

funding, broader

shifts in

U.S. policy,

such as

changes to

tax or 
trade policies,

and shifts

in policies

of

other governments

in response,

could also

adversely impact

the Puerto

Rico economy.

A 
weakening of

the Puerto

Rico

economy

or

other

adverse economic

conditions affecting

Puerto

Rico consumers

and

businesses 
could

result

in

decreased

demand

for

our

products

or

services,

deterioration

in

the

credit

quality

of

our

customers,

higher 
delinquencies, charge-offs or increased losses,

all of which could adversely affect

our business, financial condition, liquidity,

results 
of operations or capital position. 
We are

also exposed

to risks

related to

the state

of the

local economies

of the

other markets

in which

we do

business, 
such as

New York

and Florida, as

well as to

the state of

the global and

U.S. economy and

financial markets. Evolving

geopolitical 
tensions, the introduction

or escalation of tariffs,

inflationary pressures and other

political or economic shifts

may lead to

increased 
market volatility

and disruption.

These factors

could, in

turn, adversely

impact our

business, financial condition,

liquidity,

results of 
operations or capital position. 
Changes

in

interest

rates

and

credit

spreads

can

adversely

impact

our

financial

condition,

including

our

investment 
portfolio,

since

a

significant

portion

of

our

business involves

borrowing

and

lending

money,

and

investing in

financial 
instruments. 
Our business

and financial

performance are

impacted by

market interest

rates and

movements in

those rates.

Since a 
high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes 
in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates, have had and could in the future have 
a material impact on our results

of operations and the values of our

assets and liabilities, including our investment portfolio.

Interest 
rates are

highly sensitive

to many

factors over

which we

have no

control and

which we

may not

be able

to anticipate

adequately, 
including general

economic conditions

and the

monetary and

tax policies

of various

governmental bodies,

particularly the

Federal 
Reserve Board.

Changes in

these policies,

including changes

in interest

rates, impact

various aspects

of our

business, including 
loan originations,

the speed

of prepayments,

loan delinquencies,

the value

of our

investments, the

rates we

receive on

our loans 
and investment

securities, our

ability to

maintain and

generate deposits

and the

rates we

pay on

our deposits

and other

funding 
sources. The

effects of

these changes

may be

amplified if

we are

unable to

effectively manage

the sensitivity

of our

assets and 
liabilities to market interest rate changes.

The

rapid

rise

in

interest

rates

in

2022

resulted

in

approximately

$2.5

billion

in

unrealized

mark-to-market

losses

on 

25 
available-for-sale securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In October 2022, we transferred U.S. Treasury securities with 
a fair value of approximately $6.5 billion (par value of

$7.4 billion), and with accumulated unrealized losses of $873 million, from our 
available-for-sale portfolio to

our held-to-maturity portfolio.

While the size

of our unrealized

mark-to-market losses on

available-for-
sale

securities

had

been

reduced

to

$1.3

billion

as

of

December

31,

2024,

if

interest

rates

were

to

again

rise

rapidly

or

for

a 
prolonged period, we may accumulate significant additional mark-to-market

losses on investment securities in our available-for-sale 
portfolio, which may adversely affect our tangible capital

and impact our ability to return capital to our

stockholders. 
For a discussion of the Corporation’s

interest rate sensitivity, please refer

to the “Risk Management” section of the MD&A 
in this Form 10-K. 
BUSINESS RISKS 
Negative

changes

in

the

financial

condition

of

our

clients

have

adversely

impacted

us

in

the

past

and

may

adversely 
impact us in the future. 

A significant portion of

our business involves lending money,

which exposes us to

credit risk and

risk of loss if

borrowers 
do

not

repay

their

loans,

leases, credit

cards

or

other

credit

obligations.

The

performance of

these

credit

portfolios

significantly 
affects our

financial condition

and results

of operations.

We have

in the

past been

adversely affected

by negative

changes in

the 
financial condition of our clients due to weakness in

the Puerto Rico and U.S. economy. If the current economic environment were to 
deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations, which may result in higher levels

of credit losses 
and reserves for credit losses. 
We are exposed to

increased credit risks and credit losses

to the extent our clients are

concentrated by industry segment 
or type of client. 
Our credit risk and credit

losses can increase to the extent

our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in

the same 
or similar

activities or

in borrowers

who as

a group

may be

uniquely or

disproportionately affected

by certain

economic or

market 
conditions. We have significant

exposure to borrowers in certain

economic sectors, such as residential

and commercial real estate, 
hospitality and healthcare. Challenging economic or market conditions that affect

the industries or types of clients to

which we have 
significant exposure

could result

in higher

credit

losses and

adversely affect

our business,

financial condition,

liquidity,

results of 
operations or capital position. 
We also

have direct

lending and

investment exposure

to Puerto

Rico government

entities, which

have faced

significant 
fiscal challenges.

At December

31, 2024,

our exposure

to the

Puerto Rico

government consisted

of $336

million in

direct lending 
exposure to Puerto

Rico municipalities and

$220 million in

loans insured or

securities issued by

Puerto Rico governmental

entities 
but for which the principal

source of repayment is non-governmental.

and indirect lending exposure to the

Puerto Rico government 
in the

form of

loans to

private borrowers

who are

service providers,

lessors, suppliers

or have

other relationships

with the

Puerto 
Rico government. While the overall fiscal situation of the Puerto

Rico government has improved in recent years, including

as a result 
of

the

government

and

certain

of

its

instrumentalities

having

restructured

their

debt

obligations,

some

Puerto

Rico

government 
entities, including certain municipalities, still face significant fiscal challenges.

A deterioration in the fiscal situation of the Puerto Rico 
government and its

instrumentalities, and in

particular the fiscal

situation of the

Puerto Rico

municipalities to which

we have

direct 
lending

exposure,

could

result

in

higher

credit

losses

and

reserves

for

credit

losses.

For

a

discussion

of

risks

related

to

the 
Corporation’s credit exposure

to the Puerto

Rico and USVI

governments, see the

Geographic and Government

Risk section in

the 
MD&A section of this Form 10-K. 
Deterioration in the

values of real

properties securing our commercial, mortgage

loan and construction portfolios

have in 
the past resulted, and may in the future result,

in increased credit losses and harm our results

of operations.
As of

December 31,

2024, approximately

55% of

our loan

portfolio consisted

of loans

secured by

real estate

collateral 
(comprised of 29% in commercial loans, 22% in residential

mortgage loans and 3% in construction loans). The

value of the collateral 
securing such loans is dependent upon economic conditions in the area in which the collateral is located. Weakness in the economy 
of some of the

markets we serve has in

the past resulted in significant

declines in the value of

the real properties securing our

loan 
portfolio, leading to increased credit losses. If the value of

the real estate properties securing our loan portfolio declines again in

the 
future, we may be

required to increase our

provisions for loan losses

and allowance for loan

losses. Any such increase could

have 
an adverse effect on

our financial condition and results of

operations. For more information on the credit

quality of our construction, 
commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit

Risk section of the MD&A included in this

Form 10-K.
Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business

and financial condition. 

26 
In

connection

with

the

sale

and

securitization

of

mortgage

loans,

we

are

required

to

make

a

variety

of

customary 
representations

and

warranties regarding

Popular

and

the

loans

being

sold

or

securitized.

Our

obligations with

respect to

these 
representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the

life of the loan, and they

relate to, among other things, compliance 
with

laws

and

regulations,

underwriting

standards,

the

accuracy

of

information

in

the

loan

documents

and

loan

file

and

the 
characteristics

and

enforceability of

the

loan.

A

loan

that

does

not

comply

with

the

secondary

market’s

requirements

may

take 
longer to

sell, impact

our ability

to securitize

the loans

or pledge

the loans

as collateral

for borrowings,

or be

unsalable or

salable 
only

at

a

significant

discount.

Moreover,

if

any

such

loan

is

sold

before

we

detect

non-compliance,

we

may

be

obligated

to 
repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly,

or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss.

We 
seek to

minimize repurchases and

losses from defective

loans by correcting

flaws, if possible,

and selling or

re-selling such loans. 
However,

if

we

were

to

suffer

significant

losses

from

defective

and

repurchased

loans,

our

results

of

operations

and

financial 
condition could be materially impacted. 
If we are

unable to maintain

or grow our

deposits, we may

be subject to

paying higher funding costs

and our net

interest 
income may decrease. 

We rely primarily on bank deposits as a low cost and

stable source of funding for our lending and

investment activities and 
the operation of

our business. Therefore, our

funding costs are largely

dependent on our ability

to maintain and

grow our deposits. 
As

our

competitors

have

raised

the

interest

rates

they

pay

on

deposits,

our

funding

costs

have

increased,

as

we

have

had

to 
increase the

rates we

pay to

our depositors

to avoid

losing deposits and

to procure

new ones.

Rising interest

rates have

also led 
customers to move their funds to alternative investments that pay higher

interest rates.

Additionally, periods of market stress or lack 
of market

or customer

confidence in

financial institutions

may result

in a

loss of

customer deposits,

especially to

the extent

those 
deposits are in

excess of the

FDIC-insured limit of

$250,000. As of

December 31, 2024,

we had $13

billion of total

deposits (other 
than collateralized

public funds,

which represent

public deposit

balances from

governmental entities

in the

U.S. and

its territories, 
including Puerto Rico

and the

United States Virgin

Islands, that are

collateralized based on

such jurisdictions’

applicable collateral 
requirements) in excess of the FDIC-insured limit. If deposits decrease, we may need to rely on more expensive sources of funding, 
which

would

negatively

impact

our

interest

rate

margin

and

net

interest

income.

In

addition,

a

reduction

in

our

deposits

would 
decrease our earning assets, which would also

negatively affect our net interest income. 
We have a significant amount of deposits from the Puerto

Rico government, its instrumentalities and municipalities ($19.5 
billion,

or

approximately 30%

of

our

total

deposits, as

of

December 31,

2024),

and

the

amount

of

these

deposits may

fluctuate 
depending on the financial condition and liquidity of these entities, as well as on our ability to maintain these customer relationships. 
Under the terms

of BPPR’s deposit

pricing agreement with the

Puerto Rico government, most

public fund deposit rates

are market 
linked with

a lag

minus a specified

spread.

Therefore, as market

rates rise, we

are required to

sequentially increase the

rates we 
pay

our public

deposits. If

the mix

of our

deposits shifts

towards a

higher proportion

of

higher-cost deposits

for

any reason,

our 
funding costs would increase and our net interest

income would be expected to decrease.

OPERATIONAL RISKS 
We

and our

third-party providers

have been,

and expect

in the

future to

continue to

be, subject

to cyber-attacks,

which 
could cause substantial harm and have an adverse

effect on our business and results of operations. 
Cybersecurity

risks

for

large

financial

institutions

such

as

Popular

have

increased

significantly

in

recent

years

in

part 
because

of

the

proliferation

of

new

technologies,

such

as

mobile

banking,

cloud

hosting,

artificial

intelligence

and

the

ability

to 
conduct instant

financial transactions

anywhere globally,

as well

as due

to geopolitical

conflicts and

the increased

sophistication 
and

activities

of

organized

crime,

hackers,

terrorists,

nation-states,

hacktivists

and

other

parties.

The

risk

of

cyber-attacks

is 
expected to increase with the evolution and emergence

of new technologies such as artificial intelligence

and quantum computing.

In

the

ordinary

course

of

business,

we

rely

on

electronic

communications

and

information

systems

to

conduct

our 
operations

and

to

transmit

and

store

sensitive

data.

Notwithstanding

our

defensive

measures

and

the

significant

resources

we 
devote to protecting the security of our systems, there

is no assurance that all of our security measures

will be effective at all times, 
especially

as

the

threats

from

cyber-attacks

are

continuous

and

severe.

The

risk

of

a

security

breach

due

to

a

cyber-attack

is 
expected to increase as we

continue to expand our mobile

banking and other internet-based product offerings,

the use of the cloud 
for system development and hosting and internal

use of internet-based products and applications. 
We

continue to

detect and

identify attacks

that are

becoming more

sophisticated and

increasing in

volume, as

well as 
attackers

that

respond

rapidly

to

changes

in

defensive

countermeasures. The

most

significant

cyber-attack

risks

that

we

or

our 

27 
critical service providers may face include, but are not limited to, e-fraud,

denial-of-service (DDoS), ransomware, computer intrusion 
and

the

exploitation

of

software

zero-day

vulnerabilities

that

might

result

in

disruption

of

services,

in

the

exposure

or

loss

of 
customer or proprietary data, and

significant financial loss. Loss from

e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems 
or the

systems of

our customers

and extract

funds from

customer’s credit

cards or

bank accounts,

including through

brute force, 
password spraying and

credential stuffing attacks

directed at gaining

unauthorized access to

individual accounts. Denial-of-service 
attacks intentionally

disrupt the

ability of

legitimate users,

including customers

and employees,

to access

networks, websites

and 
online resources. Computer intrusion attempts,

either direct or through social

engineering (pretext calls), supply chain

compromise, 
email,

text

or

voice

messages,

including

using

brand

impersonation

(regularly

referred

to

as

phishing,

vishing,

smishing

and 
quishing), have

resulted in

and may

continue to

result in

the compromise

of sensitive

customer data,

such as

account numbers, 
credit

cards

and

social

security

numbers,

and

could

present

significant

reputational,

legal

and

regulatory

costs

to

Popular

if 
successful.

Our

customer-facing

platforms

are

also

routinely

attacked

by

threat

actors

aiming

to

gain

unauthorized

access

to

our 
clients’

accounts.

Although

we

have

implemented

defensive

measures

designed

to

protect

against

such

attacks,

there

is

no 
assurance that

these

defensive measures

will keep

pace with

threats that

are continuous

and

growing in

severity.

For example, 
certain customers have been affected by brute force attacks on one of

our platforms, which resulted in certain of our customers log-
in

credentials

and

information

being

exposed

and

accounts

being

taken

over,

resulting

in

fraudulent

transfers

or

withdrawals.

Popular

customers have

also

been impacted

by card

skimming

events in

our

ATM

terminals. As

a result,

we have

notified, and 
conducted

additional

remediation

for,

customers

identified

as

affected

by

these

incidents.

Cyber-security

risks

have

also

been 
recently exacerbated

by the

discovery of

zero-day vulnerabilities

in widely

distributed third

party software,

which have

in the

past 
affected and in the future could affect Popular’s or any

of its service provider’s systems, as further

detailed below. 
The

increased

use

of

remote

access

and

third-party

video

conferencing

solutions

to

enable

work-from-home 
arrangements for employees and facilitate

the use of digital

channels by our customers,

has also increased our

exposure to cyber-
attacks, including through the use of deep fakes and brand impersonation.

In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential 
information obtained

by intercepting

signals or

communications from

mobile devices

used by

Popular’s customers

or employees. 
Recent

geopolitical conflicts

have also

exacerbated the

risks related

to

supply-chain compromises

and de-stabilizing

activities of 
nation-state

sponsored

actors.

Although

we

are

regularly

targeted

by

unauthorized

threat-actor

activity,

we

have

not,

to

date, 
experienced any material losses as a result of

cyber-attacks.

A material compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could

have serious negative consequences for us, 
including

significant

disruption

of

our

operations

and

those

of

our

clients,

customers

and

counterparties,

misappropriation

of 
confidential

information

of

Popular

or

that

of

our

clients,

customers,

counterparties

or

employees,

or

damage

to

computers

or 
systems used

by us

or by

our clients,

customers and

counterparties, and

could result

in violations of

applicable privacy

and other 
laws,

financial

loss

to

us

or

to

our

customers,

increased

regulatory

scrutiny

and

enforcement

actions,

customer

dissatisfaction, 
significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation,

all of which could have a material adverse

effect on us.

The

extent

of

a

particular

cyber-attack

and

the

steps

that

we

may

need

to

take

to

investigate

the

attack

may

not

be 
immediately

clear,

and

it

may

take

a

significant

amount

of

time

before

such

an

investigation

can

be

completed.

While

such

an 
investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent

of the harm caused by the cyber-attack, and that

damage 
may continue to spread.

These factors may inhibit

our ability to provide

rapid, full and reliable

information about the cyber-attack to 
our clients,

customers, counterparties

and regulators,

as well

as the

public. Moreover,

new regulations may

require us

to disclose 
information about a cybersecurity event before

it has been resolved or

fully investigated. Furthermore, it may not

be clear how best 
to

contain

and

remediate

the

potential

harm

caused

by

the

cyber-attack,

and

certain

errors

or

actions

could

be

repeated

or 
compounded before they are

discovered and remediated. Cyber-attacks could

also cause interruptions in our

operations and result 
in the incurrence of significant costs, including those related

to forensic analysis and legal counsel.

We also

rely on

third parties

for the

performance of

a significant

portion of

our information

technology functions and

the 
provision of information security,

technology and business process services. As a result, a

successful compromise or circumvention 
of

the security

of

the systems

of these

third-party service

providers could

have serious

negative consequences

for us,

including 
compromise

of

our

systems,

misappropriation of

our

confidential

information

or

that

of

our

clients,

customers,

counterparties

or 
employees, or

other negative

implications identified

above with

respect to

a cyber-attack

on our

systems. The

most important

of 
these

third-party service

providers for

us

is

Evertec. As

a result,

we

depend on

Evertec to

identify and

remediate certain

of

our 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Cyber-attacks at third-party service

providers are also becoming increasingly common, and,

as a result, 
cybersecurity risks relating to our vendors, including Evertec have increased.

Certain risks particular to Evertec and our dependence 
on

third

parties

are

discussed

under

“We

rely

on

other

companies

to

provide

key

components

of

our

business

infrastructure, 

28 
including certain of our core financial transaction processing and

information technology and security services, which exposes us to 
a number

of operational

risks that

could have

a material

adverse effect

on us”

During 2021,

we determined that,

as a

result of

the widely

reported breach of

Accellion, Inc.’s

File Transfer

Appliance 
tool, which

was being

used at

the time

of such

breach by

a U.S.-based

third-party advisory

services vendor

of Popular,

personal 
information

of

certain

Popular

customers

was

compromised.

During

2023,

personal

information of

Popular

customers’

data

was 
compromised

in

a

data

breach

incident

that

impacted

MOVEit,

the

third-party

file

transfer

platform

used

by

one

of

our

service 
providers. In both instances, Popular notified,

as required or otherwise deemed appropriate, customers identified

as affected by the 
incident. Furthermore,

during 2024,

threat actors

exploited a

zero-day vulnerability

in the

Fortinet enterprise

management server 
software

used

by

Evertec,

which

migrated

to

one

of

Popular's

domain

controllers

due

to

a

shared

network

environment.

While 
Evertec determined that

no BPPR customer

information was exfiltrated

as a result

of this incident,

the event

underscores the risks 
inherent

in

Popular’s

dependency

on

Evertec.

Although

these

incidents

did

not

have

a

material

effect

on

Popular,

including

its 
business

strategy,

results

of

operations

or

financial

condition,

and

our

third-party

service

providers

agreed

to

cover

external 
remediation

costs

associated

therewith,

a

compromise

of

Popular

information

or

the

personal

information

of

our

customers 
maintained by third party

vendors could result in significant

regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial

loss to us. 
The success

of our

business depends in

part on the

continuing ability of

these (and

other) third

parties to perform

these functions 
and

services

in

a

timely

and

satisfactory manner,

which performance

could

be

disrupted or

otherwise adversely

affected

due

to 
failures

or

other information

security

events originating

at

the

third parties

or

at

the third

parties’ suppliers

or

vendors

(so-called 
“fourth party risk”). We may not be able to effectively directly monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use 
of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties

that perform functions and services for us. 

As cyber

threats continue

to evolve,

we also

expect to

expend significant

additional resources

to continue

to modify

or 
enhance

our

layers

of

defense

or

to

investigate

and

remediate

additional

information

security

vulnerabilities

or

incidents.

The 
obsolescence

in

our

hardware

or

software

limits

our

ability

to

mitigate

vulnerabilities.

System

enhancements and

updates

also 
create

risks

associated

with

implementing new

systems

and

integrating

them

with

existing

ones,

including

risks

associated

with 
supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers. In

addition, 
addressing certain

information security

vulnerabilities, such

as hardware-based

vulnerabilities, may

affect

the performance

of our 
information

technology

systems.

The

ability

of

our

hardware

and

software

providers

to

deliver

patches

and

updates

to

mitigate 
vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce

additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively

exploited by threat 
actors.

Moreover,

our

efforts

to

timely

mitigate

vulnerabilities

and

manage

such

risks,

given

the

rise

in

number

and

urgency

of 
required patches and third-party software, as well as

the obsolescence in some of our hardware and

software, may impact our day-
to-day operations, the availability of our systems and

delay the deployment of technology enhancements

and innovation.

If Popular’s operational systems,

or those of

external parties on which

Popular’s businesses depend, are

unable to meet 
the requirements of our

businesses and operations or bank

regulatory standards, or if they

fail, have other significant

shortcomings 
or are impacted by cyber-attacks, Popular could

be materially and adversely affected. 
Unforeseen or

catastrophic events,

including

extreme weather

events and

other natural

disasters, man-made

disasters, 
acts of violence or

war, or the

emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could

cause a disruption in our

operations or other 
consequences that could have a material adverse

effect on our financial condition and results

of operations. 
A
significant

portion

of

our

operations

are

located

in

the

Caribbean

and

Florida,

a

region

susceptible

to

hurricanes, 
earthquakes and other

similar events. In

2017, Puerto Rico,

USVI and BVI

were severely impacted

by Hurricanes Irma

and María, 
which resulted in significant disruption to our operations and adversely affected

our clients in these markets, and in 2022, Hurricane 
Fiona impacted the

southwest area of

Puerto Rico,

adversely affecting our

customers in

that region. Other

types of

unforeseen or 
catastrophic events, including

pandemics, epidemics, man-made

disasters, or acts

of violence or

war, or

the fear that

such events 
could occur

in the

future, could

also adversely

impact our

operations and

financial results.

For example,

in 2020,

the COVID-19 
pandemic

severely

impacted

global

health,

financial

markets,

consumer

spending

and

global

economic

conditions,

and

caused 
significant disruption to businesses

worldwide, including our business

and those of

our customers, service providers

and suppliers. 
Future unforeseen or catastrophic events, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to such 
events, could

adversely affect

our operations,

cause economic

and market

disruption, adversely

impact the

ability of

borrowers to 
timely repay

their loans,

or affect

the value

of any

collateral held

by us,

any of

which could

have a

material adverse

effect on

our 
business, financial condition or results of operations. The frequency, severity and impact of future unforeseen or catastrophic events 
is

difficult

to

predict. While

we maintain

insurance against

natural disasters

and

other unforeseen

events, including

coverage

for 
business interruption, the insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage from any such event, and there is

no insurance 
against the

disruption that

a catastrophic

event could

produce to

the markets

that we

serve and

the potential

negative impact

to 
economic activity. 

29 
Climate change could have a material adverse

impact on our business operations and that

of our clients and customers. 
Our business and

the activities and

operations of our

clients and customers

may be disrupted

by global climate

change. 
Potential physical risks

from climate change

include the increase

in the

frequency and severity

of weather

events, such as

storms 
and

hurricanes,

and

long-term

shifts

in

climate

patterns, such

as

sustained

higher

and

lower

temperatures,

sea

level

rise,

heat 
waves

and

droughts,

among

others.

Our

geographic

concentration

in

localities,

including

Puerto

Rico,

the

U.S.V.I.,

B.V.I.

and 
Florida, particularly

susceptible to

risks arising

from climate

change, including

severe hurricanes

and sea

level rise,

heighten the 
threat we

face from

climate change. Additionally,

the impact

of climate

change in

the markets

that we

operate and

in other

global 
markets may

have the

effect of

increasing the

costs or

reducing the

availability of

insurance needed

for our

business operations. 
Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy.

These transition risks may include 
changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to 
mitigate the

effects

of climate

change. Changes

in the

legal

and regulatory

landscape may

additionally increase

our compliance 
costs.

These

climate-driven

changes

could

have

a

material

adverse

impact

on

asset

values

and

on

our

business

and

financial 
performance and those of our clients and customers. 
We

rely

on

other

companies

to

provide

key

components

of

our

business

infrastructure,

including

certain

of

our

core 
financial

transaction

processing

and

information

technology

and

security

services,

which

exposes

us

to

a

number

of 
operational risks that could have a material

adverse effect on us. 
Third parties provide key components of our business operations, such

as data processing, information security, recording 
and monitoring transactions,

online banking interfaces and

services, Internet connections and

network access. The most

important 
of these

third-party service providers

for us

is Evertec. We

are dependent on

Evertec for

the provision of

essential services to

our 
business, including certain of our core financial transaction

processing and information technology and

security services. As a result, 
we

are

particularly

exposed

to

the

operational

risks

of

Evertec,

including

those

related

to

its

security

architecture

and

potential 
breakdowns or failures of Evertec’s systems or internal

controls environment.

Over the

course of our

relationship with Evertec,

we have experienced

interruptions and delays

in key

services provided 
by Evertec, as well as cyber events, as a result of system breakdowns, their exposure to zero-day vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, 
human

error,

application

obsolescence

and

dependency

on

shared

infrastructure

components

and

shared

environments,

which 
have in certain cases also

led to exposure of Popular information

and BPPR customer information. In particular,

the current level of 
obsolescence in the hardware and

software used by Evertec

to service us exposes

us to heightened operational and

cybersecurity 
risks, including system outages.

Our ability to cure

legacy obsolescence in the

hardware and software we

procure from Evertec, to 
expand

our

oversight

over

security

services

being

provided

by

Evertec,

as

well

as

to

effect

the

segregation

of

our

shared 
infrastructure,

is

expected

to

be

lengthy

and

complex,

which

exacerbates

our

exposure

to

resulting

operational,

including 
cybersecurity,

risks. See

“The transition

to new

financial services

technology providers,

and the

replacement of

services currently 
provided to us by Evertec, will be lengthy and

complex” in the Operational Risks section of Item 1A

in this Form 10-K below.

While

we

select

third-party vendors

carefully

and

have

increased our

oversight

of

these

relationships, our

oversight is 
constrained by

the level

of our

ongoing visibility into

our vendor’s systems

and operations, and

we do not

have direct control

over 
their actions, assets

or services. Any

problems caused by

these vendors, including

those resulting from

disruptions in the

services 
provided, vulnerabilities

in or

breaches of

the vendor’s

systems or

environments, failure

of the

vendor to

handle current

or higher 
volumes, failure of the vendor to provide services for any reason

or poor performance of services, failure of the vendor to notify

us of 
a

reportable

event

in

a

timely

manner,

our

vendors’

misuse

of

artificial

intelligence

and

other

automatic

decision

making 
technologies,

could

adversely

affect

our

ability

to

deliver

products

and

services

to

our

customers

and

otherwise

conduct

our 
business, disrupt

our operations,

result in

potential liability

to clients

and customers,

result in

the imposition

of fines,

penalties or 
judgments by

our regulators,

lead to

exposure of

our information

or that

of our

customers or

harm to

our reputation,

any of

which 
could materially and adversely affect us. The inability of our third-party service providers to timely address cybersecurity threats

may 
further

exacerbate these

risks.

Financial

or

operational difficulties

of

a

third-party

vendor

could

also

hurt

our

operations if

those 
difficulties

interfere

with

the

vendor’s

ability

to

serve

us.

Replacing

these

third-party

vendors,

when

possible,

could

also

create 
significant delay and expense. Accordingly, the use of third parties creates an

unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. 
The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided to

us by 
Evertec, will be lengthy and complex. 
Switching from

one vendor

of core

bank processing

and related

technology and

security services

to

one

or more

new 
vendors

is

a

complex

process

that

carries

business

and

financial

risks.

The

implementation

cycle

for

such

a

transition

can

be 
lengthy and

require significant

financial and

management resources

from us.

Such a

transition can

also increase

costs (including 

30 
conversion costs)

and expose

us and

our clients

to business

disruption, as

well as

operational and

cybersecurity risks.

Upon the 
transition of all

or a portion

of existing services

provided by Evertec to

new financial services technology

providers, either (i)

at the 
end of the term of the Second Amended and Restated

Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) and related

agreements or (ii) earlier 
upon the

termination of any

service for

convenience under the

MSA, these transition

risks could result

in an

adverse effect

on our 
business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Evertec

has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to

us in 
connection with

the termination of

the MSA,

we are

ultimately dependent on

their ability

to provide

those services

in a

responsive 
and competent manner,

as well as to

retain experienced personnel to provide

the services. Furthermore, we may

require transition 
assistance from

Evertec beyond

the term

of the

MSA, delaying

and lengthening

any transition

process away

from Evertec

while 
increasing related costs. 

Under the

MSA, we

are able

to terminate

services for

convenience with

180 days’

prior notice.

We expect

to exercise 
during the

term of

the MSA

the right

to terminate

certain services

for convenience

and to

transition such

services to

other service 
providers prior to the expiration

of the MSA, subject to

complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in

the MSA and certain 
other conditions. In

practice, in order

to switch

to a

new provider for

a particular service,

we will have

to commence procuring

and 
working on

a transition

process for

such service

significantly in

advance of

its termination

and, in

any case,

much earlier

than the 
automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of

the MSA, and such process may extend beyond the current

term of the MSA. 
Furthermore, if

we

are

unsuccessful or

decide not

to

complete

the transition

after

expending significant

funds

and

management 
resources, it could also result in an adverse

effect on our business, financial condition and results

of operations. 
LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 
Our

businesses

are

highly

regulated,

and

the

laws

and

regulations

that

apply

to

us

have

a

significant

impact

on

our 
business and operations. 
We are subject to extensive and evolving regulation

under U.S. federal, state and Puerto Rico laws

that govern almost all 
aspects of our operations and limit the businesses

in which we may be engaged, including

regulation, supervision and examination 
by federal, state and foreign banking authorities.

These laws and regulations have expanded

significantly over an extended period 
of time and are primarily intended for the protection

of consumers, borrowers and depositors. Compliance

with these laws and 
regulations has resulted, and will continue to

result, in significant costs. Additionally, the new federal administration is pursuing

a 
regulatory agenda significantly different from that of the

previous administration, including the possible

reversal of rules promulgated 
under the past administration and shifts in rulemaking,

supervision, examination and enforcement priorities.

The implementation of 
that agenda is happening rapidly and is constantly

evolving. The potential impact of any such changes

cannot be predicted at this 
time.
Additional

laws

and

regulations

may

be

enacted

or

adopted

in

the

future,

and

the

application,

interpretation

or 
enforcement

of

laws

and

regulations

may

in

the

future

be

changed

(including

through

executive

orders),

in

ways

that

could 
significantly affect

our powers,

authority and

operations and

which could

have a

material adverse

effect on

our financial

condition 
and

results

of

operations. In

particular,

we

could

be

adversely impacted

by

changes

in

laws

and

regulations,

or changes

in

the 
application, interpretation

or enforcement

of laws

and regulations,

that proscribe

or institute

more stringent

restrictions on

certain 
financial

services

activities, impose

monetary fines

or

other

penalties on

institutions that

fail

to

comply

with

applicable laws

and 
regulations, or

impose new

requirements relating

to the

impact of

business activities

on ESG

concerns, the

management of

risks 
associated

with

those

concerns

and

the

extent

to

which

ESG-related

objectives

are

taken

into

account

in

financing

and

other 
business activities and decision-making, such as

the offering of products intended

to achieve ESG-related objectives. For example, 
certain

states

have

enacted,

or

have

proposed

to

enact,

statutes

that

prohibit

financial

institutions

from

denying

or

canceling 
products or services to a person, or otherwise discriminating against a person in making available products or services, on the basis 
of social

credit scores

and certain

other factors.

In addition,

new laws

or regulations

could require

significant system

and process 
changes that require systems upgrades and could limit our ability to meet adoption timeframes or pursue our innovation

roadmap. If 
we do

not appropriately

comply with

current or

future laws

or regulations,

adapt to

the changing

interpretation of

existing laws

or 
regulations,

or

if

we

fail

to

meet

supervisory

expectations,

we

may

be

subject

to

fines,

penalties

or

judgements,

or

to

material 
regulatory restrictions on

our business, which could

also materially and

adversely affect our

business,

financial condition, liquidity, 
results of operations or capital position. 
In 2023, the federal

banking regulators proposed revisions to the

U.S. capital rules and new

long-term debt requirements 
for banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets.

Higher capital requirements or new long-term debt requirements

could 
increase interest

and noninterest

expense for

banking organizations

subject to

those requirements.

In addition,

during 2023,

the 
federal banking regulators indicated that they are considering

revisions to liquidity requirements applicable to banking organizations 
with $100 billion or more in light of

the failures of three large banks in March and

May 2023.

Any such revisions could require large 

31 
banks to change

the size and

composition of their

liquidity portfolios, which

could have adverse

effects on net

interest income and 
net interest margin.

These proposals

and anticipated

proposals reflect

a trend

of increasingly

stringent regulatory

requirements for

banking 
organizations

with assets

of

$100

billion

or

more,

relative

to

smaller

banking

organizations, as

well

as

less differentiation

in

the 
requirements applicable among banking organizations with $100 billion or more in assets.

Although Popular currently has less than 
$100

billion

in

assets,

actual, anticipated

or

potential changes

in

regulatory requirements

for

banking organizations

with at

least 
$100 billion in assets could

result in Popular deciding not to

pursue growth opportunities that would result

in its assets approaching 
or exceeding

that threshold,

or if

Popular’s assets

do exceed

that threshold,

a need

for Popular

to increase

its regulatory

capital, 
issue

substantial

amounts

of

long-term

debt

or

incur

other

significant

expenses

in

order

to

satisfy

applicable

regulatory 
requirements. 
Our participation

(or lack

of participation)

in certain

governmental programs,

such as

the Paycheck

Protection Program 
(“PPP”) enacted

in response

to the

COVID-19 pandemic,

also exposes

us to

increased legal

and regulatory

risks. We

have also 
been and could continue to

be exposed to adverse

action for the violation of

applicable legal requirements or the improper

conduct 
of our employees in connection with such loans. For example, on January 24, 2023, Popular Bank consented to the imposition of an 
order from

the Federal

Reserve Board

requiring it

to

pay a

$2.3 million

civil money

penalty to

settle certain

findings arising

from 
Popular Bank’s approval of six Payment Protection Program

loans.

We

are from

time to

time subject

to information

requests, investigations

and other

regulatory enforcement

proceedings 
from departments and agencies of the U.S. and

Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate

compliance with 
U.S. sanctions and consumer protection laws and regulations, which may

expose us to significant penalties and collateral 
consequences, and could result in higher compliance

costs or restrictions on our operations. 
We

from

time-to-time

self-report

compliance

matters

to,

or

receive

requests

for

information

from,

departments

and 
agencies

of

the

U.S.

and

Puerto

Rico

governments,

including

with

respect

to

compliance

with

consumer

protection

laws

and 
regulations.

For

example,

BPPR

has

in

the

past

received

requests

for

information,

such

as

subpoenas

and

civil

investigative 
demands

from

U.S.

government

regulators,

including

concerning

add-ons

on

consumer

products,

real

estate

appraisals

and 
residential and

construction loans

in Puerto

Rico. BPPR

has also

self-identified and

reported to

applicable regulators

compliance 
matters related to U.S. sanctions, as well as mortgage,

credit reporting and other consumer lending practices.

Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities have resulted in the past, and may 
in the

future result, in

judgments, settlements, fines,

enforcement actions, penalties

or other sanctions

adverse to the

Corporation, 
which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation’s business, financial

condition, results of operations or capital position or 
cause serious reputational harm. Any such settlements or orders

that we enter into, or that regulatory authorities impose

on us could 
require enhancements to our

procedures and controls and

entail significant operational and

compliance costs. Furthermore, issues 
or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory settlement or

action on a timely basis could result in additional

penalties and 
enforcement actions, which could be significant. In connection with the resolution of regulatory proceedings, enforcement authorities 
may seek admissions of wrongdoing and, in some cases, criminal pleas, which

could lead to increased exposure to private litigation, 
loss of clients or customers, and restrictions on offering certain products or

services. In addition, responding to information-gathering 
requests,

investigations

and

other

regulatory

proceedings,

regardless

of

the

ultimate

outcome

of

the

matter,

could

be

time-
consuming, expensive and divert management attention

from our business.

Financial services

institutions such

as Popular

have been

subject to

heightened expectations

and regulatory

scrutiny in 
recent years.

Our regulators’

oversight is

not limited

to banking

and financial

services laws

but extends

to other

significant laws 
such as those related to anti

money laundering, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Further,

regulators in the performance of their 
supervisory and enforcement

duties, have significant

discretion and power

to prevent or

remedy what they

deem to be

unsafe and 
unsound

practices

or

violations

of

laws

by

banks

and

bank

holding

companies.

Therefore,

the

outcome

of

any

investigative

or 
enforcement action, which may take years and be

material to Popular, may be difficult to predict or estimate.

Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs

and anti-money laundering laws and regulations

can increase our 
operational

and

compliance

costs

and

risks.

If

we,

and

our

subsidiaries,

affiliates

or

third-party

service

providers,

are 
found to

have failed

to comply

with applicable

economic and

trade sanctions

programs and

anti-money laundering

laws 
and

regulations,

we

could

be

exposed

to

fines,

sanctions

and

penalties,

and

other

regulatory

actions,

as

well

as 
governmental investigations.

32 
As

a

federally

regulated

financial

institution,

we

must

comply

with

regulations

and

economic

and

trade

sanctions

and 
embargo

programs

administered by

the

Office

of

Foreign

Assets

Control

(“OFAC”)

of

the

U.S.

Treasury,

as

well

as

anti-money 
laundering laws and regulations, including those under

the Bank Secrecy Act. 
Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering 
into or facilitating

unlicensed transactions with, for

the benefit of,

or in some

cases involving the

property and property interests

of, 
persons,

governments or

countries

designated by

the

U.S.

government under

one

or

more

sanctions

regimes,

and

also

prohibit 
transactions

that

provide

a

benefit

that

is

received in

a

country

designated

under

one

or

more

sanctions

regimes.

We

are

also 
subject to

a variety

of reporting

and other

requirements under

the Bank

Secrecy Act,

including the

requirement to

file suspicious 
activity and currency

transaction reports, that

are designed to

assist in

the detection

and prevention of

money laundering, terrorist 
financing

and

other

criminal

activities.

In

addition,

as

a

financial

institution

we

are

required

to,

among

other

things,

identify

our 
customers, adopt formal

and comprehensive anti-money

laundering programs, scrutinize

or altogether prohibit

certain transactions 
of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S.

law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and

their 
transactions. Failure

by the

Corporation, its

subsidiaries, affiliates

or

third-party service

providers to

comply with

these

laws

and 
regulations

could

have

serious

legal

and

reputational

consequences

for

the

Corporation,

including

the

possibility

of

regulatory 
enforcement

or

other

legal

action,

including

significant

civil

and

criminal

penalties.

We

also

incur

higher

costs

and

face

greater 
compliance risks in

structuring and operating

our businesses to comply

with these requirements. The

markets in which

we operate 
heighten these costs and risks. 
We have established risk-based policies and procedures and employed software designed to

assist us and our personnel 
in complying

with these

applicable laws

and regulations.

Even if

the appropriate

controls are

in place,

there can

be no

assurance 
that

our

policies

and

procedures will

prevent

us

from

blocking

and

rejecting

all

applicable

transactions

of

our

customers

or

our 
customers’ customers

that may

involve a

sanctioned person,

government or

country.

Any failure

to detect

and prevent

any such 
transaction

could

result

in

a

violation

of

applicable

laws

and

regulations

and

adversely

affect

our

reputation,

business,

financial 
condition and results of operations. 
From time

to time

we have

identified and

voluntarily self-disclosed

to OFAC

transactions that

were not

timely identified, 
blocked

or

rejected

by

our

policies,

controls

and

procedures

for

screening

transactions

that

might

violate

the

regulations

and 
economic and

trade sanctions

programs administered

by OFAC.

For example,

during the

second quarter

of 2022,

BPPR entered 
into

a

settlement

agreement

with

OFAC

with

respect

to

certain

transactions

processed

on

behalf

of

two

employees

of

the 
Government

of

Venezuela,

in

apparent

violation

of

U.S.

sanctions

against

Venezuela.

Popular

agreed

to

pay

approximately 
$256,000 to settle the

apparent violations, which had been

self-disclosed to OFAC.

There can be no

assurances that any failure

to 
comply with

U.S. sanctions

and embargoes,

or

with anti-money

laundering laws

and

regulations, will

not result

in material

fines, 
sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. 
Furthermore, if

the policies,

controls, and

procedures of

one of

the Corporation’s

third-party service

providers, together 
with our

third-party oversight

of such

providers, do

not prevent

it from

violating applicable

laws and

regulations in

transactions in 
which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its

ability to provide services to us.

We are

subject to

regulatory capital

adequacy requirements, and

if we

fail to

meet these

requirements our

business and 
financial condition will be adversely affected. 
Under regulatory capital adequacy requirements, and other

regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking

subsidiaries 
must

meet

requirements

that

include

quantitative

measures

of

assets,

liabilities

and

certain

off-balance

sheet

items,

subject

to 
qualitative

judgments

by

regulators

regarding

components,

risk

weightings

and

other

factors.

If

we

fail

to

meet

these

minimum 
capital

requirements

and

other

regulatory

requirements,

our

business

and

financial

condition

will

be

materially

and

adversely 
affected. If

a financial

holding company

fails to

maintain well-capitalized

status under

the regulatory

framework, or

is deemed

not 
well managed

under regulatory

exam procedures, or

if it

experiences certain

regulatory violations, its

status as

a financial

holding 
company and its

related eligibility for

a streamlined review

process for acquisition

proposals, and its

ability to offer

certain financial 
products, may be

compromised and its

financial condition and

results of operations

could be adversely

affected. The failure

of any 
depository

institution

subsidiary

of

a

financial

holding

company

to

maintain

well-capitalized

or

well-managed

status

could

have 
similar consequences.

In

addition, federal

regulators

have proposed

revisions to

increase capital

requirements for

banking organizations

with 
$100 billion or more in assets. If adopted, such standards may in the future affect us. See “Our businesses are highly regulated, and 
the laws

and regulations

that apply

to us

have a

significant impact

on our

business and

operations” in

the Legal

and Regulatory 
Risks section of Item 1A in this Form 10-K.

Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may

have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 
Substantially

all

the

deposits

of

BPPR

and

PB

are

subject

to

insurance

up

to

applicable

limits

by

the

FDIC’s

deposit 
insurance fund

(“DIF”) and, as

a result, BPPR

and PB

are subject to

FDIC deposit

insurance assessments. On

October 18, 2022, 
the FDIC

finalized a

rule that

increased initial

base deposit

insurance assessment

rates by

2 basis

points, beginning

with the

first 
quarterly assessment period of 2023. In addition, in November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to 
recover the costs to the DIF resulting from the FDIC’s

use, in March 2023, of the systemic risk exception to

the least-cost resolution 
test

under

the

FDIA

in

connection

with

the

receiverships

of

Silicon

Valley

Bank

and

Signature

Bank.

The

exact

amount

of

this 
assessment will be determined when the FDIC terminates

the related receiverships considered in the final

rule. Accordingly, the final 
special assessment

amount and collection

period may change

as the

estimated cost

is periodically adjusted

or if

the total

amount 
collected varies.

For example,

in June

2024, due

to an

increased estimate of

losses, the

FDIC announced that

it projects

that the 
special assessment will be collected for an additional

two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter

collection period, at a lower rate. 
We

are generally

unable to

control the

amount of

premiums or

additional assessments

that we

are required

to pay

for 
FDIC insurance. If there

are additional bank or financial

institution failures, our level of

non-performing assets increases, or our

risk 
profile changes

or our

capital position

is impaired,

we may

be required

to pay

even higher

FDIC premiums.

Any future

additional 
increases in

FDIC premiums,

assessment rates

or special

assessments may

materially adversely

affect our

results of

operations.

and Regulation—FDIC Insurance” discussion
