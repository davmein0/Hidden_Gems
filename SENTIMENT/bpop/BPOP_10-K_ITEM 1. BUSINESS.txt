ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General: 
Popular

is

a diversified,

publicly-owned financial

holding company,

registered under

the Bank

Holding Company

Act

of

1956, as 
amended (the “BHC Act”), and subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 
“Federal Reserve Board”). Popular was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and is the

largest 
financial institution

based in Puerto

Rico, with

consolidated assets of

$73.0 billion, total

deposits of

$64.9 billion

and stockholders’ 
equity of $5.6 billion at

December 31, 2024. At December 31,

2024, we ranked among the

50 largest U.S. bank holding companies 
based on total assets according to information gathered

and disclosed by the Federal Reserve Board. 
We operate in two principal markets: 
●

Puerto Rico:

We

provide retail,

mortgage and

commercial banking

services through

our principal

banking subsidiary,

Banco 
Popular de Puerto Rico

(“Banco Popular” or “BPPR”), as

well as auto and equipment

leasing and financing, broker-dealer and 
insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. BPPR’s deposits are

insured under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of 
the

Federal

Deposit

Insurance

Corporation (“FDIC”).

The

banking

operations

of

BPPR

are

primarily

based

in

Puerto

Rico, 
where BPPR has the largest retail banking franchise. 
●

Mainland

United

States:

We

provide

retail,

mortgage

and

commercial

banking

services

through

our

New

York-chartered 
banking subsidiary,

Popular Bank (“PB” or

“Popular U.S.”), which has

branches in New York,

New Jersey and Florida;

as well 
as investment and

insurance services, and commercial

direct financing leases through

specialized subsidiaries. PB’s deposits 
are insured under the DIF of the FDIC. 
●

BPPR

also

conducts

banking

operations

in

the

U.S.

Virgin

Islands,

the

British

Virgin

Islands

and

New

York.

In

addition

to 
BPPR’s commercial

banking operations

in New

York

that include

direct loan

origination and

participating loans

originated by 
PB,

BPPR

offers

or

holds

financial

products

on

a

National

scale

in

the

U.S.

market,

including

personal

loans

previously 
originated under

the E-Loan

brand, purchased

personal loans

originated by

third parties,

and

gathering insured

institutional 
deposits via online deposit gathering platforms. In the U.S. and British

Virgin Islands, BPPR offers a range of banking products, 
including loans and deposits to both retail and

commercial customers. 
For further information about the Corporation’s results segregated by

its reportable segments, see “Reportable Segment Results” in 
the Management’s Discussion

and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results

of Operations section (“MD&A”)

and Note 36

to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this

Form 10-K. 
Lending Activities 
We concentrate our lending activities in the following areas: 
(1) Commercial. Commercial loans are comprised of (i) commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans and leases to commercial

customers 
for use in normal

business operations and to finance

working capital needs, equipment purchases or

other projects, (ii) commercial 
real

estate

(“CRE”)

loans

(excluding

construction

loans)

for

income-producing real

estate

properties

as

well

as

owner-occupied 
properties,

and (iii)

multifamily loans with

residential buildings with

five or

more living

units. C&I loans

are underwritten individually 
and usually secured with the assets of the company and

the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE

loans consist of loans 
for income-producing

real estate

properties and

the financing

of owner-occupied

facilities if

there is

real estate

as collateral.

Non-
owner-occupied CRE

loans are

generally made

to finance

office and

industrial buildings,

healthcare facilities,

and retail

shopping 
centers and are

repaid through cash

flows related to

the operation, sale

or refinancing of

the property.

Multifamily loans, in

certain 
cases, result from the conversion of the

Bank’s construction financing to permanent financing and are repaid

through the cash flow, 
sale or refinance of the properties. 

8 
(2) Mortgage. Mortgage

loans include residential

mortgage loans to

consumers for the

purchase or refinancing

of a

residence and 
also include residential construction loans made

to individuals for the construction of refurbishment

of their residence.

(3) Consumer.

Consumer loans

are mainly

comprised of

unsecured personal

loans, credit

cards, and

automobile loans,

and to

a 
lesser extent home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”)

and other loans made by banks to individual

borrowers.

(4) Construction. Construction loans are CRE loans to companies,

community or homeowners’ associations, or developers used for 
the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of 
the property.

Our construction loan

portfolio primarily consists

of retail, residential

(land and condominiums),

office and warehouse 
product types.

(5) Lease Financings. Lease financings are offered by

BPPR and are primarily comprised of automobile loans/leases made through 
automotive dealerships. 
Business Concentration 
Since our

business activities

are currently concentrated

primarily in

Puerto Rico,

our results

of operations

and financial 
condition are dependent upon the general trends of

the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular,

the residential and commercial real 
estate markets. The concentration of our

operations in Puerto Rico exposes us

to greater risk than other

banking companies with a 
wider

geographic

base.

Our

asset

and

revenue

composition

by

geographical

area

is

presented

in

Note

36

to

the

Consolidated 
Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. 
Our loan portfolio is diversified by loan category.

However, approximately 55% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2024 consisted 
of real estate-related

loans, including residential

mortgage loans, construction

loans and commercial

loans secured by

commercial 
real estate. The table below presents the distribution

Except for the Corporation’s exposure to the Puerto Rico and U.S. Governments, no individual or single group of related accounts is 
considered material

in relation

to our

total assets

or deposits,

or in

relation to

our overall

business.

For a

discussion of

our loan, 
investment,

and

deposits

portfolios

and

our

exposure

to

the

Government

of

Puerto

Rico,

see

“Financial

Condition

–

Loans”, 
“Financial Condition – Deposits” and “Credit Risk – Geographical and Government Risk” in the MD&A and to Note 23 - Commitment 
and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements

included in this Form 10-K. 
Credit

Administration

and

Credit

Policies
Interest

from our

loan portfolios

is our

principal source

of revenue.

Whenever we

make loans,

we expose

ourselves

to 

9 
credit

risk.

Credit

risk

is

controlled

and

monitored

through

active

asset

quality

management,

including

the

use

of

lending 
standards,

thorough

review

of

potential

borrowers

and through

active

asset quality

administration. 
Business

activities

that

expose

us to

credit

risk are

managed

within

the

Board

of Director’s

Risk Management policy, 
and the Credit Risk Tolerance

Limits policy,

which establishes

limits

that

consider

factors

such

as maintainin

g

a prudent

balance 
of risk-taking

across

diversified

risk types

and business

units,

compliance

with regulator

y

guidance,

and

controlling

the

exposure 
to lower

credit

quality

assets. 
We maintain

comprehensive

credit policies

for all lines of

business in order

to mitigate credit

risk. Our credit

policies

are 
approved by

our Board

of Directors.

These policies set

forth,

among

other

things, 
the objectives, scope and

responsibilities of the 
credit

management cycle.

Our

internal

written

procedures

establish 
underwriting

standards

and

procedures

for

monitoring

and 
evaluating

loan

portfolio

quality

and

require

prompt

identificatio

n

and

quantificatio

n

of

asset

quality

deterioration

or

potential 
loss 
to provide for the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These written procedures establish various approval and lending 
limit levels,

ranging

from

bank

branch

or departmen

t

officers

to managerial

and senior

management

levels.

Approval

levels

are
primarily

determined

by the

amount, type

of loan and

risk characteristics

of the credit

facility. 
Our

credit

policies

and

procedures

establish

documentation

requirements

for

each

loan

and

related

collateral

type, 
when

applicable,

during

the

underwriting,

closing

and

monitoring

phases.

For

commercial

and

construction

loans,

during

the 
initial

loan

underwriting

process,

the

credit

policies

require,

at

a

minimum,

historical

financial

statements

or

tax

returns

of

the 
borrower,

an analysis

of financial

information

contained

in

a

credit

approval

package,

a

risk

rating

determination

and

reports 
from

credit

agencies

and appraisal

s

for

real

estate-related

loans when applicable

.

The credit

policies

also

set

forth

the

required 
closing

documentation

depending

on the

loan

and the

collateral

type. 
Although

we originat

e

most

of our

loans

internally

in both

the

Puerto

Rico

and mainlan

d

United

States

markets,

we 
occasionally

purchase

or

participate

in

loans

originated

by

other

financial

institutions.

When

we

purchase

or

participate

in 
loans

originated

by

others,

we

conduct

the

same

underwriting

analysis

of

the borrower

s

and apply

the

same

criteria

as we do 
for

loans

originated

by us. This also

includes

a review

of the

applicable

legal

documentation.

Refer

to

the

Credit

Risk

section

of

the

MD&A

included

in

this

Form

10-K

for

information

related

to

management 
committees and divisions with responsibilities for establishing

policies and monitoring the Corporation’s credit risk. 
Loan

extensions

,

renewals

and restructurings
Loans with

satisfactory

credit profiles

can be

extended, renewed

or restructured

.

Some commercia

l

loan facilities

are 
structured

as lines

of credit, which

are mainly

one year

in term

and therefore

are required

to be renewed

annually.

Other

facilities 
may be restructure

d

or extended

from time

to time based

upon changes

in the

borrower’s

business

needs,

use

of

funds,

timing 
of

completion

of

projects

and

other

factors.

If

the

borrower

is

not

deemed

to

have

financial

difficulties

,

extensions,

renewals 
and restructurings

are done

in the

normal

course

of busines

s

and the

loans

continue

to be recorde

d

as performing. 
We

evaluate

various

factors

to

determine

if

a

borrower

is

experiencing

financial

difficulties.

Indicators

that

the 
borrower

is

experiencing

financial difficultie

s

include,

for example:

(i)

the borrower

is currently

in default on

any of its debt

or it is 
probable tha

t

the borrower

would be

in payment

default on

any of

its debt

in th

e

foreseeable

future

without

the modification

;

(ii)

the

borrower

has declare

d

or is in

the

process

of declarin

g

bankruptcy;

(iii)

there

is significan

t

doubt

as to

whether

the

borrower 
will

continue

to

be

a

going

concern;

(iv)

the

borrower

has

securities

that

have

been

delisted,

are

in

the

process

of

being 
delisted,

or

are

under threa

t

of bein

g

delisted

from

an exchange

;

(v) based

on estimates

and projection

s

that

only

encompass 
the

current

business

capabilities

,

the

borrower

forecasts

that

its

entity-specifi

c

cash

flows

will

be

insufficien

t

to

service

the 
debt

(both

interest

and

principal)

in

accordance

with

the

contractual

terms

of

the

existing

agreement

through

maturity;

and 
(vi)

absent

the

current

modification,

the

borrower

cannot

obtain

funds

from

sources

other

than

the

existing

creditors

at

an 
effective

interest

rate

equal to the current market

interest

rate for similar

debt for a non-troubled

debtor. 
We

have

specialized

workout

officers

who

handle

the majority

of

commercial

loans

that

are

past

due

90

days

and 
over,

borrowers

experiencing

financial

difficulties

,

and loans

that

are considered

problem loans

based on

their risk

profile. As

a 
general

policy,

we

do

not

advance

additional

money

to

borrowers

who

have

loans

that

are

90

days

past

due

or

over.

In 
commercial

and

construction

loans,

certain

exceptions

may

be approved

under

certain

circumstances,

including

(i) when

past 

10 
due

status

is administrativ

e

in nature,

such

as expiration

of a loan

facility

before

the

new documentatio

n

is executed,

and not as 
a result

of paymen

t

or credit

issues;

(ii) to

improve

our collateral

position

or

otherwise

maximize

recovery

or

mitigate

potential 
future

losses;

and

(iii)

with

respect

to

certain

entities

that,

although

related

through

common

ownership,

are

not

cross 
defaulted

nor

cross-collateralized

and

are

performing

satisfactorily

under

their

respective

loan

facilities.

Such

advances

are 
underwritten

and

approved

following

our

credit

policy

guidelines

and

limits,

which

are

dependent

on

the

borrower’s

financial 
condition,

collateral

and guarantee,

among

others. 
In addition

to the legal

lending limit

established under

applicable

state banking

law, discusse

d

in detail

below,

business 
activities

that

expose the

Corporation to

credit

risk

are managed

within

guidelines described

in the

Credit

Risk Tolerance

Limits 
policy.

Limits are defined for

loss and credit

performance metrics, portfolio composition and

concentration, and industry and

name-
level, 
which 
monitors

lending

concentration

to

a

single

borrower

or

a

group

of

related

borrowers,

including

specific

lending 
limits

based

on industr

y

or other

criteria,

such

as a percentage

of the

banks’

capital. 
Refer to Note 2 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included

in this Form 10-K, for additional information 
on loan modifications to borrowers with financial difficulties. 
Competition
The

financial

services

industry

in

which

we

operate

is

highly

competitive.

In

Puerto

Rico,

our

primary

market,

the 
banking

business

is

highly

competitive

with

respect

to

originatin

g

loans,

acquiring

deposits

and

providing

other

banking 
services.

Most

of

our

direct

competitio

n

for

our

products

and

services

comes

from

commercial

banks and

credit unions. 
The

principal

competitors

for

BPPR

include

locally

based

commercial

banks

and

a

few

large

U.S.

and

foreign

banks

with 
operations in Puerto Rico.

We

also

compete

with

specialized

players

in th

e

local

financial

industry

that

are

not subjec

t

to

the

same

regulatory 
restrictions

as domestic

banks

and bank holdin

g

companies.

Those

competitors

include

brokerage

firms,

mortgage

companies, 
insurance

companies,

automobile

and

equipment

finance

companies,

local

and

federal

credit

unions

(locally

known

as 
“cooperativas”),

credit car

d

companies,

consumer

finance

companies,

institutional

lenders,

and other

financial

and non-financia

l 
institutions

and entities.

Credit

unions

generally

provide

basic consume

r

financial

services and collectively

represent a

significant 
portion of the

market with

a lower cost structure

and fewer regulatory

constraints. 
In

the

United

States

we

continue

to

face

substantial

competitive

pressure

as

our

footprint

resides

in

the

two

large 
metropolitan markets of New York City / Northern New Jersey and the greater Miami area.

There is a large number of banks in both 
markets, including community, regional, and national ones, most of which have

more resources than us. 
In both

Puerto Rico

and the

United States,

the primary

factors in

competing

for business

include

pricing,

convenience 
of branch

locations

and other

delivery

methods,

range of

products offered,

and the

level of

service delivered.

We must

compete 
effectively

along

all

these

parameters

to

be

successful.

We

experience

pricing

pressure

as

some

of

our

competitors

seek

to 
increase

market

share

by

reducing

prices

for

services

or

the

rates

charged

on

loans,

increasing

the

interest

rates

offered

on 
deposits

or offering

more flexible

terms. Increased

competition

could require

that we

increase

the rates

offered

on deposits

and 
lower the rates

charged on loans,

which could adversely

affect our profitability. 
Economic

factors,

along

with

legislative

and

technological

changes,

have

an

ongoing

impact

on

the

competitive 
environment

within

the financia

l

services

industry.

We work

to anticipat

e

and adap

t

to dynamic

competitive

conditions

whether 
through developing

and marketing

innovative

products

and services,

adopting

or developin

g

new technologie

s

that

differentiat

e 
our products

and

services,

cross-marketing,

or

providing

personalized

banking

services.

We

strive

to

distinguish

ourselves 
from

other

banks

and

financial

services

providers

in our

marketplace

by providin

g

a high

level

of service

to enhance

customer 
loyalty

and to attrac

t

and retain

business.

However,

we can

provide

no assurance

as

to

the

effectiveness

of

these

efforts

on 
our

future

business

or

results

of

operations,

and

as

to

our

continued

ability

to

anticipate

and

adapt

to

changing 
conditions,

and

to

sufficientl

y

improve

our

services

and/or

banking

products,

in

order

to

successfully

compete

in

our

primary 
service

areas. 
Transformation Initiatives: 

11 
The

Corporation

launched

a significant,

multi-year,

broad-based

technological

and

business

process

transformation

during

the 
second

half

of

2022

which

continued

during

2024.

The

needs

and

expectations

of

our

clients,

as

well

as

the

competitive 
landscape,

have evolved,

compelling

us to

make important

investments

in our

technological

infrastructure

and adopt

more agile 
practices.

During

2024,

the

Corporation

made

meaningful

progress

in

the

modernization

of

our

customer

channels

and 
enhancement

of

our

customers'

experience.

The

Corporation

believes

these

investments

will

result

in

an

enhanced

digital 
experience

for

our

clients,

as

well

as

better

technology

and

more

efficient

processes

for

our

employees,

and

make

us

a more 
efficient

and

profitable

company.

The

Corporation

had

anticipated

to

reach

a target

of

14%

return

on

tangible

common

equity 
(ROTCE)

by

the

fourth

quarter

of

2025.

However,

due

to

a

variety

of

drivers,

including

the

impact

of

the

shift

to

higher-cost 
deposits

in

2024,

and

lower

than

expected

loan

growth

in

the

U.S.,

the

Corporation

now

expects

to

achieve

at

least

a

12% 
ROTCE by the

end of 2025.

Our technology

and business

transformation

will be a

significant

priority for

the Corporation

over the 
next years.

Refer to

the Overview

of Management’s

Discussion

and Analysis

in this

Form 10-K

for information 
on recent significant

events that have

impacted or

will impact our

current and future

operations. 
Human Capital Management 
Popular

seeks

to

embody

our

purpose

of “putting

people

at the

center

of progress”

throughout

its human

capital

management. 
Attracting,

developing

and

retaining

top

talent

in

an

environment

that

promotes

wellness,

inclusion,

respect,

learning

and 
transparency

are fundamental

pillars

of our

long-term

strategy.

As of

December

31, 2024,

Popular

had 9,406

employees,

none 
of whom were

represented

by a collective

bargaining group. 
Nurturing Well

-Being: Employee

Health & Financial

Security 
Popular

believes

that

the

health

and

financial

wellness

of

our

employees

is

essential

to

effectively

serve

our

customers

and 
contribute

positively

to the

communities

where we

operate.

Our health

and wellness

program includes

health, pharmacy,

vision 
and dental

insurance,

as well

as other

wellness

initiatives.

Our programs

seek to

ensure that

healthcare

is both

accessible

and 
affordable

for our

employees,

with Popular

covering

up to

80% of

health

insurance

premiums,

a figure

that

surpasses

regional 
benchmarks.

In

2024,

we

prioritized

mental

health

by

emphasizing

the

importance

of

addressing

our

employees’

emotional 
needs

and

launching

an

internal

campaign

featuring

short

videos

on

wellness.

We

also

shared

valuable

information

on

the 
importance

of

sleep

hygiene.

Additionally,

the

Corporation

promotes

Moreover,

Popular

offers

a profit

-sharing 
plan,

contingent

upon

the

achievement

of

pre-set

financial

goals,

to

further

align

employee

compensation

with

its

success.

The

profit-sharing

plan

allows

employees

to

receive

up to

8%

of

their

eligible

compensation

(capped

at

$70,000),

of 
which

the

first

4%

is

paid

Our

focus

on

training

and

development

has

provided

internal

growth

opportunities

to

our

workforce.

As

a

result,

the 
Corporation’s

internal mobility

rate in 2024

was 44%. This

included employees

who applied

During

2024,

we

engaged

303 
participants

in such

programs,

further

advancing

the organization’s

talent.

In 2024,

Popular

also strategically

aligned

employee 
performance

appraisals

with

the

company's

cultural

framework,

by

transitioning

to

evaluate

our

new

values

and

behaviors 
instead

of

organizational

competencies.

This

shift

supports

the

development

of

a

culture

that

prioritizes

the

company’s

core 
values and desired

behaviors.

Our

organizational

was

crucial

in

enhancing

organizational

development

through

targeted

initiatives.

By 
implementing

activities

like

sessions, we

aim to cultivate

a cohesive and

adaptable workforce. 
Enhancing Leadership

Regulation and Supervision 
Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Popular, Popular North America 
(“PNA”)

and

their

respective

subsidiaries.

Such

laws

and

regulations

are

continually

under

review

by

Congress

and

state 
legislatures

and

federal

and

state

regulatory

agencies.

Any

change

in

the

laws

and

regulations

applicable

to

Popular

and

its 
subsidiaries could have a material effect on the

business of Popular and its subsidiaries. We will continue to

assess our businesses 
and risk management and compliance practices

to conform to developments in the regulatory

environment. 
General
Popular and PNA are bank holding companies subject to consolidated supervision and

regulation by the Federal Reserve 
Board under

the Bank

Holding Company Act

of 1956

(as amended, the

“BHC Act”). BPPR

and PB

are subject to

supervision and 
examination by applicable

federal and state

banking agencies including,

in the

case of BPPR,

the Federal Reserve

Board and the 
Office of

the Commissioner

of Financial

Institutions of

Puerto Rico

(the “Office

of the

Commissioner”), and, in

the case

of PB,

the 
Federal

Reserve

Board

and

the

New

York

State

Department

of

Financial

Services

(the

“NYSDFS”).

Popular’s

broker-dealer

Popular Securities,

LLC (“PS”)

and investment

advisor subsidiary

Popular Asset

Management LLC 

13 
(“PAM”)

are subject

to

regulation by

the SEC,

the Financial

Industry

Regulatory Authority

(“FINRA”), and

the Securities

Investor 
Protection Corporation, among others. Other of our non-bank subsidiaries conduct reinsurance and

insurance producer and agency 
activities, which are

subject to other

federal, state and

Puerto Rico laws

and regulations as

well as licensing

and regulation by

the 
Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and,

for one insurance agency subsidiary, the NYSDFS. 
Enhanced Prudential Standards 
Under

the

Consumer

Protection

Act

(the

“Dodd-Frank

Act”),

as

modified

by

the 
Economic

Growth,

Regulatory

Relief,

and

Consumer

Protection

Act

and

the

federal

banking

regulators’

2019

“Tailoring

Rules,” 
banking

organizations are

categorized based

on status

as

a U.S.

G-SIB,

size

and four

other risk-based

indicators. Among

bank 
holding companies with $100

billion or more in

total consolidated assets, the

most stringent standards apply

to U.S. G-SIBs,

which 
are subject to Category I standards and the

least stringent standards apply to Category IV organizations, which have between $100 
billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in all four other risk-based indicators and

which are also 
not U.S. G-SIBs. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to risk committee and risk 
management requirements. As of December 31, 2024,

Popular had total consolidated assets of $73.0 billion. 
Transactions with Affiliates 
BPPR

and

PB

are

subject

to

restrictions

that

limit

the

amount

of

extensions

of

credit

and

certain

other

“covered 
transactions” (as defined in Section

23A of the Federal

Reserve Act) between BPPR or

PB, on the

one hand, and Popular,

PNA or 
any

of

our

other

non-banking

subsidiaries,

on

the

other

hand,

and

that

impose

collateralization

requirements

on

such

credit 
extensions. A bank may not engage in any covered transaction if the aggregate amount of the bank’s covered transactions with that 
affiliate would exceed 10% of

the bank’s capital stock and

surplus or the aggregate amount of

the bank’s covered transactions with 
all non-bank affiliates would exceed 20%

of the bank’s capital stock and

surplus. In addition, any transaction between BPPR

or PB, 
on the one

hand, and Popular,

PNA or any

of our other

non-banking subsidiaries, on

the other,

is required to

be carried out

on an 
arm’s length basis. 
Source of Financial Strength
The

Dodd-Frank Act

requires bank

holding companies,

such

as Popular

and

PNA, to

act

as

a source

of

financial

and 
managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Popular

and PNA are expected to commit resources

to support their subsidiary banks, 
including at times when Popular

and PNA may not be

in a financial position to

provide such resources. Any capital loans

by a bank 
holding company

to any

of its

subsidiary depository

institutions are

subordinated in

right of

payment to

depositors and

to certain 
other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the

event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy,

any commitment 
by

the

bank

holding

company

to

a

federal

banking

agency

to

maintain

the

capital

of

a

subsidiary

depository

institution

will

be 
assumed by

the bankruptcy

trustee and

entitled to

a priority

of payment.

BPPR and

PB are

currently the

only insured

depository 
institution subsidiaries of Popular and PNA. 
Resolution Planning and Resolution-Related Requirements 
A 
bank holding

company with

$250 billion

or more

in total

consolidated assets

(or that

is a

Category III

firm based

on 
certain risk-based indicators described in the Tailoring

Rules) is required to report periodically to the FDIC

and the Federal Reserve 
Board

such

company’s

plan

for

its

rapid

and

orderly

resolution

in

the

event

of

material

financial

distress

or

failure.

In

addition, 
insured depository institutions with total

assets of $50 billion or

more are required to

submit to the FDIC

periodic contingency plans 
for

resolution

in

the

event

of

the

institution’s

failure.

In

June

2024,

the

FDIC

finalized

amendments

to

the

resolution

planning 
requirements for insured depository institutions with

$50 billion or more in

total assets. The amendments require insured

depository 
institutions with

between $50

billion and $100

billion in

assets to submit

informational filings on

a three-year cycle,

with an

interim 
supplement updating key information submitted in the off years. These

amendments became effective October 1, 2024, and BPPR’s 
first submission under the new rule is due by

April 1, 2026. 
On August

29, 2023,

the Federal

Reserve Board,

FDIC and

Office of

the Comptroller

of the

Currency (“OCC”)

issued a 
proposed

rule

that

would

require

bank

holding

companies

and

insured

depository

institutions

with

$100

billion

or

more

in 
consolidated assets (as well as their insured depository institution affiliates) to maintain minimum

amounts of eligible long-term debt 
(generally, debt

that is unsecured, has

a maturity greater than one

year from issuance and satisfies

additional criteria), subject to a 
three-year phase-in

period. The

proposal would

also apply

“clean holding

company” requirements

to Category

II through

IV bank 
holding companies, which

would, among other

things, prohibit

prohibit those holding

companies from entering

into derivatives

and 
certain other financial contracts with third parties. 

14 
As of December 31, 2024, Popular,

PNA, BPPR and PB’s total assets were

below the thresholds for applicability of these 
rules, except that

BPPR is subject

to the FDIC’s

resolution planning requirements

applicable to insured

depository institutions with 
more than $50 billion but less than $100 billion

in assets. 
FDIC Insurance
Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of 
the

FDIC,

and

BPPR

and

PB

are

subject

to

FDIC

deposit

insurance

assessments

to

maintain

the

DIF.

Deposit

insurance 
assessments are

based on

the average

consolidated total

assets of

the insured

depository institution

minus the

average tangible 
equity of the institution during the assessment period. For larger

depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets,

such as BPPR 
and PB, the FDIC uses a “scorecard” methodology, which considers CAMELS ratings, among

other measures, that seeks to capture 
both the probability that an individual large institution will

fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF

if such a failure occurs. The 
FDIC has the ability

to make discretionary adjustments to the

total score based upon significant

risk factors that are not

adequately 
captured in the calculations. The initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for larger depository institutions ranges from 3 to 30 
basis points on an annualized basis.

After the effect of

potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could

range 
from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized

basis. 
In

October

2022,

the

FDIC

finalized

a

rule

that

increased

initial

base

deposit

insurance

assessment

rates

by

2

basis 
points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
(“FDIA”), established

a plan

in September

2020 to

restore the

DIF reserve

ratio to

meet or

exceed the

statutory minimum

of 1.35 
percent within

eight years. The

increased assessment is

intended to improve

the likelihood that

the DIF

reserve ratio would

reach 
the required minimum by the statutory deadline

of September 30, 2028. 
As of December 31, 2024, BPPR and

PB had a DIF average total asset

less average tangible equity assessment base of 
approximately $67 billion. 
On

November 16,

2023,

the

FDIC finalized

a

rule

that

imposes

a special

assessment to

recover the

costs to

the

DIF 
resulting

from

the

FDIC’s

use,

in

March

2023,

of

the systemic

risk

exception to

the

least-cost resolution

test

under the

FDIA

in 
connection with the

receiverships of Silicon

Valley Bank

and Signature Bank.

The FDIC estimated

in approving the

rule that those 
assessed losses

total approximately $16.3

billion. The

rule provides

that this

loss estimate

will be

periodically adjusted, which

will 
affect

the

amount

of

the

special assessment.

Under the

rule, the

assessment

base

is

the

estimated uninsured

deposits that

an 
insured depository

institution reported

in its

Consolidated Reports of

Condition and Income

(“Call Report”)

at December

31, 2022, 
excluding the

first

$5 billion

in estimated

uninsured deposits.

For a

holding company

that

has more

than one

insured depository 
institution

subsidiary,

such

as

Popular,

the

$5

billion

exclusion

is

allocated

among

the

company’s

insured

depository

institution 
subsidiaries

in

proportion

to

each

insured

depository

institution’s

estimated

uninsured

deposits.

The

special

assessments

are 
collected at an

annual rate of

approximately 13.4 basis points

per year (3.36

basis points per

quarter) over eight quarters,

with the 
first assessment period having begun

January 1, 2024. Because the

estimated loss pursuant to the

systemic risk determination will 
be periodically adjusted,

the FDIC retains

the ability to

cease collection early,

extend the special

assessment collection period

and 
impose a

final shortfall

special assessment

on a

one-time basis.

In June

2024, due

to the

increase in

the estimate

of losses,

the 
FDIC announced that it

projects that the special assessment will

be collected for an additional

two quarters beyond the initial

eight-
quarter collection period, at a lower rate. 
Brokered Deposits
The FDIA

and regulations

adopted thereunder

restrict the

use of

brokered deposits

and the

rate of

interest payable

on 
deposits for institutions

that are less

than well capitalized.

Popular does not

believe the brokered

deposits regulations have

had or 
will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity

of BPPR and PB. 
Capital Adequacy
Popular, PNA,

BPPR and PB are

each required to comply

with applicable capital adequacy standards

established by the 
federal

banking

agencies

(the

“Capital

Rules”),

which

implement

the

Basel

III

framework

set

forth

by

the

Basel

Committee

on 
Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) as

well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Among other

matters, the

Capital Rules:

(i) impose

a capital

measure called

“Common Equity

Tier

1” (“CET1”)

and the 
related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 
capital” instruments meeting

certain revised requirements;

and (iii) mandate

that most deductions/adjustments to

regulatory capital 

15 
measures be made

to CET1

and not to

the other components

of capital.

Under the Capital

Rules, for most

banking organizations, 
including

Popular,

the

most

common

form

of

Additional

Tier

1

capital

is

non-cumulative

perpetual preferred

stock

and

the

most 
common form of Tier

2 capital is subordinated notes and

a portion of the

allocation for loan and lease losses,

in each case, subject 
to the Capital Rules’ specific requirements. 
Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum

capital ratios are: 
4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 
6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted

assets; 
8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 
4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported

on consolidated financial statements (known

as the 
“leverage ratio”). 
The Capital Rules also impose

a “capital conservation buffer,”

composed entirely of CET1, on top

of these minimum risk-
weighted

asset

ratios. The

capital

conservation

buffer

is

designed

to

absorb

losses

during

periods

of

economic stress.

Banking 
institutions

with

a

ratio

of

CET1

to

risk-weighted

assets

above

the

minimum

but

below

the

capital

conservation

buffer

will

face 
constraints on

dividends, equity repurchases

and compensation based

on the

amount of

the shortfall and

eligible retained

income 
(that is, four

quarter trailing net income, net

of distributions and tax effects

not reflected in net

income). Popular, BPPR

and PB are 
therefore required to maintain such additional capital

conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1,

effectively resulting in minimum ratios of 
(i) CET1

to risk-weighted

assets of

at least

7%, (ii)

Tier

1 capital

to risk-weighted

assets of

at least

8.5%, and

(iii) Total

capital to 
risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 
Pursuant

to

the

Capital

Rules,

the

effects

of

certain

accumulated other

comprehensive income

or

loss

(“AOCI”)

items 
included in stockholders’ equity

(for example, marks-to-market of securities

held in the available

for sale portfolio) are

not excluded 
from

regulatory

capital

ratios;

however,

banking

organizations

that

are

not

subject

to

Categories

I

or

II

standards

under

the 
framework for

banking organizations

with $100

billion or

more in

assets, including

Popular,

BPPR and

PB, may

make a

one-time 
permanent election to continue to

exclude these items. Popular,

BPPR and PB have

made this election in order

to avoid significant 
variations in

the level

of capital

depending upon

the impact

of interest

rate fluctuations

on the

fair value

of their

available for

sale 
securities portfolios.

On July

27, 2023,

the federal

banking regulators

proposed revisions

to the

Capital Rules

to implement

the 
Basel Committee’s 2017 standards, described

below, and make

other changes to the

Capital Rules, including the ability

of banking 
organizations in Categories III and IV to elect not to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital. The proposal introduces 
revised credit risk, equity risk, operational risk, credit valuation adjustment risk and market risk requirements, among other changes. 
However, the

revised capital requirements

of the

proposed rule would

not apply

to Popular,

BPPR, or

PB because

they have

less 
than $100 billion in total consolidated assets and trading

assets and liabilities below the threshold for market risk requirements. The 
Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects

to work with the other federal banking regulators

on a revised proposal in 2025. 
The

Capital

Rules

preclude certain

hybrid

securities, such

as

trust

preferred

securities, from

inclusion

in

bank

holding 
companies’ Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities no

longer included in Popular’s Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a 
component of

Tier 2 capital.

Popular has

not issued

any trust

preferred securities since

May 19,

2010. As

of December

31, 2024, 
Popular has

$193 million

of trust

preferred securities

outstanding which

no longer

qualify for

Tier

1 capital

treatment, but

instead 
qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment.
The Capital Rules also provide for a number of deductions

from and adjustments to CET1.

Banking organizations that are 
not subject to Category

I or II standards

are subject to rules that

provide for simplified capital requirements relating

to the threshold 
deductions

for

certain

mortgage

servicing

assets,

deferred

tax

assets,

investments

in

the

capital

of

unconsolidated

financial 
institutions and inclusion of minority interests

in regulatory capital. 
Failure

to

meet

capital

guidelines

could

subject

Popular

and

its

depository

institution

subsidiaries

to

a

variety

of 
enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC

and to certain restrictions on our business. Refer

In

December 2017,

the Basel

Committee published

standards that

it

described as

the finalization

of the

Basel III

post-
crisis regulatory

reforms. Among other

things, these

standards revise

the Basel

Committee’s standardized approach

for credit

risk 
(including

by

recalibrating

risk

weights

and

introducing

new

capital

requirements

for

certain

“unconditionally

cancellable 
commitments,” such

as

unused credit

card

lines of

credit) and

provide

a new

standardized approach

for operational

risk capital. 

16 
Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to Category I and Category II 
banking organizations and not to Popular, BPPR and PB. 
In

December

2018,

the

federal

banking

agencies

approved

a

final

rule

modifying

their

regulatory

capital

rules

and 
providing an

option to

phase in

over a

period of

three years

the day-one

regulatory capital

effects of

the Current

Expected Credit 
Loss (“CECL”) model

of ASU 2016-13.

The final

rule also revised

the agencies’

other rules to

reflect the update

to the

accounting 
standards. Popular has availed itself

of the option to

phase in over a period

of three years the

day one effects on

regulatory capital 
from the

adoption of

CECL. In

2020, federal

bank regulators

adopted a

rule that

allowed banking

organizations to

elect to

delay 
temporarily

the

estimated

effects

of

adopting

CECL

on

regulatory

capital

until

January

2022

and

subsequently

to

phase

in

the 
effects

through January

2025. Our

2024

regulatory capital

ratios reflect

this election

to

phase in

the effects

of

CECL, but

future 
regulatory capital ratios will include the full impact

from CECL now that the phase-in period has ended. 
Refer to

the Consolidated

Financial Statements

in this

Form 10-K.,

Note 20

and Table

10 of

Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis for the

capital ratios of Popular,

BPPR and PB

under Basel III. Refer

to the Consolidated Financial Statements

in this 
Form 10-K Note 2 for more information regarding

CECL.

Prompt Corrective Action
The

FDIA

requires,

among

other

things,

the

federal

banking

agencies

to

take

prompt

corrective

action

in

respect

of 
insured

depository

institutions

that

do

not

meet

minimum

capital

requirements.

The

FDIA

establishes

five

capital

tiers:

“well 
capitalized,”

“adequately

capitalized,”

“undercapitalized,”

“significantly

undercapitalized,”

and

“critically

undercapitalized”.

A 
depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its

capital levels compare with various relevant capital

measures and certain 
other factors. 
An insured

depository institution will

be deemed

to be

(i) “well

capitalized” if

the institution

has a

total risk-based

capital 
ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%

or greater, a Tier 1

risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage 
ratio of 5.0% or

greater, and is

not subject to any order

or written directive by

any such regulatory authority to

meet and maintain a 
specific capital level for any capital

measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution

has a total risk-based capital ratio

of 8.0% 
or greater, a

CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%

or greater, a

Tier 1 risk-based capital

ratio of 6.0% or greater,

and a leverage ratio of

4.0% 
or greater

and is

not “well

capitalized”; (iii)

“undercapitalized” if

the institution

has a

total risk-based

capital ratio

that is

less than 
8.0%, a CET1 capital

ratio less than 4.5%,

a Tier 1

risk-based capital ratio of

less than 6.0% or

a leverage ratio of

less than 4.0%; 
(iv) “significantly

undercapitalized” if

the institution

has a

total risk-based

capital ratio

of less

than 6.0%,

a CET1

capital ratio

less 
than 3%, a Tier

1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or

a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%;

and (v) “critically undercapitalized” 
if

the

institution’s

tangible

equity

is

equal

to

or

less

than

2.0%

of

average

quarterly

tangible

assets.

An

institution

may

be 
downgraded to, or deemed

to be in, a

capital category that is

lower than indicated by

its capital ratios if

it is determined to

be in an 
unsafe

or

unsound

condition

or

if

it

receives

an

unsatisfactory

examination

rating

with

respect

to

certain

matters.

An

insured 
depository institution’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action

regulations, and the 
capital category

may not

constitute an

accurate representation

of the

institution’s overall

financial condition

or prospects

for other 
purposes. 
The FDIA generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital

distribution (including payment of a 
dividend) or

paying any

management fee to

its holding

company, if

the depository

institution would thereafter

be undercapitalized. 
Undercapitalized

depository

institutions

are

subject

to

restrictions

on

borrowing

from

the

Federal

Reserve

System.

In

addition, 
undercapitalized

depository

institutions

are

subject

to

growth

limitations

and

are

required

to

submit

capital

restoration

plans.

A 
depository institution’s

holding company must

guarantee the capital

restoration plan, up

to an

amount equal to

the lesser

of 5%

of 
the

depository

institution’s

assets

at

the

time

it

becomes

undercapitalized

or

the

amount

of

the

capital

deficiency,

when

the 
institution fails to comply with the

plan. The federal banking agencies may not

accept a capital restoration plan without determining, 
among other things,

that the plan

is based

on realistic assumptions

and is

likely to succeed

in restoring the

depository institution’s 
capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an

acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is

significantly undercapitalized. 
Significantly

undercapitalized

depository

institutions

may

be

subject

to

a

number

of

requirements

and

restrictions, 
including orders to

sell sufficient voting

stock to become

adequately capitalized, requirements to

reduce total assets

and cessation 
of receipt

of deposits

from correspondent

banks. Critically

undercapitalized depository

institutions are

subject to

appointment of

a 
receiver or conservator. 

17 
The capital-based prompt

corrective action provisions

of the FDIA

apply to

the FDIC-insured depository

institutions such 
as

BPPR

and

PB,

but

they

are

not

directly

applicable

to

holding

companies

such

as

Popular

and

PNA,

which

control

such 
institutions. As of December 31, 2024,

both BPPR and PB met the quantitative requirements

for ‘well capitalized’ status. 
Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases 
The

principal

sources

of

funding

for

Popular

and

PNA

have

included

dividends

received

from

their

banking

and

non-
banking subsidiaries, asset sales

and proceeds from

the issuance of

debt and equity.

Various statutory

provisions limit the amount 
of

dividends an

insured depository

institution may

pay to

its

holding company

without regulatory

approval. A

member bank

must 
obtain the approval of the

Federal Reserve Board for any

dividend, if the total of

all dividends declared by the

member bank during 
the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year,

combined with its retained net income for the preceding two 
years, after

considering those

years’ dividend

activity,

less any

required transfers to

surplus or

to a

fund for

the retirement

of any 
preferred stock. During the year

ended December 31, 2024, BPPR declared

cash dividends of $600

million, a portion of

which was 
used by Popular for the payments of the cash dividends on its

outstanding common stock. At December 31, 2024, BPPR needed to 
obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before declaring a dividend

in excess of $318 million due to its

retained income, 
declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the

three year’s ended December 31, 2024. In addition, a member 
bank may

not declare

or pay

a dividend

in an

amount greater

than its

undivided profits

as reported

in its

Report of

Condition and 
Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of

the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit

any 
portion of its permanent capital to

be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has

been approved by the Federal Reserve Board.

Pursuant 
to

these

requirements, PB

may

not

declare

or

pay

a

dividend without

the

prior

approval

of

the

Federal

Reserve

Board

and

the 
NYSDFS.
During the year

ended December 31,

2024, PB

declared cash dividends

of $50

million, a portion

of which

was used

by 
Popular for the payments of the cash dividends on

its outstanding common stock. 
It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common

stock only out 
of net

income available to

common shareholders

over the past

year and

only if

the prospective rate

of earnings retention

appears 
consistent with the organization’s current and

expected future capital needs, asset quality

and overall financial condition. Moreover, 
under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank

holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the 
capital of depository

institution subsidiaries or that

may undermine the bank

holding company’s ability to

be a source

of strength to 
its

banking subsidiaries.

Federal Reserve

policy

also

provides that

a

bank

holding company

should

inform

the

Federal

Reserve 
reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that

exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is

being paid or 
that could result in a material adverse change

to the bank holding company’s capital structure.

The

Federal Reserve

Board

also restricts

the

ability of

banking

organizations to

conduct stock

repurchases. In

certain 
circumstances, a banking organization’s repurchases

of its common stock may

be subject to a

prior approval or notice requirement 
under other regulations or policies of the Federal Reserve. Any redemption or

repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt is 
subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 
Subject to compliance with certain conditions, distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation organized under

the 
laws

of the

Commonwealth of

Puerto Rico

are subject

to

a withholding

tax

of 10%

instead of

the 30%

applied to

other “foreign” 
corporations. Accordingly, dividends from current or accumulated earnings and profits

paid by PNA to Popular, Inc. sourced from the 
U.S. operations of PB are subject to a 10% tax withholding.
A corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is generally subject to a branch profits tax of 30% on its earnings and profits

for the 
taxable year that are “effectively connected” with

such U.S. trade or business, adjusted as

provided by U.S. federal income tax law. 
Accordingly,

to

the extent

BPPR’s

U.S. operations

generate effectively

connected earnings

and profits

that

are not

reinvested in 
such U.S. operations

(and that are

not otherwise adjusted

as provided by

U.S. federal income tax

law), such effectively

connected 
earnings and profits will generally be subject

to a branch profits tax of 30%.

Refer to

Part II,

Item 5,

“Market for

Registrant’s Common

Equity,

Related Stockholder

Matters and

Issuer Purchases

of 
Equity Securities” for further information on Popular’s

distribution of dividends and repurchases of equity

securities. 
See

“Puerto

Rico

Regulation”

below

for

a

description

of

certain

restrictions

on

BPPR’s

ability

to

pay

dividends

under 
Puerto Rico law. 
Interstate Branching
The Dodd-Frank

Act amended

the Riegle-Neal

Interstate Banking

and Branching

Efficiency Act

of 1994

(the “Interstate 
Banking

Act”)

to

authorize

national

banks

and

state

banks

to

branch

interstate

through 
de

novo

branches. For

purposes

of

the 

18 
Interstate Banking Act, BPPR is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state 
banks. 
Activities and Acquisitions
In general, the BHC Act limits the activities

permissible for bank holding companies to the business of banking, managing 
or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to 
be

properly

incidental

thereto.

A

company

that

meets

management

and

capital

standards

and

whose

subsidiary

depository 
institutions meet management,

capital and

Community Reinvestment Act

(“CRA”) standards may

elect to

be treated

as a

financial 
holding company

and engage

in a

substantially broader

range of

nonbanking financial

activities, including

securities underwriting 
and dealing, insurance underwriting and making

merchant banking investments in nonfinancial

companies. 
In order for a bank holding company to elect to be treated as a financial

holding company, (i) all of its depository institution 
subsidiaries

must

be

well capitalized

(as described

above)

and

well managed

and

(ii)

it

must

file a

declaration with

the Federal 
Reserve Board that it elects to be a “financial holding

company.” As noted above, a bank

holding company electing to be a financial 
holding company must itself be and remain

well capitalized and well managed. The Federal Reserve Board’s

regulations applicable 
to bank holding companies separately define

“well capitalized” for bank holding companies,

such as Popular,

to require maintaining 
a tier 1 capital

ratio of at least

6% and a total capital

ratio of at least 10%.

Popular and PNA have elected

to be treated as

financial 
holding

companies.

A

depository

institution

is

deemed

to

be

“well

managed”

if,

at

its

most

recent

inspection,

examination

or 
subsequent review

by the

appropriate federal banking

agency (or

the appropriate state

banking agency), the

depository institution 
received

at

least

a

“satisfactory”

composite

rating

and

at

least

a

“satisfactory”

rating

for

the

management

component

of

the 
composite

rating.

If,

after

becoming

a

financial

holding

company,

the

company

fails

to

continue

to

meet

any

of

the

capital

or 
management requirements

for financial

holding company

status, the

company

must

enter into

a confidential

agreement with

the 
Federal

Reserve

Board

to

comply

with

all

applicable capital

and

management

requirements.

If

the

company

does

not

return

to 
compliance

within

180

days,

the

Federal

Reserve

Board

may

extend

the

agreement

or

may

order

the

company

to

divest

its 
subsidiary banks or the

company may discontinue, or

divest investments in companies

engaged in, activities permissible only

for a 
bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial

holding company. In addition, if a depository institution subsidiary 
controlled by a financial holding company does not

maintain a CRA rating of at least “satisfactory,” the financial holding company

will 
be subject to restrictions on certain new activities

and acquisitions. 
The Federal Reserve Board

may in certain circumstances limit

our ability to conduct

activities and make acquisitions that 
would otherwise be permissible for

a financial holding company.

Furthermore, a financial holding company must obtain

prior written 
approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring a nonbank company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. 
In addition, we

are required to

obtain prior Federal

Reserve Board approval

before engaging in

certain banking and

other financial 
activities both in the United States and abroad. 
The “Volcker

Rule” adopted

as part

of the

Dodd-Frank Act

restricts the

ability of

Popular and

its subsidiaries,

including 
BPPR and PB as

well as non-banking subsidiaries, to

sponsor or invest in

“covered funds,” including private funds,

or to engage in 
certain types

of proprietary

trading. Popular

and its

subsidiaries generally

do not

engage in

the businesses

subject to

the Volcker 
Rule; therefore, the Volcker Rule does not have a material effect on our

operations.

Anti-Money Laundering Initiative and the USA PATRIOT Act
A major focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in

recent years has been aimed at combating money 
laundering and

terrorist financing.

The USA

PATRIOT

Act of

2001 (the

“USA PATRIOT

Act”) strengthened

the ability

of the

U.S. 
government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money

laundering and the financing of terrorism. Title

III of the USA 
PATRIOT

Act imposed

significant compliance

and due

diligence obligations,

created new

crimes and

penalties and

expanded the 
extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act’s requirements 
could have serious legal and reputational consequences

for the institution. 
The

Anti-Money

Laundering

Act

of

2020

(“AMLA”),

which

amended

the

Bank

Secrecy

Act

(the

“BSA”),

is

intended

to 
comprehensively

reform

and

modernize

U.S.

anti-money

laundering

laws.

Among

other

things,

the

AMLA

codifies

a

risk-based 
approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to

promulgate 
priorities

for

anti-money

laundering

and

countering

the

financing

of

terrorism

policy;

requires

the

development

of

standards

for 
testing technology and

internal processes for BSA

compliance; expands enforcement-

and investigation-related authority,

including 
a

significant

expansion

in

the

available

sanctions

for

certain

BSA

violations;

and

expands

BSA

whistleblower

incentives

and 

19 
protections.

Many

of

the

statutory

provisions

in

the

AMLA

require

additional

rulemakings,

reports

and

other

measures,

and

the 
impact

of

the

AMLA

will

depend on,

among

other

things,

rulemaking and

implementation guidance.

In

June

2021,

the

Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of

the U.S. Department of the

Treasury,

issued the priorities for anti-money laundering

and 
countering the

financing of

terrorism policy

required under AMLA.

The priorities

include: corruption, cybercrime,

terrorist financing, 
fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and

proliferation financing. 
Federal regulators

regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money

Laundering and sanctions

compliance to

enhance their

adequacy 
and effectiveness, and the frequency and extent of such examinations

and related remedial actions have been

increasing. 
Community Reinvestment Act
The

CRA

requires

banks

to

help

serve

the

credit

needs

of

their

communities,

including

extending

credit

to

low-

and 
moderate-income individuals

and geographies.

Should

Popular

or our

bank

subsidiaries

fail

to

serve

adequately

the community, 
potential penalties may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate offices or branches, add subsidiaries 
and affiliates, expand

into new financial activities

and merge with or

purchase other financial institutions.

On October 24, 2023,

the 
OCC,

the

Federal

Reserve

Board,

and

the

FDIC

jointly

issued

a

final

rule

to

modernize

the

federal

banking

agencies’

CRA 
regulations and respond to changes in the

banking industry. Among other

items, the final rule introduces new tests

under which the 
performance of banks will

be assessed and includes

data collection and reporting requirements,

many of which are

applicable only 
to banks with over $10 billion in assets, such as

BPPR and PB. The effective date of the final rule was

April 1, 2024; however, banks 
are not

required to begin

complying with certain

provisions of the

final rule

until January 1,

2026, with data

reporting requirements 
becoming

applicable

on

January

1,

2027.

The

final

rule

has

been

challenged

in

federal

court

and

is

currently

stayed

as

to

the 
plaintiff trade associations while the court considers the

validity of the rule. 
Interchange Fees Regulation
The Federal Reserve Board

has established standards for

debit card interchange fees

and prohibited network exclusivity 
arrangements and routing restrictions. The

maximum permissible interchange fee that

an issuer may receive

for an electronic debit 
transaction is

the sum

of

21 cents

per transaction

and 5

basis points

multiplied by

the value

of

the transaction.

Additionally,

the 
Federal Reserve

Board allows

for an

upward adjustment

of

no more

than 1

cent

to

an issuer’s

debit card

interchange fee

if the 
issuer develops and implements policies and procedures

reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention

standards. 
In

October

2023,

the

Federal

Reserve

Board

proposed

amendments

to

its

rules

on

interchange

fees.

The

proposed 
changes would establish a

maximum permissible interchange fee of

no more than

14.4 cents per transaction

plus four basis points 
multiplied by

the value

of the

transaction. The

fraud prevention

adjustment would

be increased

to 1.3

cents per

transaction. The 
proposed rule would also establish an automatic update of the interchange fee cap every other year based on a survey of debit card 
issuers. 
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
The Consumer

Financial Protection

Bureau (the

“CFPB”) supervises

“covered persons”

(broadly defined

to include

any 
person offering or

providing a consumer financial

product or service and

any affiliated service

provider) for compliance with

federal 
consumer financial laws. The CFPB

also has the broad power

to prescribe rules applicable to

a covered person or service

provider 
identifying

as

unlawful,

unfair,

deceptive,

or

abusive

acts

or

practices

in

connection

with

any

transaction

with

a

consumer

for

a 
consumer financial product or service, or the offering of

a consumer financial product or service. We are subject to examination and 
regulation by the CFPB. 
On October 22, 2024, the CFPB finalized a new rule to implement Section 1033 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act 
that

requires

a

provider

of

payment

accounts

or

products,

such

as

a

bank,

to

make

data

available

to

consumers

upon

request 
regarding the

products or

services they

obtain from

the provider.

Any such

data provider

also has

to make

such data

available to 
third parties, with the consumer’s express authorization and

through an interface that satisfies formatting, performance

and security 
standards,

for

the

purpose

of

such

third

parties

providing

the

consumer

with

financial

products

or

services

requested

by

the 
consumer. Data required to be made available under the rule includes

transaction information, account balance, account and routing 
numbers,

terms

and

conditions,

upcoming

bill

information,

and

certain

account

verification

data.

The

rule

is

intended

to

give 
consumers

control

over

their

financial

data,

including

with

whom

it

is

shared,

and

encourage

competition

in

the

provision

of 
consumer financial

products or

services. For

banks with

at least

$10 billion

and less

than $250

billion in

total assets,

compliance 
with the rule’s requirements is required beginning on

April 1, 2027. 

20 
On December 12, 2024, the

CFPB finalized a rule that

significantly reforms the regulatory framework governing

overdraft 
practices applicable

to banks

such as

BPPR and

PB that

have more

than $10

billion in

assets. The

rule has

an effective

date of 
October

1,

2025.

The

rule

modifies

or

eliminates

several

long-standing

exclusions

from

requirements

generally

applicable

to 
consumer credit

that previously

exempted certain

overdraft practices.

The rule

also generally

requires banks

to restructure

many 
overdraft fees, overdraft lines of credit, and other overdraft practices as separate

consumer credit accounts that would be subject to 
those requirements.

These changes

to the

regulatory framework

could result

in BPPR

and PB,

among other

things, facing

higher 
compliance costs in charging overdraft

fees, experiencing a decreased ability

to recover amounts extended as

overdraft protection, 
reducing the availability of overdraft protection,

and/or charging lower overdraft fees. 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The

U.S.

Treasury

Department

Office

of

Foreign

Assets

Control

(“OFAC”)

administers

economic

sanctions

that

affect 
transactions

with

designated

foreign

countries,

nationals

and

others.

The

OFAC-administered

sanctions

targeting

countries

take 
many

different

forms.

Generally,

however,

they

contain

one

or

more

of

the

following

elements:

(i)

restrictions

on

trade

with

or 
investment in a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking

of assets in which the government of the

sanctioned country or other specially 
designated nationals have an interest, by prohibiting

transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including

property in the United 
States or the possession or control of U.S.

persons outside of the United States). Blocked assets (e.g., property

and bank deposits) 
cannot

be

paid

out,

withdrawn, set

off

or

transferred

in

any

manner without

a

from

OFAC.

Failure

to

comply

with these 
sanctions

could

have

serious

legal

and

reputational

consequences,

including

denial

by

federal

regulators

of

proposed

merger, 
acquisition, restructuring, or other expansionary activity. 
Protection of Customer Personal Information and

Cybersecurity 
The privacy

provisions of

the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

of 1999

generally prohibit financial

institutions, including

us, from 
disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third

parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) 
unless

customers

have

the

opportunity

to

opt

out

of

the

disclosure.

The

Fair

Credit

Reporting

Act

restricts

information

sharing 
among affiliates for marketing purposes and governs

the use and provision of information to consumer

reporting agencies. 
The federal banking regulators have also issued guidance and rules regarding cybersecurity that are intended to enhance 
cyber risk management standards among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish lines

of defense and to 
maintain risk management processes that are designed to address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials. A financial 
institution’s

management

is

expected

to

maintain

sufficient

business

continuity

planning

processes

for

the

rapid

recovery, 
resumption and maintenance of

the institution’s operations

after a cyber-attack involving

destructive malware. A financial

institution 
is

also

expected

to

develop

appropriate

processes

to

enable

recovery

of

data

and

business

operations

and

address

rebuilding 
network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service

providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we

fail 
to observe the

regulatory guidance, we could

be subject to various

regulatory sanctions, including financial

penalties. In November 
2021, the U.S.

federal bank regulatory agencies

issued a final

rule requiring banking organizations,

including Popular,

PNA, BPPR 
and PB, to notify

their primary federal banking regulator

within 36 hours of determining

that a “notification incident” has

occurred. A 
notification incident

is a

“computer-security incident” that

has materially

disrupted or degraded,

or is

reasonably likely to

materially 
disrupt or

degrade, the

banking organization’s

ability to

deliver services

to a

material portion

of its

customer base,

jeopardize the 
viability

of

key

operations

of

the

banking

organization,

or

impact

the

stability

of

the

financial

sector.

The

final

rule

also

requires 
specific and immediate notifications by bank

service providers that become aware of similar

incidents. 
State and foreign regulators

have also been increasingly active

in implementing privacy and cybersecurity

standards and 
regulations. Several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and 
providing detailed requirements with respect to these

programs, including data encryption requirements. In New York,

the NYSDFS 
requires

financial

institutions

regulated

by

the

NYSDFS,

including

PB,

to,

among

other

things,

(i)

establish

and

maintain

a 
cybersecurity program designed

to enhance the

confidentiality, integrity

and availability of

their information systems;

(ii) implement 
and maintain a written

cyber security policy setting forth

policies and procedures for the

protection of their information systems

and 
nonpublic

information;

and

(iii)

designate

a

Chief

Information

Security

Officer.
On

November

1,

2023,

the

NYSDFS

adopted 
amendments to

its

cybersecurity regulations

that

represent

a

significant

update

to

the

regulation of

cybersecurity practices.

The 
amendments

generally

fall

within

the

following

five

categories:

(i)

increased

mandatory

controls

associated

with

common

attack 
vectors,

(ii)

enhanced

requirements

for

privileged

accounts,

(iii)

enhanced

notification

obligations,

(iv)

expansion

of

cyber 
governance practices and (v) additional cybersecurity

requirements for larger companies.

On

July

6,

2023,

the

SEC

adopted

new

rules

that

would

require

registrants,

such

as

Popular,

to

(i)

report

material 

21 
cybersecurity incidents

on Form

8-K and,

(ii) disclose

in Annual

Report on

Form 10-K

cybersecurity policies

and procedures

and 
governance practices, including at the board and

management levels. 
Many states and foreign

governments have also recently implemented or

modified their data breach notification

and data 
privacy

requirements. The

California Consumer

Privacy Act

(“CCPA”)

imposes privacy

compliance obligations

with regard

to

the 
collection,

use

and

disclosure of

personal

information of

California residents,

and the

November 2020

amendment to

the

CCPA 
creates the California Privacy Protection Agency, a watchdog privacy agency, and further expands the scope of businesses covered 
by the law

and certain rights relating

to personal information. The

substantive obligations under the

2020 amendment to the

CCPA 
became effective

on January

1, 2023.

In European

Union, the

General Data

Protection Regulation heightens

privacy compliance 
obligations

and

imposes

strict

standards

for

reporting

data

breaches.

We

expect

this

trend

to

continue

and

are

continually 
monitoring developments in the jurisdictions in which

we operate. 
See

“Puerto

Rico

Regulation”

below

for

a

description

of

legislations

and

regulations

on

information

privacy

and 
cybersecurity in Puerto Rico. 
Climate-Related and ESG Developments 
In

recent

years,

federal,

state

and

international

lawmakers

and

regulators

have

increased

their

focus

on

financial 
institutions’

and

other

companies’

risk

oversight,

disclosures

and

practices

in

connection

with

climate

change

and

other 
environmental, social and

governance (“ESG”) matters.

For example,

on October

24, 2023, the

Federal Reserve, FDIC,

and OCC 
finalized

interagency

guidance

on

principles

for

climate-related

financial

risk

management

applicable

to

regulated

financial 
institutions with more

than $100 billion

in total consolidated

assets. The principles

are intended to

support efforts by

large financial 
institutions to

focus on key

aspects of climate-related

financial risk management

and cover six

areas: (1)

governance; (2) policies, 
procedures,

and

limits; (3)

strategic planning;

(4)

risk

management; (5)

data,

risk measurement,

and reporting;

and

(6)

scenario 
analysis.

On

December

21,

2022,

the

NYSDFS

proposed

guidance

on

climate-related

financial

risk

management

applicable

to 
NYSDFS-regulated banking

and mortgage

organizations, including

PB.

The

proposed guidance

would address

material financial 
risks related to

climate change faced

by these organizations in

the context of

risk assessment, risk management,

and risk appetite 
setting. California recently enacted climate-related disclosure laws requiring certain companies doing business in California to make 
certain climate-related disclosures, including but not limited to greenhouse gas emissions data and climate-related risks. In addition, 
certain states have

enacted, or have

proposed to enact,

“anti-ESG” statutes, regulations or

policies, including statutes that

prohibit 
financial

institutions from

denying or

canceling products

or

services

to

a

person, or

otherwise discriminating

against a

person in 
making available products or services, on the basis

of social credit scores and certain other factors.

Incentive Compensation 
The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as

part of its regular,

risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation 
arrangements of

banking organizations, such

as Popular,

that are

not “large,

complex banking

organizations.” Deficiencies will

be 
incorporated into

the

organization’s supervisory

ratings, which

can

affect

the

organization’s ability

to

make

acquisitions and

take 
other

actions. Enforcement

actions may

be taken

against

a

banking

organization if

its

incentive compensation

arrangements, or 
related

risk-management

control

or

governance

processes,

pose

a

risk

to

the

organization’s

safety

and

soundness

and

the 
organization is not taking prompt and effective measures

to correct the deficiencies. 
The

Federal

Reserve

Board,

OCC

and

FDIC

have

issued

comprehensive

final

guidance

on

incentive

compensation 
policies intended to discourage excessive risk-taking in

the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations

in order to not 
undermine

the

safety

and

soundness

of

such

organizations.

The

guidance,

which

covers

all

employees

that

have

the

ability

to 
materially affect

the risk

profile of an

organization, either individually

or as

part of

a group,

is based

upon the key

principles that

a 
banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond 
the

organization’s

ability

to

effectively

identify

and

manage

risks,

(ii)

be

compatible

with

effective

internal

controls

and

risk 
management, and (iii)

be supported by

strong corporate governance,

including active and

effective oversight

by the

organization’s 
board of directors. 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking 
agencies

and

the

SEC,

to

adopt

rules

prohibiting

incentive-based

payment

arrangements that

encourage

inappropriate

risks

by 
providing excessive

compensation or

that could

lead to

a material

financial loss

at specified

regulated entities

having at

least $1 
billion in total

assets (including Popular,

PNA, BPPR and

PB). The U.S.

financial regulators proposed revised

rules in 2016,

which 
have not been finalized. 

22 
In October

2022, the SEC

adopted a final

rule requiring securities

exchanges to adopt

rules mandating, in

the case of

a 
restatement, the

recovery or

“clawback” of

excess incentive-based

compensation paid

to current

or former

executive officers

and 
requiring listed

issuers to

disclose any

recovery analysis where

recovery is

triggered by

a restatement.

The excess

compensation 
would be based

on the amount

the executive officer

would have received

had the incentive-based

compensation been determined 
using the restated

financials. The Nasdaq

Stock Market’s listing

standards pursuant to the

SEC’s rule became

effective October 2, 
2023. Popular’s clawback policy adopted in accordance

with these listing standards is included as

Exhibit 97.1. 
Regulation of Broker-Dealers
Our subsidiary,

PS, is a

registered broker-dealer with the

SEC and subject to

regulation and examination by

the SEC as 
well

as

FINRA

and

other

self-regulatory

organizations.

These

regulations

cover

a

broad

range

of

issues,

including

capital 
requirements;

sales

and

trading

practices;

use

of

client

funds

and

securities;

the

conduct

of

directors,

officers

and

employees; 
record-keeping and recording;

supervisory procedures to

prevent improper trading

on material

non-public information; qualification 
and

licensing

of

sales

personnel;

and

limitations

on

the

extension

of

credit

in

securities

transactions.

In

addition

to

federal 
registration, state securities

commissions require the

registration of certain

broker-dealers. PS is

registered with 35

U.S. state and 
territory securities commissions. 
Regulation of Reinsurers, Insurance Producers and

Agents
Popular’s subsidiaries that are engaged in

insurance agency and producer activities are

subject to regulatory supervision 
by the Puerto

Rico Office of

the Commissioner of Insurance

and to insurance laws

and regulations requiring licensing

of insurance 
producers and

agents. Popular’s

reinsurance subsidiaries

are subject

to

licensure and

regulatory supervision

by the

Puerto Rico 
Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and

to insurance laws and regulations requiring, among

other things, minimum capital and 
solvency standards, financial reporting, restrictions on

the amount of dividends payable, record

keeping and examinations. 
Puerto Rico Regulation 
As

a

commercial

bank

organized

under

the

laws

of

Puerto

Rico,

BPPR

is

subject

to

supervision,

examination

and 
regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended 
(the “Banking Law”). 
Section 27

of the

Banking Law

requires that

at

least ten

percent (10%)

of the

yearly net

income of

BPPR be

credited 
annually to a reserve

fund. The apportionment must be

done every year until the

reserve fund is equal to

the total of paid-in

capital 
on common and preferred stock. During 2024, $52.8

million was transferred to the statutory reserve

account. 
Section

27

of

the

Banking

Law

also

provides that

when

the

expenditures

of

a

bank

are

greater

than

its

receipts, the 
excess of the

former over the latter

must be charged against

the undistributed profits of

the bank, and the

balance, if any,

must be 
charged against

the reserve

fund.

If the

reserve fund

is

not sufficient

to

cover such

balance in

whole or

in part,

the outstanding 
amount must be charged against

the capital account and no

dividend may be declared until capital

has been restored to its

original 
amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original

capital. 
Section 16 of the

Banking Law requires every

bank to maintain a

legal reserve that, except

as otherwise provided by

the 
Office of

the Commissioner,

may not be

less than 20%

of its

demand liabilities, excluding

government deposits (federal,

state and 
municipal) that

are secured

by collateral.

If a

bank is

authorized to

establish one

or more

bank branches

in a

state of

the United 
States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state

or country, the Office of the 
Commissioner

may

exempt

said

branch

or

branches

from

the

reserve

requirements

of

Section

16.

Pursuant

to

an

order

of

the 
Federal

Reserve

Board

dated

November

24,

1982,

BPPR

has

been

exempted

from

the

reserve

requirements

of

the

Federal 
Reserve

System

with

respect

to

deposits

payable

in

Puerto

Rico.

Accordingly,

BPPR

is

subject

to

the

reserve

requirement 
prescribed by the Banking Law. During 2024, BPPR was in compliance

with the statutory reserve requirement. 
Section 17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to

any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an 
aggregate amount of

fifteen percent (15%)

of the paid-in

capital and reserve fund

of the bank.

As of December

31, 2024, the

legal 
lending limit

for BPPR

under this

provision was

approximately $349

million. In

the case

of loans

which are

secured by

collateral 
worth at

least 25% more

than the amount

of the

loan, the

maximum aggregate amount

of such secured

loans is

increased to

one 
third of

the paid-in capital

of the bank,

plus its reserve

fund. In no

event may the

total of unsecured

and secured loans

to any one 
person, firm, partnership or corporation exceed an aggregate amount of 33 1/3% of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. 

23 
If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated

1 in the last examination performed by the Office

of the Commissioner or any 
regulatory agency,

its legal

lending limit

shall also

include 15%

of 50%

of its

undivided profits

and for

loans secured

by collateral 
worth at

least 25%

more than

the amount

of the

loan, the

capital of

the bank

shall also

include 33

1/3% of

50% of

its undivided 
profits. Institutions rated 2

in their last

regulatory examination may include this

additional component in their

legal lending limit

only 
with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section 17 on the amount of loans 
that are wholly secured

by bonds, securities and

other evidence of indebtedness

of the Government of

the United States or

Puerto 
Rico,

or

by

current

debt

bonds,

not

in

default,

of

municipalities

or

instrumentalities

of

Puerto

Rico.

During

2024,

BPPR

was

in 
compliance with the lending limit requirements of Section

17 of the Banking Law. 
Section

14

of

the

Banking Law

authorizes a

bank to

conduct certain

financial

and

related

activities directly

or

through 
subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property and originating and servicing

mortgage loans. BPPR engages in finance 
leasing through

its wholly-owned

subsidiary,

Popular Auto,

LLC, which

is organized

and operates

in Puerto

Rico. The

origination 
and servicing of mortgage loans is conducted by

Popular Mortgage, a division of BPPR. 
With

respect to

information privacy,

Puerto

Rico

law

requires businesses

to

implement information

security

controls to 
protect consumers’

personal information from

breaches, as

well as to

provide notice of

any breach to

affected customers. In

2024 
Puerto

Rico

enacted the

Cybersecurity Act

of

the

Commonwealth of

Puerto

Rico,

which

establishes cybersecurity

standards for 
government entities

and their

contractors, including

certain reporting

and certification

obligations. As

a depositary

of government 
funds, BPPR

could be

considered a

“contractor” under

the statute;

however,

the Puerto

Rico Innovation

and Technology

Service 
has

not

yet

adopted

implementing

regulation

which

we

expect

to

address

applicability

and

any

exceptions

to

the

statute’s 
requirements.

In addition,

as noted

above in

“Regulation of

Reinsurers, Insurance

Producers and

Agents”, Popular’s

reinsurance 
subsidiaries are subject to

licensure and regulatory supervision

by the Puerto Rico

Office of the

Commissioner of Insurance and

to 
insurance laws and regulations.
