Item 2. Properties
While the Company generally leases its pawnshop locations, the Company also purchases real estate for its pawnshop locations as opportunities arise at prices that the Company believes are attractive, whether through new store acquisitions or through purchases from its landlords at existing stores. As of December 31, 2024, the Company owned the real estate and buildings for 400 of its pawn stores and its Company’s corporate headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.  
As of December 31, 2024, the Company leased 2,638 pawn store locations that were open or were in the process of opening. Leased facilities are generally leased for a term of three to five years with one or more options to renew. A majority of the store leases can be terminated early upon an adverse change in law which negatively affects the store’s profitability. The Company’s leases expire on dates ranging from 2025 to 2062. All store leases provide for specified periodic rental payments ranging from approximately $1,000 to $27,000 per month as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the Company leases call center space in Jamaica and Mexico to support the AFF customer service operations. For more information about the Company’s pawn store locations, see “
