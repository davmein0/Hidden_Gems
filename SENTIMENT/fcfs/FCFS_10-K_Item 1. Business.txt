Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $123.8 million, or 30%, from $416.1 million for 2023 to $540.0 million for 2024 due to net changes in certain non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to operating cash flow and net changes in other operating assets and liabilities (as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows) and an increase in net income of $39.5 million.
Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $20.7 million, or 4%, from $462.3 million during 2023 to $441.6 million during 2024. Cash flows from investing activities are utilized primarily to fund acquisitions, purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements, which includes capital expenditures for improvements to existing pawn stores and for new pawn store openings and other corporate assets, and discretionary purchases of store real property. In addition, cash flows related to the funding of new pawn loans, net of cash repayments and recovery of principal through the sale of inventories acquired from forfeiture of pawn collateral and changes in net finance receivables, are included in investing activities. The Company paid $68.2 million for furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and $86.1 million for discretionary pawn store real property purchases during 2024 compared to $60.1 million and $70.5 million in 2023, respectively. The Company paid $76.0 million in cash related to pawn store acquisitions during 2024 compared to $181.3 million during 2023. The Company funded a net increase in pawn loans of $72.0 million during 2024 and $35.0 million during 2023. The Company funded a net increase in finance receivables of $139.3 million during 2024 and $115.4 million during 2023.
Cash Flow Used in Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $89.5 million, or 174%, from net cash provided by financing activities of $51.3 million during 2023 to net cash used in financing activities of $38.2 million during 2024. Net payments on the credit facilities were $370.0 million during 2024 compared to net borrowings of $230.3 million during 2023. During 2024, the Company received $500.0 million in proceeds from the private offering of senior unsecured notes which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility, after payment of fees and expenses related to the offering. The Company paid debt issuance costs of $10.4 million during 2024 compared to $0.3 million during 2023. The Company funded $85.0 million for share repurchases and paid dividends of $65.8 million during 2024, compared to funding $114.4 million of share repurchases and dividends paid of $61.9 million during 2023. In addition, the Company paid withholding taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock awards during 2024 of $7.0 million compared to $2.5 million during 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
The Company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted retail POS payment solutions segment metrics and constant currency results as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the Company’s operating performance and period-over-period growth. The Company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than GAAP, primarily by excluding from a comparable GAAP measure certain items the Company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance. These financial calculations are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the SEC rules. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items, other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations. The Company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the Company’s core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the Company’s results of operations. However, items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, the Company’s GAAP financial measures. Further, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, the non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.
While acquisitions are an important part of the Company’s overall strategy, the Company has adjusted the applicable financial calculations to exclude merger and acquisition expenses and amortization of acquired AFF intangible assets. The Company does not consider these items to be related to the organic operations of the acquired businesses or its continuing operations and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses. In addition, excluding these items allows for more accurate comparisons of the financial results to prior periods. Merger and acquisition expenses include incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activities, including professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, contract breakage costs and costs related to the consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities, among others. 
The Company has certain leases in Mexico which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The lease liability of these U.S.-dollar-denominated leases, which is considered a monetary liability, is remeasured into Mexican pesos using current period exchange rates, resulting in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses. The Company has adjusted the applicable financial measures to exclude these remeasurement gains or losses (1) because they are non-cash, non-operating items that could create volatility in the Company’s consolidated results of operations due to the magnitude of the end of period lease liability being remeasured and (2) to improve comparability of current periods presented with prior periods.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share
Management believes the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding items that management believes are non-operating in nature and are not representative of the Company’s core operating performance. In addition, management believes the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company’s financial results for the current periods presented with the prior periods presented.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA
The Company defines EBITDA as net income before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and interest income and adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items, as listed below, that management considers to be non-operating in nature and not representative of its actual operating performance. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are commonly used by investors to assess a company’s financial performance, and adjusted EBITDA is used as a starting point in the calculation of the consolidated total debt ratio as defined in the Company’s senior unsecured notes.

Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow
For purposes of its internal liquidity assessments, the Company considers free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and improvements and net fundings/repayments of pawn loan and finance receivables, which are considered to be operating in nature by the Company but are included in cash flow from investing activities. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow adjusted for merger and acquisition expenses paid that management considers to be non-operating in nature.
Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are commonly used by investors as additional measures of cash, generated by business operations, that may be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and debt service or, following payment of such debt obligations and other non-discretionary items, that may be available to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay cash dividends or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. These metrics can also be used to evaluate the Company’s ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company’s liquidity. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities or other

Retail POS Payment Solutions Segment Purchase Accounting Adjustments
Management believes the presentation of certain retail POS payment solutions segment metrics, adjusted to exclude the impacts of purchase accounting, provides investors with greater transparency and provides a more complete understanding of AFF’s financial performance and prospects for the future by excluding the impacts of purchase accounting, which management believes is non-operating in nature and not representative of AFF’s core operating performance.

Constant Currency Results
The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, however, certain performance metrics discussed in this report are presented on a “constant currency” basis, which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company’s management uses constant currency results to evaluate operating results of business operations in Latin America, which are transacted in local currencies in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia. The Company also has operations in El Salvador, where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
The Company believes constant currency results provide valuable supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of its business operations in Latin America, consistent with how the Company’s management evaluates such performance and operating results. Constant currency results reported herein are calculated by translating certain balance sheet and income statement items denominated in local currencies using the exchange rate from the prior-year comparable period, as opposed to the current comparable period, in order to exclude the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations for purposes of

evaluating period-over-period comparisons. See the Latin America pawn segment tables in “Results of Operations” above for additional reconciliation of certain constant currency amounts to as reported GAAP amounts.

Effects of Inflation
While the impacts of inflation have been widely reported and may be ongoing into the foreseeable future, the Company does not believe inflation had a material effect on the Company’s overall results of operations in 2024. Depending on the severity and persistence of these inflationary pressures, the Company could see a negative impact on its customers’ ability to pay for its goods and services, including an impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable, which could result in increased charge-offs of AFF’s finance receivables and leased merchandise as well as increases in wages and other operating costs. However, inflationary economic environments could also benefit the Company by increasing customer demand for value-priced products, lending services in its pawn stores and demand for POS payment solutions provided by AFF.
Seasonality
The Company’s business is subject to seasonal variations, and operating results for each quarter and year-to-date periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year. Typically, the Company experiences seasonal growth of pawn service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to pawn loan balance growth. Pawn service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year after the typical repayment period of pawn loans due to statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S. In addition, AFF customers generally exercise the early buyout option on their existing lease or finance receivable more frequently during the first quarter due to tax refund proceeds. Retail sales are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter as a result of holiday shopping and, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter due to the disbursement of tax refunds in the U.S.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risks relating to the Company’s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, gold prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The impact of current-year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular, are further discussed in Part II, Item 7 herein. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Gold Price Risk
The Company has significant holdings of gold in the form of jewelry inventories and pawn collateral, and a significant portion of retail merchandise sales are gold jewelry, as are most of the wholesale scrap jewelry sales. At December 31, 2024, the Company held approximately $174.0 million in jewelry inventories, which were primarily gold, representing 52% of total inventory. In addition, approximately $336.6 million, or 65%, of total pawn loans were collateralized by jewelry, which was also primarily gold. Of the Company’s total retail merchandise revenue during 2024, approximately $602.8 million, or 40%, was from jewelry sales. During 2024, the average market price of gold increased by 23% from $1,942 to $2,385 per ounce. The price of gold at December 31, 2024 was $2,609 per ounce compared to $2,078 at December 31, 2023. A significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of jewelry inventories held by the Company and the value of gold jewelry pledged as collateral by pawn customers. As a result, the Company’s profit margins from the sale of existing jewelry inventories could be negatively impacted, as could the potential profit margins on gold jewelry currently pledged as collateral by pawn customers if forfeited by the customer. In addition, a decline in gold prices could result in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the Company, as customers generally would receive lower loan amounts for individual pieces of pledged gold jewelry, although the Company believes that many customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount, thus mitigating a portion of this risk.  
Foreign Currency Risk
The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity under the caption “currency translation adjustment.” Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses in the Company’s income statement as incurred. The Company also has operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. 
On a dollar-translated basis, Latin America revenues and cost of revenues accounted for 24% and 22%, respectively, of consolidated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2024. The majority of Latin America revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and the Company, therefore, has foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the Mexican peso, and, to a much lesser extent, the Guatemalan quetzal and Colombian peso.
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company’s revenue and earnings of its Latin America pawn operations as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s Latin America revenues and pre-tax operating income would have been approximately $21.3 million and $3.6 million higher, respectively, had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2023. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” for further discussion of Latin America constant currency results.
The Company does not use long-term foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that it cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. The Company’s continued Latin America expansion increases exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and, as a result, such fluctuations could have a significant impact on future results of operations. The average value of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate for 2024 was 18.3 to 1 compared to 17.8 to 1 in 2023 and 20.1 to 1 in 2022. A one-point change in the average Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate would have impacted 2024 annual earnings by approximately $3.4 million. The impact of foreign exchange rates in Guatemala and Colombia is not material to the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Interest Rate Risk
The Company is potentially exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk for its long-term unsecured lines of credit. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $198.0 million outstanding under its U.S. revolving line of credit. The revolving lines of credit are generally priced with a variable rate based on a fixed spread over SOFR or the Mexican Central Bank’s interbank equilibrium rate (“TIIE”) and repriced with any changes in SOFR or TIIE. Based on the $198.0 million in outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2024, a 1% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have increased the Company’s annual interest expense by approximately $2.0 million for 2024. 
Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect the Company’s future earnings or cash flows on its fixed rate debt unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate instruments. At December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt was approximately $1,503.0 million and the outstanding principal of the Company’s fixed rate debt was $1,550.0 million. The fair value estimate of the Company’s fixed rate debt was estimated based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on this estimated fair value. As the Company has the ability to hold its fixed rate instruments to maturity, and the amounts due under such instruments would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, the Company does not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of its fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on the Company’s operations.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are sometimes invested in money market accounts. Accordingly, the Company is subject to changes in market interest rates. However, the Company does not believe a change in these rates would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024 (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls will prevent all possible error and fraud. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are, however, designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (3) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorization of management and the board of directors, and (4) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. To make this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of FirstCash Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited FirstCash Holdings, Inc.’s (the Company’s) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and our report dated February 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of FirstCash Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FirstCash Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated February 3, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for loan losses—finance receivables
As described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company established an allowance for loan losses on its finance receivables of $117.0 million as of December 31, 2024, which was estimated using the Company’s expected lifetime loss model. Loan losses on finance receivables were estimated and recognized upon purchase of the receivable, based on expected loan losses for the full contractual life of the finance receivable. The Company’s expected lifetime loss model segmented the finance receivable population into monthly pools of receivable origination vintages by loan product and estimated the allowance for loan losses by applying modeled loss rates derived from historical loss information. The Company then adjusted the historical loss information for observable and forecasted economic conditions and qualitative factors to address recent and forecasted business trends including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices.
The determination of the allowance for loan losses on finance receivables was subjective and required management to make significant judgements related to the selection and application of modeled loss rates, the incorporation of observable and forecasted economic conditions, and adjustments to address recent and forecasted business trends. We identified the allowance for loan losses on finance receivable portfolios as a critical audit matter as auditing the judgements surrounding the selection of modeled loss rates, incorporation of observable and forecasted economic conditions, and adjustments to address recent and forecasted business trends, was complex and required a high degree of auditor judgement and subjectivity.
F-1

Table of Contents
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s allowance for loan losses on finance receivables, specifically the selection and application of modeled loss rates and adjustments to address recent and forecasted business trends, included the following, among others:
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the allowance for loan losses, including the application of modeled loss rates, observable and forecasted economic conditions and qualitative factors and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls related to management’s review of the observable and forecasted economic conditions, qualitative factors and application of modeled loss rates and approval of the allowance for loan losses calculation.
•
We tested the completeness and accuracy of data inputs into the expected lifetime loss model, including historical monthly origination balances and loss rates, by tracing to internal source documents.
•
We evaluated key assumptions and judgements surrounding the selection of modeled loss rates and adjustments to address recent and forecasted business trends, including delinquency rates, for reasonableness by comparing to internal source data.
Allowance for lease losses—leased merchandise
As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company established an allowance for lease losses on its portfolio of leased merchandise of $80.3 million as of December 31, 2024, representing estimated losses expected on its lease agreements. The Company estimated this allowance based on historical loss experience and gave consideration to recent and forecasted business trends including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices.
The determination of the allowance for lease losses on leased merchandise was subjective and required management to make significant judgements related to the selection and application of historical loss experience and adjustments for recent and forecasted business trends. We identified the allowance for lease losses on leased merchandise as a critical audit matter as auditing the judgements surrounding the selection and application of historical loss experience and adjustments for recent and forecasted business trends was complex and required a high degree of auditor judgement and subjectivity.
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s allowance for lease losses on leased merchandise, specifically the selection and application of historical loss experience and adjustments for recent and forecasted business trends, included the following, among others:
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the allowance for lease losses, including the adjustments for recent and forecasted business trends and application of historical loss experience, and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls related to management’s review of the adjustments for recent and forecasted business trends and application of historical loss experience and approval of the allowance for lease losses calculation.
•
We tested the completeness and accuracy of data inputs into the allowance for lease losses model, including historical loss experience, by tracing to internal source documents.
•
We evaluated key assumptions and judgements surrounding the selection of historical loss experience and adjustments for recent and forecasted business trends for reasonableness by comparing to internal source data.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - 
GENERAL 
Organization and Nature of the Company
FirstCash Holdings, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) is incorporated in the state of Delaware. The Company operates 
two
 business lines: pawn operations and retail POS payment solutions, which are organized into 
three
 reportable segments. The U.S. pawn segment consists of pawn operations in 
29
 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, while the Latin America pawn segment consists of pawn operations in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Colombia. The retail POS payment solutions segment consists of the operations of AFF in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
The Company’s primary line of business is the operation of retail pawn stores, also known as “pawnshops,” which focus on serving cash- and credit-constrained consumers. Pawn stores help customers meet small short-term cash needs by providing non-recourse pawn loans and buying merchandise directly from customers. Personal property, such as jewelry, electronics, tools, appliances, sporting goods and musical instruments, is pledged and held as collateral for the pawn loans over the typical 30-day term of the loan. Pawn stores also generate retail sales primarily from the merchandise acquired through collateral forfeitures and over-the-counter purchases from customers.
The Company’s retail POS payment solutions business line consists solely of the operations of AFF, which it acquired in 2021. AFF focuses on LTO products and facilitating other retail financing payment options across a large network of traditional and e-commerce merchant partners. AFF’s retail partners provide consumer goods and services to their customers and use AFF’s LTO and retail finance solutions to facilitate payments on such transactions.
NOTE 2 - 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements:
Principles of consolidation
 — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FirstCash Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company regularly makes acquisitions, and the results of operations for the acquisitions have been consolidated since the acquisition dates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Cash and cash equivalents
 — The Company considers any highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was $
70.9
 million, which is primarily held in Mexican pesos.

Pawn loans and revenue recognition
 — Pawn loans are secured by the customer’s pledge of tangible personal property, which the Company holds during the term of the loan. If a pawn loan defaults, the Company relies on the sale of the pawned property to recover the principal amount of an unpaid pawn loan, plus a yield on the investment, as the Company’s pawn loans are non-recourse against the customer. The Company accrues pawn loan fee revenue on a constant-yield basis over the life of the pawn loan for all pawns for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical pawn redemption statistics, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If the pawn loan is not repaid prior to the expiration of the pawn loan term, including any extension or grace period, if applicable, the principal amount loaned becomes the inventory carrying value of the forfeited collateral, which is typically recovered through sales of the forfeited items at prices well above the carrying value. The Company has determined no allowance related to credit losses on pawn loans is required as the fair value of the pledged collateral is significantly in excess of the pawn loan amount.  
Pawn inventories and revenue recognition
 — Pawn inventories represent merchandise acquired from forfeited pawn loans and merchandise purchased directly from the general public. The Company also retails limited quantities of new or refurbished merchandise obtained directly from wholesalers and manufacturers. Pawn inventories from forfeited pawn loans are recorded at the amount of the pawn principal on the unredeemed goods, exclusive of accrued interest. Pawn inventories purchased directly from customers, wholesalers and manufacturers are recorded at cost. The cost of pawn inventories is determined on the specific identification method. Pawn inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and, accordingly, valuation allowances are established if pawn inventory carrying values are in excess of estimated selling prices, net of direct costs of disposal. Management has evaluated pawn inventories and determined that a valuation allowance is not necessary.
F-11

Table of Contents
The Company’s merchandise sales are primarily retail sales to the general public in its pawn stores. The Company records sales revenue at the time of the sale. The Company presents merchandise sales net of any sales or value-added taxes collected. Some jewelry inventory is melted and processed at third-party facilities and the precious metal and diamond content is sold at either prevailing market commodity prices or a previously agreed upon price with a commodity buyer. The Company records revenue from these wholesale scrap jewelry transactions when a price has been agreed upon and the Company ships the commodity to the buyer.
Layaway plan and deferred revenue
 — Customers can purchase merchandise on an interest-free “layaway” plan. Should the customer fail to make a required payment pursuant to a layaway plan, the item is returned to pawn inventory and all or a portion of previous payments are typically forfeited to the Company. Deposits and interim payments from customers on layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recorded as retail merchandise sales revenue when the merchandise is delivered to the customer upon receipt of final payment or when previous payments are forfeited to the Company. Layaway payments from customers are included in customer deposits and prepayments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
Leased merchandise and revenue recognition
 — The Company provides merchandise, consisting primarily of furniture and mattresses, appliances, jewelry, electronics and automotive products, to customers of its merchant partners for lease under certain terms agreed to by the customer. The customer has the right to acquire the title either through an early buyout option or through payment of all required lease payments. The Company maintains ownership of the leased merchandise until all payment obligations are satisfied under the lease agreement. The customer has the right to cancel the lease at any time by returning the merchandise. Leased merchandise contracts can typically be renewed for weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly renewal periods and are generally renewed for between 
six
 and 
24
 months. Leased merchandise is stated at depreciated cost. The Company depreciates leased merchandise over the life of the lease and assumes 
no
 salvage value. Depreciation is accelerated upon an early buyout. All of the Company’s leased merchandise represents on-lease merchandise and all leases are operating leases.
Lease income is recognized over the lease term and is recorded net of any sales taxes collected. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. Initial direct costs related to the Companyʼs lease agreements are added to the basis of the leased property and recognized over the lease term in proportion to the recognition of lease income. The Company typically charges the customer a non-refundable processing fee at lease inception and may also receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for leases originated at their locations, which are deferred and amortized using the straight-line method as adjustments to lease income over the contractual life of the related leased merchandise. Unamortized fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early buyout or charge-off.
The Company accrues for lease income earned but not yet collected as accrued rent receivable, which is included in accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Alternatively, lease payments received in excess of the amount earned are recognized as deferred revenue, which is included in customer deposits and prepayments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Customer payments are first applied to applicable sales tax and scheduled lease payments, then applied to any uncollected fees, such as late fees and insufficient fund fees. The Company collects sales taxes on behalf of the customer and remits all applicable sales taxes collected to the respective jurisdiction.
Provision for lease losses 
— The Company records a provision for lease losses on an allowance method, which estimates the leased merchandise losses incurred but not yet identified by management as of the end of the accounting period. The allowance for lease losses is based primarily upon historical loss experience with consideration given to recent and forecasted business trends including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices. 
The Company charges off leased merchandise when a lease is 
90
 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the leased merchandise at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible. 
Finance receivables and revenue recognition 
— The Company purchases and services retail finance receivables, the term of which typically ranges from 
six
 to 
24
 months, directly from its merchant partners or from its bank partner. The Company has a partnership with a Utah state-chartered bank that requires the Company to purchase the rights to the cash flows associated with finance receivables marketed to retail consumers on the bank’s behalf. The bank establishes the underwriting criteria for the finance receivables originated by the bank.
Interest income is recognized using the interest method over the life of the finance receivable for all loans for which the Company deems collection to be probable based on historical loan redemption statistics and stops accruing interest upon charge-off. Accrued interest, net of an allowance for uncollectible interest income, is included in 
accounts receivable, net
 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
10.0
 million and $
12.8
 million,

respectively. Charges for late fees and insufficient fund fees are recognized as income when collected. The Company receives an origination fee on newly purchased bank loans and may receive a discount from or pay a premium to certain merchant partners for finance receivables purchased from them, which are deferred and amortized using the interest method as adjustments to yield over the contractual life of the related finance receivable. Unamortized origination fees, discounts and premiums are recognized in full upon early payoff or charge-off.
The Company offers customers an early payoff discount on most of its finance receivables, whereby the customer has between  
90
 and 
101
 days to pay the full principal balance without incurring any interest charge. If the borrower does not pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period, interest charges are applied retroactively to the inception date of the loan. The Company accrues interest income during the early payoff discount period but records a reserve for loans expected to pay the full principal balance prior to the expiration of the early payoff discount period based on historical payment patterns.
Provision for loan losses 
— Expected lifetime losses on finance receivables are recognized upon loan purchase, which requires the Company to make its best estimate of probable lifetime losses at the time of purchase. The Company segments its finance receivable portfolio into pools of receivables with similar risk characteristics which include loan product and monthly origination vintage and evaluates each pool for impairment.
The Company calculates the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss information and incorporates observable and forecasted economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period covering the full contractual life of finance receivables. Incorporating observable and forecasted economic conditions could have a material impact on the measurement of the allowance to the extent that forecasted economic conditions change significantly. The Company may also consider other qualitative factors to address recent and forecasted business trends in estimating the allowance, as necessary, including, but not limited to, loss trends, delinquency levels, economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to cover expected lifetime losses on the finance receivable portfolio, and the appropriateness of the allowance is evaluated at each period end.
The Company charges off finance receivables when a receivable is 
90
 days or more contractually past due. If an account is deemed to be uncollectible prior to this date, the Company will charge off the finance receivable at the point in time it is deemed uncollectible.

Foreign currency transactions
 — The Company has pawn operations in Latin America, where in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia, the functional currency is the Mexican peso, Guatemalan quetzal and Colombian peso. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date, and the resulting adjustments are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates occurring during the respective period. Prior to translation, U.S.-dollar-denominated transactions of the foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into their functional currency using current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Gains and losses from remeasurement of dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities in Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia are included in loss (gain) on foreign exchange in the consolidated statements of income. Deferred taxes are not currently recorded on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments as the Company indefinitely reinvests earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company also has pawn operations in El Salvador where the reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
The average value of the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate for 2024 was 
18.3

 compared to 
17.8

Operating expenses
 — Costs incurred in operating the Company’s pawn stores have been classified as operating expenses, which include salary and benefit expense of pawn store-level employees, occupancy costs, bank charges, security, insurance, utilities, supplies and other costs incurred by the pawn stores. Additionally, costs incurred in operating AFF have been classified as operating expenses, which include salary and benefit expense of certain operations focused departments, merchant partner incentives, bank and other payment processing charges, credit reporting costs, information technology costs, advertising costs and other operational costs incurred.
F-13

Table of Contents
Property and equipment
 — Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method generally based on estimated useful lives of 
30
 to 
40
 years for buildings and 
three
 to 
five years
 for furniture, fixtures and equipment. The costs of improvements on leased pawn stores are capitalized as leasehold improvements and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the applicable lease period, or useful life, if shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and renewals and betterments are charged to the appropriate property and equipment accounts. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations in the period the assets are sold or retired.
Business combinations
 — Business combination accounting requires the Company to determine the fair value of all assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. The total consideration of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability as of the acquisition date, and any remaining acquisition consideration is classified as goodwill. This allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions. When appropriate, the Company utilizes independent valuation experts to advise and assist in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with a business acquisition, in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for identified intangible assets and in determining the fair value of contingent consideration, which is reviewed at each subsequent reporting period with changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 3.
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
 — Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in each business combination. The Company performs its goodwill impairment assessment annually as of October 1, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company’s reporting units, which are tested for impairment, are U.S. pawn, Latin America pawn and retail POS payment solutions. The Company may assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level by first assessing a range of qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to the quantitative impairment testing methodology, or at the Company’s option, it may proceed directly to the quantitative impairment testing methodology for a reporting unit. See Note 14.
The Company’s other material indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names and pawn licenses. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount. See Note 14.
Merger and acquisition expenses 
— The Company incurs incremental costs directly associated with merger and acquisition activity, including, but not limited to, professional fees, legal expenses, severance, retention and other employee-related costs, contract breakage costs and costs related to consolidation of technology systems and corporate facilities. The Company presents merger and acquisition expenses separately in the consolidated statements of income to identify these incremental activities apart from the expenses incurred to operate the business.

Long-lived assets
 — Property and equipment, intangible assets subject to amortization and non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest and income taxes) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset. Generally, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset and the estimated fair value of the related asset. 
The Company did not record any material impairment loss for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Fair value of financial instruments
 — The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques, as appropriate. Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. All fair value measurements related to acquisitions are level 3, non-recurring measurements, based on unobservable inputs. Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair values of financial instruments approximate their recorded values, due primarily to their short-term nature. See Note 6.
F-14

Table of Contents
Income taxes
 — The Company uses the asset and liability method of computing deferred income taxes on all material temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. See Note 12.
Advertising
 — The Company expenses the costs of advertising when incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $
3.7
 million, $
4.3
 million and $
4.1
 million, respectively.
Share-based compensation
 — All share-based payments to employees and directors are recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date or if applicable, the subsequent modification date fair value. The Company recognizes compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures and recognizes the compensation cost for only those awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. The Company records share-based compensation cost as an administrative expense. See Note 15.
Forward sales commitments
 — The Company periodically uses forward sale agreements with a major gold bullion bank to sell a portion of the expected amount of scrap gold, which is typically jewelry that is broken or of low retail value, produced in the normal course of business from its liquidation of such merchandise. These commitments qualify for an exemption from derivative accounting as normal sales, based on historical terms, conditions and quantities, and are therefore not recorded on the Company's balance sheet.

Earnings per share
 — Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. The Company used the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share which gives effect to the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised and converted into common shares during the year.  
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Use of estimates
 — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and related revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s estimates. Significant estimates include the accrual for earned but uncollected pawn fees, allowances for lease and loan losses and related lease and loan loss provisions, valuation of acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration of acquisitions, evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Recent accounting pronouncements
 — In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-06, “ Disclosure Agreements – Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative” (“ASU 2023-06”). ASU 2023-06 will align the disclosure and presentation requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification with the SEC’s regulations. The amendments in ASU 2023-06 will be applied prospectively and are effective when the SEC removes the related requirements from Regulations S-X or S-K. Any amendments the SEC does not remove by June 30, 2027 will not be

effective. As the Company is currently subject to these SEC requirements, ASU 2023-06 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s current financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”).  ASU 2023-07 expands disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and requires more enhanced information about a reportable segment’s expenses, interim segment profit or loss, and how a public entity’s chief operating decision maker uses reported segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2023-07 should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material effect on the Company’s current financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures. See Note 17.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 expands disclosures in the rate reconciliation and requires disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2023-09 should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-09 to have a material effect on the Company’s current financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No 2024-02, “Codification Improvements - Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements” (“ASU 2024-02”). ASU 2024-02 removes references to various Concepts Statements. In most instances, the references are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. ASU 2024-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2024-02 can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU 2024-02 effective January 1, 2024 on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2024-02 did not have a material effect on the Company’s current financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 requires additional disclosure of specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2024-03 may be applied either prospectively with the option for retrospective application for all prior periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the Company's current financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.

ACQUISITIONS 
2024 Pawn Acquisitions
Consistent with the Company’s strategy to continue its expansion of pawn stores in selected markets, during 2024, the Company acquired 
28
 pawn stores in the U.S. in 
five
 separate transactions, 
10
 pawn stores in Mexico in a separate transaction and acquired 
one
 pawn license that was used to open 
one
 new pawn store in the state of Nevada. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions totaled $
107.6
 million, net of cash acquired and subject to future post-closing adjustments. The aggregate purchase price was composed of $
75.0
 million in cash paid during 2024, $
29.3
 million in stock consideration and remaining short-term amounts payable to certain of the sellers of $
3.3
 million. During 2024, the Company also paid $
1.0
 million of purchase price amounts payable related to prior-year pawn acquisitions.
The purchase price of each of the 2024 acquisitions was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. The goodwill arising from these acquisitions consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company and the pawn stores acquired. These acquisitions were not material individually or in the aggregate to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The results of operations for the 2024 Pawn Acquisitions have been consolidated since the respective acquisition dates. During 2024, revenue from the 2024 Pawn Acquisitions was $
36.1
 million and the earnings from the 2024 Pawn Acquisitions since the acquisition dates (including $
1.7
 million of transaction costs, net of tax) was approximately $
7.2
 million. Transaction costs associated with the 2024 Pawn Acquisitions were expensed as incurred and are presented in the consolidated statements of income as merger and acquisition expenses. These expenses include investment banking, legal, accounting and other related third-party costs. Unaudited pro forma financial information reflecting the consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the 2024 Pawn Acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2023 has not been presented as the 2024 Pawn Acquisitions were not significant in relation to the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
2023 Pawn Acquisitions
During 2023, the Company acquired 
91
 pawn stores in the U.S. in 
eight
 separate transactions and acquired 
two
 pawn licenses that were used to open 
two
 new pawn stores in the state of Nevada. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions totaled $
178.6
 million, net of cash acquired. The aggregate purchase price was composed of $
178.0
 million in cash paid at closing, which included the repayment and extinguishment of $
59.7
 million of debt of the acquired businesses at closing and remaining short-term amounts payable to certain of the sellers of approximately $
0.6
 million.

NOTE 4 - 
OPERATING LEASES 
Lessor
Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the Company’s revenue generating activities as a lessor. All of the Company’s lease agreements are considered operating leases.
Lessee
The Company leases approximately 
67
% of its U.S. pawnshop locations, the majority of its Latin America pawnshop locations and certain administrative offices under operating leases and determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Many leases include both lease and non-lease components for which the Company accounts separately. Lease components include rent, taxes and insurance costs while non-lease components include common area or other maintenance costs. Operating leases are included in operating lease right of use assets, lease liability, current and lease liability, non-current in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have any finance leases.
Leased facilities are generally leased for a term of 
three
 to 
five years
 with one or more options to renew for an additional 
three
 to 
five years
, typically at the Company’s sole discretion. In addition, the majority of these leases can be terminated early upon an adverse change in law which negatively affects the store’s profitability. The Company regularly evaluates renewal and termination options to determine if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and excludes these options from the lease term included in the recognition of the operating lease right of use asset and lease liability until such certainty exists. The weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 
4.1
 years, 
3.9
 years and 
4.1
 years, respectively.
The operating lease right of use asset and lease liability is recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company utilizes a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate to apply to groups of leases with similar characteristics. The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the lease liability as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 
8.5
%, 
8.0
% and 
6.5
%, respectively.
The Company has certain operating leases in Mexico which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The liability related to these leases is considered a monetary liability, and requires remeasurement each reporting period into the functional currency (Mexican pesos) using reporting date exchange rates. The remeasurement results in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses each reporting period, which can produce a certain level of earnings volatility. The Company recognized a foreign currency loss of $
3.8
 million, gain of $
2.5
 million and gain of $
1.3
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the remeasurement of these U.S.-dollar-denominated operating leases, which is included in loss (gain) on foreign exchange in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with variable lease expense recognized in the period such payments are incurred. 
The following table details the components of lease expense included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

721,000
 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $
85.0
 million and an average cost per share of $
117.90
. The aggregate cost and average cost per share does not include the effect of the 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Company incurred $
0.9
 million of excise taxes during 2024. During 2023, the Company repurchased 
1,248,000
 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $
114.4

The 2024 shares were repurchased by the Company in a privately negotiated transaction with AFF Services, Inc. AFF Services, Inc. is partially owned and 
100
% controlled by the Douglas R. Rippel Revocable Trust (the "Trust"). Douglas R. Rippel, a member of the Company’s board of directors at the time of the transaction, is a co-trustee of the Trust and an indirect beneficial owner of the shares held by AFF Services, Inc. The $
117.90
 per share purchase price represented a discount to the average closing sale price of the Company's common stock for the three, five and ten days ended May 22, 2024.
In July 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for up to $
200.0
 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, of which $
115.0
 million is currently remaining. The Company intends to continue repurchases under its active share repurchase program, including through open market transactions under trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act subject to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, liquidity needs, credit availability, debt covenant restrictions, general business and economic conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of the Company’s stock, the Company’s dividend policy and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. 
Total cash dividends paid in 2024 and 2023 were $
65.8
 million and $
61.9
 million, respectively. The amount, declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be made by the Board, from time to time, subject to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, compliance with legal requirements, debt covenant restrictions and other relevant factors.

NOTE 6 - 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques, as appropriate. Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The three fair value levels are (from highest to lowest):
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
T
he Company did not have any financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis

Finance receivables, gross as of December 31, 2023 was $
227.5
 million. See Note 7.
As cash and cash equivalents have maturities of less than three months, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. Due to their short-term maturities, the carrying value of pawn loans and accounts receivable, net approximate fair value. 
Finance receivables are measured at amortized cost, net of an allowance for loan losses on the consolidated balance sheets. In estimating fair value for finance receivables, the Company utilized a discounted cash flow methodology. The Company used various unobservable inputs reflecting its own assumptions, such as contractual future principal and interest cash flows, future charge-off rates and discount rates (which consider current interest rates and are adjusted for credit risk, among other factors).
The carrying value of the unsecured credit facilities approximate fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The fair value of the unsecured credit facilities is estimated based on market values for debt issuances with similar characteristics or rates currently available for debt with similar terms. In addition, the unsecured credit facilities have a variable interest rate based on SOFR or TIIE and reprice with any changes in SOFR or TIIE. The fair value of the senior unsecured notes is estimated based on quoted prices in markets that are not active.

Revolving Unsecured Credit Facility
During the period from January 1, 2024 through August 8, 2024, the Company maintained an unsecured line of credit with a group of U.S.-based commercial lenders (the “Credit Facility”) in the amount of $
640.0
 million, which was scheduled to mature on August 30, 2027. The Credit Facility charged interest, at the Company’s option, of either (1) the prevailing SOFR (with interest periods of 1, 3 or 6 months at the Company’s option) plus a fixed spread of 
2.5
% and a fixed SOFR adjustment of 
0.1
%  or (2) the prevailing prime or base rate plus a fixed spread of 
1.5
%.
On August 8, 2024, the Credit Facility was amended (the “2024 Amendment”) in order to increase the total lender commitment, extend the term of the Credit Facility, amend certain financial covenants and modify the benchmark interest rate. Under the 2024 Amendment, the total lender commitment was increased from $
640.0
 million to $
700.0
 million and the term of the Credit Facility was extended to August 8, 2029. In addition, the permitted consolidated leverage ratio was increased to 
3.25
 times adjusted EBITDA for the full term of the agreement, while the other financial covenants remain substantially unchanged. 
The Credit Facility, as amended by the 2024 Amendment, now bears interest at the Company’s option of either (1) the prevailing SOFR (with interest periods of 1, 3 or 6 months at the Company’s option) plus a fixed spread of 
2.5
% or (2) the prevailing prime or base rate plus a fixed spread of 
1.5
%.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
198.0
 million in outstanding borrowings and $
2.7
 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility, leaving $
499.3
 million available for future borrowings, subject to certain financial covenants. The agreement has a SOFR floor of 
0
%. Additionally, the Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 
0.325
% on the average daily unused portion of the Credit Facility commitment. The weighted-average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2024 was 
6.86
% based on 1-month SOFR. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain financial covenants. The Credit Facility also contains customary restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make investments, consummate acquisitions and similar negative covenants with customary carve-outs and baskets. The Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, the Company made net payments of $
370.0
 million pursuant to the Credit Facility.
Revolving Unsecured Uncommitted Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s primary subsidiary in Mexico, First Cash S.A. de C.V., maintained an unsecured and uncommitted line of credit guaranteed by FirstCash, Inc. with a bank in Mexico (the “Mexico Credit Facility”) in the amount of $
600.0
 million Mexican pesos. The Mexico Credit Facility bears interest at TIIE plus a fixed spread of 
2.25
% and matures on August 24, 2027. Under the terms of the Mexico Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Mexico Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 amount outstanding under the Mexico Credit Facility and $
29.6
 million ($
600.0
 million pesos) available for future borrowings.

Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2028
On August 26, 2020, the Company issued $
500.0
 million of 
4.625
% senior unsecured notes due on September 1, 2028 (the “2028 Notes”), all of which are currently outstanding. Interest on the 2028 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1. The 2028 Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem its outstanding $
300.0
 million, 
5.375
% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), to repay a portion of the Credit Facility and to pay for related fees and expenses associated with the offering and the redemption of the 2024 Notes. 
The 2028 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis jointly and severally by all of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its Credit Facility. The 2028 Notes will permit the Company to make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's consolidated total debt ratio is less than 
2.75
 to 1. The consolidated total debt ratio is defined generally in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes (the “2028 Notes Indenture”) as the ratio of (1) the total consolidated debt of the Company minus cash and cash equivalents of the Company to (2) the Company’s consolidated trailing twelve months EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and giving pro forma effect to operations acquired during the measurement period. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated total debt ratio was 
2.7
 to 1. While the 2028 Notes generally limit the Company’s ability to make restricted payments if the consolidated total debt ratio is greater than 
2.75
 to 1, restricted payments are allowable within certain permitted baskets, which currently provides the Company with continued flexibility to make restricted payments when the Company’s consolidated total debt ratio is greater than 
2.75
 to 1.
The Company may redeem some or all of the 2028 Notes at any time on or after September 1, 2023, at the redemption prices set forth in the 2028 Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If the Company sells certain assets or consummates certain change in control transactions, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2028 Notes.
Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2030
On December 13, 2021, the Company issued $
550.0
 million of 
5.625
% senior unsecured notes due on January 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), all of which are currently outstanding. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1. The 2030 Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to finance the cash consideration and transaction expenses for the AFF acquisition, including the repayment, in full, of the outstanding debt under AFF’s credit facility at the closing of the AFF acquisition, payment of fees and expenses related to the offering and reduction of the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility. 
The 2030 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis jointly and severally by all of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its Credit Facility. The 2030 Notes will permit the Company to make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's consolidated total debt ratio is less than 
3.0
 to 1. The consolidated total debt ratio is defined generally in the indenture governing the 2030 Notes (the “2030 Notes Indenture”) as the ratio of (1) the total consolidated debt of the Company minus cash and cash equivalents of the Company to (2) the Company’s consolidated trailing twelve months EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and giving pro forma effect to operations acquired during the measurement period. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated total debt ratio was 
2.7
 to 1. While the 2030 Notes generally limit the Company’s ability to make restricted payments if the consolidated total debt ratio is greater than 
3.0
 to 1, restricted payments are allowable within certain permitted baskets, which currently provides the Company with continued flexibility to make restricted payments when the Company’s consolidated total debt ratio is greater than

The Company may redeem some or all of the 2030 Notes at any time on or after January 1, 2025, at the redemption prices set forth in the 2030 Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If the Company sells certain assets or consummates certain change in control transactions, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2030 Notes.

Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2032
On February 21, 2024, the Company issued $
500.0
 million of 
6.875
% senior unsecured notes due on March 1, 2032 (the “2032 Notes”), all of which are currently outstanding. Interest on the 2032 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, commencing on September 1, 2024. The 2032 Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility, after payment of fees and expenses related to the offering. The Company capitalized $
9.1
 million in debt issuance costs, which consisted primarily of the initial purchaser’s discount and fees and legal and other professional expenses. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the 2032 Notes as a component of interest expense and are carried as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the 2032 Notes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The 2032 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis jointly and severally by all of the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee its Credit Facility. The 2032 Notes will permit the Company to make restricted payments, such as purchasing shares of its stock and paying cash dividends, in an unlimited amount if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of any indebtedness to make such payment, the Company's consolidated total debt ratio is less than

The Company may redeem some or all of the 2032 Notes at any time on or after March 1, 2027, at the redemption prices set forth in the 2032 Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, prior to March 1, 2027, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2032 Notes at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium set forth in the 2032 Notes Indenture. The Company may redeem up to 
40
% of the 2032 Notes on or prior to March 1, 2027 with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in the 2032 Notes Indenture. If the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries sells certain assets or if the Company consummates certain change in control transactions, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2032 Notes.

Includes the allocation of certain administrative expenses and intercompany payments, such as royalties, management fees and interest, between domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was $
259.3
 million. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and generally eliminated U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries with the exception of foreign withholding taxes and other foreign local tax. During 2023, the Company repatriated $
31.0
 million from certain foreign subsidiaries, which was not subject to withholding or federal income tax. It is the Company’s intent to indefinitely reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings and future earnings of certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. and, therefore, deferred taxes are not currently recorded on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. For those subsidiaries where the company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment of the remaining undistributed earnings and future earnings, there are no deferred taxes which to record.

The Company’s foreign pawn operating subsidiaries are subject to their respective foreign statutory rates, which differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate. The statutory tax rates in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and El Salvador are 
30
%, 
25
%, 
35
% and 
30
%, respectively.  
The Company reviews the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 
fifty
 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities that could arise would be classified as interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits and, therefore, the Company did 
no
t have a liability for accrued interest and penalties and 
no
 such interest or penalties were incurred for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
The Company files federal income tax returns in the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica and Puerto Rico, as well as multiple state and local income tax returns in the U.S. The Company’s U.S. federal returns are not subject to examination for tax years prior to 2021. The majority of the Company’s U.S. state income tax returns are not subject to examination for the tax years prior to 2021. With respect to federal tax returns in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica and Puerto Rico, the tax years prior to 2019 are closed to examination. There are no state income taxes in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica or Puerto Rico.

NOTE 13 - 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Litigation
The Company, in the ordinary course of business, is a party to various legal and regulatory proceedings and other general claims. Although no assurances can be given, in management’s opinion, such outstanding proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to all of the claims described below and intends to vigorously defend itself against such claims. However, legal and regulatory proceedings involve an inherent level of uncertainty and no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome of any such matters or whether an adverse outcome would not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. At this stage, the Company is unable to determine whether a future loss will be incurred for any of its material outstanding legal and regulatory proceedings or to estimate a range of loss with respect to such proceeding, if any, and accordingly, no material amounts have been accrued in the Company’s financial statements for legal and regulatory proceedings. 
On November 12, 2021, the CFPB initiated a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the “District Court”) against FirstCash, Inc. and Cash America West, Inc., and later amended the complaint to include numerous Company subsidiaries as defendants. The CFPB’s lawsuit alleges violations of the MLA in connection with pawn transactions. The CFPB also alleges that these same alleged violations of the MLA constitute breaches of a 2013 CFPB consent order entered into by its predecessor company that, among other things, allegedly required the company and its successors to cease and desist from further MLA violations. The CFPB is seeking an injunction, redress for affected borrowers and a civil monetary penalty. After an initial period of pre-trial activity, the case was stayed on November 4, 2022, pending the Supreme Court review of the Fifth Circuit's decision in 
Community Financial v. CFPB
, where the Fifth Circuit held the CFPB’s funding mechanism was unconstitutional and its actions were void. The Supreme Court reversed that decision through an opinion issued on May 16, 2024. The stay of the CFPB case was lifted, and active litigation ensued. On November 7, 2024, the District Court denied the Company’s motion for partial summary judgement. The District Court has also ordered the parties to mediation. After an initial session, the mediation is currently postponed pending the leadership transition at the CFPB. Unless resolved by agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend the action.
Gold Forward Sales Contracts
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had contractual commitments to deliver a total of 
60,500
 gold ounces between the months of January 2025 and June 2026 at a weighted-average price of $
2,207
 per ounce. The ounces required to be delivered over this time period are less than the historical volume of scrap gold normally produced, and the Company expects to have the required gold ounces to meet the commitments as they come due.

NOTE 15 - EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
The Company has previously adopted equity and share-based compensation plans to attract and retain executive officers, directors and key employees. Under these plans, the Company may grant qualified and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to executive officers, directors and other key employees. At December 31, 2024, 
2,639,000
 shares were reserved for future grants to all employees and directors under the plans.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards
The Company has granted time-based and performance-based restricted stock units under the Company’s equity and share-based incentive compensation plans. The restricted stock units are settled in shares of common stock upon vesting and the Company typically issues treasury shares to satisfy vested restricted stock unit awards. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units is based on the Company’s closing stock price on the day of the grant (or subsequent award modification date, if applicable), and the grant date fair value of performance-based awards is based on the maximum amount of the award expected to be achieved. The amount attributable to award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting periods. 
The Company granted performance-based awards in 2024, 2023 and 2022 to certain executive officers. The performance period for these awards is the 
three-year
 cumulative period beginning on January 1 of the respective grant year. The performance goals for these grants include net income, adjusted for certain non-core and/or non-recurring items, AFF adjusted EBITDA and the Company’s total shareholder return relative to a peer group over the respective 
three-year
 cumulative period. The Company’s level of achievement of the performance goals at the end of each respective performance period will result in awards being earned between 
0
% and 
150
% of the target share award. 
The Company granted time-based awards in 2024, 2023 and 2022 to certain executive officers, directors and key employees of the Company which generally vest, subject to continued employment with the Company, over a 
one
, 
three
 or 
five-year
 period from the grant date.

NOTE 17 - 
SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION    
Segment Information
The Company considers its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to be a function shared by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company’s CODM reviews key financial information, such as revenue growth, pawn loan metrics, lease and finance receivable metrics and operating margins, to budget, allocate resources, and assess performance of each segment. Based on an analysis of the reports the CODM regularly reviews, the Company has determined there are 
three
 reportable segments as follows:
•
U.S. pawn
•
Latin America pawn 
•
Retail POS payment solutions (AFF)
Corporate expenses and income, which include administrative expenses, corporate depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, merger and acquisition expenses, gain on revaluation of contingent acquisition consideration, and other expenses (income), net, are presented on a consolidated basis and are not allocated between the U.S. pawn segment, Latin America pawn segment or retail POS payment solutions segment. Intersegment transactions relate to the Company offering AFF’s LTO payment solution in its U.S. pawn stores and are eliminated to arrive at consolidated totals.
The following tables present reportable segment information for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 as well as segment earning assets (in thousands):
