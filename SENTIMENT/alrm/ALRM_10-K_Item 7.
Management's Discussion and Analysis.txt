SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that reflect our current expectations regarding future events, our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in Part I, Item 1. "Business," Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors," and Part II, Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," but are also contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Forward-looking statements include any statement that does not directly relate to a current or historical fact. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the words "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "might," "objective," "ongoing," "plan," "predict," "project," "potential," "should," "will," "would," or the negative or plural of these words or other comparable terminology intended to identify statements about the future. The events described in these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Although we believe we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known to us and our expectations of the future, about which we cannot be certain. Forward-looking statements include statements about:
•
the anticipated impact of the global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions caused by significant worldwide events, including public health crises, and geopolitical upheaval (including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, and in Israel and surrounding areas), disruptions to global supply chains, fluctuations in interest rates, risk of recession and inflation (collectively, the Macroeconomic Conditions) on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including on our hardware sales and our Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue growth rate; our business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations; continued enhancements of our platform and offerings; and our future financial and business performance;
•
our ability to continue to increase revenue, maintain existing subscribers and sell new services to new and existing subscribers;
•
our ability to add new service provider partners, maintain existing service provider partner relationships and increase the productivity of our service provider partners;
•
the potential impact of trade policies and new or increased tariffs on our cost of hardware revenue and hardware revenue margins;
•
the effects of increased competition as well as innovations by new and existing competitors in our market;
•
our ability to adapt to technological change and effectively enhance, innovate and scale our solution;
•
our ability to effectively manage or sustain our growth;
•
our expected uses for the proceeds from the offering of our convertible senior notes;
•
potential acquisitions and integration of complementary business and technologies;
•
our ability to maintain, or strengthen awareness of, our brand;
•
perceived or actual security, integrity, reliability, quality or compatibility problems with our solutions, including related to security breaches in our systems, our subscribers’ systems, unscheduled downtime, or outages;
•
our future revenue, hiring plans, expenses, capital expenditures, capital requirements and stock performance;
•
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel and further expand our overall headcount;
•
our ability to develop relationships with service provider partners in order to expand internationally;
•
our ability to stay abreast of new or modified laws and regulations, including executive orders, that currently apply or become applicable to our business both in the United States and internationally;
•
our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property;
•
costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims; and
•
other risks detailed below in Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
You should refer to the “Summary of Risks Affecting Our Business” below and Item 1A. "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame or at all. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Annual Report.

Summary of Risks Affecting Our Business
The following summary highlights some of the principal risks you should consider with respect to our business and prospects. This summary is not complete and the risks included in the summary below are not the only risks we face. You should review and consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes a more complete discussion of the risks summarized below as well as a discussion of other risks related to our business and an investment in our common stock, as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline:
•
Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate and may be negatively affected by the Macroeconomic Conditions.
•
Our actual operating results may differ significantly from any guidance provided. If our actual results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.
•
We may not sustain our growth rate and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively.
•
We sell security and life safety solutions and if these solutions fail for any reason, we could be subject to liability and our business, reputation and results of operations could suffer.
•
Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including information relating to our service provider partners, subscribers and employees, could expose us to liability and adversely affect us.
•
The markets in which we participate are highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, broadband and security service providers and other managed service providers, are actively targeting the home and business automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and energy management markets. 
•
We rely on our service provider network to acquire additional subscribers, and the inability of our service providers to attract additional subscribers or retain their current subscribers could adversely affect our operating results.
•
We receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of service provider partners, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our major service provider partners would result in decreased revenue and profitability.
•
We have relatively limited visibility regarding the consumers that ultimately purchase our solutions, and we often rely on information from third-party service providers to help us manage our business. We operate in an evolving connected home market. If the connected property market does not grow as we expect or if a significant number of our target consumers choose to adopt point products that control discrete functions rather than our connected property solutions, we may not be able to achieve sustained growth or our business may decline.
•
We benefit from integration of our solutions with third-party platform providers. If developers of third-party platform providers choose not to partner with us, or are acquired by our competitors, our integrated solutions platform, business and results of operations may be harmed.
•
Our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions, and our potential inability to successfully consummate acquisitions or integrate newly-acquired technologies, assets or businesses may harm our financial results.
•
If we are unable to adapt to technological change, including maintaining compatibility with a wide range of devices, as well as changes in access to wireless networks through which we provide our wireless alarm, notification and intelligent automation services, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired and we may need to incur significant capital expenditures to update our technology.
•
We operate in a regulated industry and our business, operations and service provider partners are subject to various foreign, U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, including relating to consumer protection, licensing, Internet and data privacy, tax, tariff, sanctions, import/export restrictions or other trade barriers. Failure to comply with applicable executive orders, laws and regulations could harm our business and we may incur significant expenditures related to compliance efforts.
•
We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings where a negative outcome could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
•
Assertions by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses that could harm our business and results of operations.
•
We depend on our suppliers. The loss of any key supplier or the inability of a key supplier to deliver their products to us on time or at the contracted price would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
