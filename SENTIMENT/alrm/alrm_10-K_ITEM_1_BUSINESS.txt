Item 1. Business – Governance – Corporate Information. Information about the 2029 Notes and the related interest expense as well as changes in legal costs, which may affect the comparability of historical financial information, is disclosed in the Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2023 section below within Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
Geographic Areas
We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our international business, as 6% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 originated from customers located outside of North America. Our products are currently localized and available in over 50 countries outside of North America. On November 22, 2024, we acquired certain assets of Kapacity.io to help accelerate deployment of a cloud-based demand response platform internationally for our EnergyHub subsidiary.

Recent Developments
On January 30, 2025, we entered into a senior secured loan agreement with a service provider partner, under which a term loan was provided to the service provider partner in the original principal amount of $21.5 million, which loan is collateralized by the assets of the service provider partner. Quarterly principal payments begin in the second quarter of 2027. Interest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum equal to the overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a period of three months, plus 3.0%. For the first two years of the loan, monthly interest payments can be payable in kind at the election of the borrower. The maturity date of the loan is January 30, 2030.
On February 10, 2025, Alarm.com Incorporated acquired 81% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of CHeKT. CHeKT provides a remote video monitoring service for central station operators that is compatible with a variety of cameras. We believe the acquisition of CHeKT will help to expand our opportunity to provide remote video monitoring solutions in the commercial and residential markets.
In consideration for the purchase of 81% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of CHeKT, we paid $23.6 million in cash on February 10, 2025, after deducting $3.7 million related to agreed holdback provisions. We are currently evaluating the accounting treatment of this acquisition and are in the process of completing the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The global economy, credit markets and financial markets have and may continue to experience significant volatility as a result of the Macroeconomic Conditions. These Macroeconomic Conditions have and may continue to create tariffs, supply chain disruptions, inventory disruptions, and fluctuations in economic growth, including fluctuations in employment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer sentiment. It remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions. Prolonged uncertainty with respect to the Macroeconomic Conditions could cause further economic slowdown or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Other Business Metrics
We regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different from the way similar business metrics used by other companies are calculated and include the following (dollars in thousands):

SaaS and License Revenue
SaaS and license revenue is a GAAP measure that we use to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. We believe SaaS and license revenue is an indicator of the productivity of our existing service provider
 partner
s and their ability to activate and maintain subscribers using our intelligently connected property solutions, our ability to add new service provider partners reselling our solutions, the demand for our intelligently connected property solutions and the pace at which the market for these solutions is growing.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents our net income before interest expense, interest income, certain activity within other (expense) / income, net, provision for income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, legal costs and settlement fees incurred and received in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense; amortization of debt issuance costs for the January 20, 2021 issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026, or the 2026 Notes, included in interest expense; amortization of debt issuance costs for the May 31, 2024 issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029, or the 2029 Notes, included in interest expense; and stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units and other forms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.
We record interest expense primarily related to our 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes. We exclude interest expense in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we believe the exclusion of interest expense will provide for more meaningful information about our financial performance. We exclude interest income and certain activity within other (expense) / income, net including gains, losses or impairments on investments without readily determinable fair values and other assets, gains and losses from equity method investments, gains on settlement fees and losses on the early extinguishment of debt, when applicable, from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider it part of our ongoing results of operations. We exclude the impact related to our provision for income taxes from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider this tax adjustment to be part of our ongoing results of operations.
GAAP requires that operating expenses include the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which principally include acquired customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. We exclude amortization of intangibles from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider amortization expense when we evaluate our ongoing business operations, nor do we factor amortization expense into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or our measurement of the performance of those acquisitions. We believe the exclusion of amortization expense enables the comparison of our performance to other companies in our industry as other companies may be more or less acquisitive than we are, and therefore, amortization expense may vary significantly by company based on their acquisition history. Although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.
We record depreciation primarily for investments in property and equipment. We exclude depreciation in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider depreciation when we evaluate our ongoing business operations. 
We exclude stock-based compensation expense, which relates to restricted stock units and other forms of equity incentives primarily awarded to employees of Alarm.com, because they are non-cash charges that we do not consider when assessing the operating performance of our business. Additionally, the determination of stock-based compensation expense can be calculated using various methodologies and is dependent upon subjective assumptions and other factors that vary on a company-by-company basis. Therefore, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA improves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry.
Included in operating expenses are incremental costs directly related to business and asset acquisitions as well as changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, when applicable. We exclude acquisition-related expense from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we believe the exclusion of this expense allows us to better provide meaningful information about our operating performance, facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results, improves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry, and ultimately, we believe helps investors better understand the acquisition-related expense and the effects of the transaction on our results of operations.
We exclude non-ordinary course litigation expense because we do not consider legal costs and settlement fees incurred and received in litigation and litigation-related matters of non-ordinary course lawsuits and other disputes, particularly costs incurred in ongoing intellectual property litigation, to be indicative of our core operating performance. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses, including those expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.
61
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a key measure our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related adjustments and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see 
Non-GAAP Measures 
in this section for a discussion of the limitations of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
SaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate
Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is an operating metric. We measure our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on a trailing 12-month basis by dividing (a) the total SaaS and license revenue recognized during the trailing 12-month period from our subscribers on our Alarm.com platform who were subscribers on the first day of the period, by (b) total SaaS and license revenue we would have recognized during the period from those same subscribers assuming no terminations, or service level upgrades or downgrades. The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial properties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage and it is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform excluding subscribers of service providers that may use one of our other platforms as a substitute for the Alarm.com platform. 
O
ur service provider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate includes subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. We believe our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate allows us to measure our ability to retain and grow our SaaS and license revenue and serves as an indicator of the lifetime value of our subscriber base.
Components of Operating Results
Our fiscal year ends on December 31. The key elements of our operating results include:
Revenue
We derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners’ customers.
SaaS and License Revenue
. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary based upon the service plan and features utilized. 
We offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional features. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons enabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.
We also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. In addition, in certain markets, our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of subscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility’s or market’s control.
Software License Revenue
. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and services, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS. Software license revenue included in SaaS and license revenue is expected to continue to decline over time as we transition subscribers to our cloud-based hosted platform.
Hardware and Other Revenue. 
We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors, gunshot detection sensors and peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to 
62
our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the customer obtains control of the hardware. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns.
Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee. Additionally, our hardware and other revenue includes our revenue from the sale of licenses that provide our customers the right to use our indoor gunshot detection solution in exchange for license fees. Hardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee.
Our revenue, and in particular our hardware revenue, has in the past and may in the future be negatively affected by the Macroeconomic Conditions and their related impacts. It remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions.
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our network operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers and amounts paid to distributed energy resource providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which primarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the Software platform. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had 74 and 77 employees who manufacture hardware for our 
suite of IoT solutions, respectively. 
Our cost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling, freight shipments and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for production and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats and gunshot detection sensors, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Cost of hardware and other revenue also includes material costs and labor cost related to our employees who manufacture hardware for our 
suite of IoT solutions. 
Additionally, our cost of hardware and other revenue includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.
We record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We record the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when control of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.
Since 2019, the U.S. government has implemented and imposed significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Tariffs have subjected certain Alarm.com products manufactured overseas to additional import duties of up to 25%. The amount of the import tariff and the number of products subject to tariffs have changed numerous times based on action by the U.S. government. Less than one-third of the hardware products that we sell to our service provider partners are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. While the additional import duties resulted in an increase to our cost of hardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue margins. If tariffs are increased or are expanded to apply to more of our products, such actions may increase our cost of hardware revenue and reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future. We continue to monitor the changes in tariffs.
We currently expect our hardware revenue margins in 2025 to approximate the hardware revenue margins experienced during 2024.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and development and amortization and depreciation expenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense categories, excluding amortization and depreciation. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of restricted stock units and other forms of equity compensation, including equity compensation with performance conditions, in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient’s function (sales and marketing, general and administrative or research and development). We grew from 1,989 employees as of January 1, 2024 to 2,010 employees as of December 31, 2024
. W
e expect to continue to hire new employees to support the projected future growth of our business.
Sales and Marketing Expense.
 Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, travel, and commissions. Our 
63
sales and marketing teams engage in sales, account management, service provider partner support, advertising, promotion of our products and services and marketing.
The number of employees in sales and marketing functions increased from 565 as of January 1, 2024 to 572 as of December 31, 2024. We expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities to expand our business both domestically and internationally and we expect to increase our marketing expense in 2025 as compared to 2024. We intend to increase the size of our sales force and our service provider partner support team to provide additional support to our existing service provider partner base to drive their productivity in selling our solutions as well as to enroll new service provider partners in North America and in international markets.
General and Administrative Expense.
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting personnel, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Additional expenses included in this category are legal costs, including those that are incurred to defend and license our intellectual property, as well as non-personnel costs, such as travel-related expenses, rent, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services, and insurance expenses. Also included in general and administrative expenses are credit losses and acquisition-related expenses, which consist primarily of legal, accounting and professional service fees directly related to acquisitions and valuation gains or losses on acquisition-related contingent liabilities.
The number of employees in general and administrative functions increased from 229 as of January 1, 2024 to 237 as of December 31, 2024. Excluding intellectual property litigation and acquisition-related expense, we expect general and administrative costs to increase prospectively as our business grows. This includes cost increases related to human resources, accounting, finance, and legal personnel, additional external legal, audit fees and other expenses associated with regulations governing public companies. While somewhat unpredictable, we also expect to continue to incur costs related to litigation involving intellectual property. See the section of this Annual Report titled "Legal Proceedings" for additional information regarding litigation matters.
Research and Development Expense
. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product development and software and device engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Also included are non-personnel costs such as consulting and professional fees paid to third-party development resources.
The number of employees in research and development functions increased from 1,118 as of January 1, 2024 to 1,127 as of December 31, 2024. Our research and development efforts are focused on innovating new features and enhancing the functionality of our platforms and the solutions we offer to our service provider partners and subscribers. We will also continue to invest in efforts to extend our platforms to adjacent markets and internationally to maintain our leadership position in the development of intelligently connected property technology, and continued enhancement of our Partner Services Platform, a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade business management solutions for our service provider partners.
Amortization and Depreciation
. Amortization and depreciation consists of amortization of intangible assets originating from our acquisitions as well as our internally-developed capitalized software. Our depreciation expense is related to investments in property and equipment. Acquired intangible assets include developed technology, customer related intangibles, trademarks and trade names. We expect in the near term that amortization and depreciation may fluctuate based on our acquisition activity, development of our platforms and capitalized expenditures.
Interest Expense
We record interest expense associated with our 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and acquired debt. Interest expense in 2025 is expected to increase as compared to 2024 due to the issuance of the 2029 Notes.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, our notes receivable and our restricted cash. Interest income in 2025 will depend, in part, on our use of cash and fluctuations in interest rates.
Other (Expense) / Income, Net
Other (expense) / income, net primarily consists of non-operating and miscellaneous expense and income.
64
Provision for Income Taxes 
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed, the foreign derived intangible income deduction and tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of state taxes, foreign withholding taxes and other nondeductible expenses. We recognize stock-based compensation tax shortfalls and excess tax windfall benefits on a discrete basis during the quarter in which they occur, and we anticipate our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price as well as the vesting and exercises of various forms of equity compensation under our equity incentive plans each period, including restricted stock units and stock options.

The $58.1 million increase in total revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023 was the result of a $62.0 million, or 11%, increase in our SaaS and license revenue and a $3.9 million, or 1%, decrease in our hardware and other revenue. Our software license revenue included within SaaS and license revenue decreased $2.9 million to $20.3 million in 2024 as compared to $23.2 million during 2023, primarily due to the result of the continuing transition of customers from non-hosted software to our cloud based hosted platform. The SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment increased $49.8 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to growth in our subscriber base, including the revenue impact from subscribers we added in 2023, as well as an increase in our license revenue. The SaaS and license revenue for our Other segment increased $12.2 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in sales of our energy management and demand response solutions as well as our property management solution. The decrease in hardware and other revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily from the $3.3 million decrease in hardware and other revenue, net of intersegment eliminations, for the Alarm.com segment arising from a decrease in the volume of cameras sold. Hardware and other revenue, net of intersegment eliminations, in our Other segment decreased $0.6 million, in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to decreased sales related to our property management solution.

The $1.0 million increase in cost of revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023 was the result of a $3.6 million, or 4%, increase in cost of SaaS and license revenue and a $2.6 million, or 1%, decrease in cost of hardware and other revenue. Our cost of software license revenue included within cost of SaaS and license revenue remained relatively consistent at $0.6 million during 2024 and 2023. The cost of SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment increased $0.3 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to the growth in our subscriber base, which drove a corresponding increase in amounts paid to wireless network providers. The cost of SaaS and license revenue for the Other segment increased $3.3 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in sales of our energy management and demand response solutions, which drove a corresponding increase in amounts paid to distributed energy resource providers.The cost of hardware and other revenue for the Alarm.com segment decreased $2.1 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the number of hardware units shipped. The cost of hardware and other revenue for the Other segment decreased $0.5 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the number of hardware units shipped.
Cost of hardware and other revenue as a percentage of hardware and other revenue was 77% in 2024 and 2023. Cost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license revenue was 14% and 15% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023 is a reflection of the mix of sales and services during the periods. Cost of software license revenue as a percentage of software license revenue was 3% in 2024 and 2023.

The $11.0 million increase in sales and marketing expense in 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in personnel and related costs for our Alarm.com segment, attributable in part to increases in the headcount for our sales team to support our growth, and a $3.5 million increase in marketing expense for our Alarm.com segment. These increases in sales and marketing expense for our Alarm.com segment were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in our expenses for external consultants in 2024 as compared to 2023. Sales and marketing expense from our Other segment increased $4.8 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in personnel and related costs, attributable in part to increases in the headcount for our sales team. The overall number of employees in our sales and marketing teams increased from 565 as of December 31, 2023 to 572 as of December 31, 2024.

The $4.1 million decrease in general and administrative expense in 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $16.1 million decrease in legal costs for our Alarm.com segment related to intellectual property litigation. This decrease in general and administrative expense was partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in the provision for credit losses related to a loan we previously provided to an affiliated entity of one of our distribution partners, a $3.9 million increase in expenses related to a program to help our service providers resell our solutions and hardware to our subscribers, a $1.1 million increase in personnel and related costs, a $0.9 million increase in rent expense and a $0.7 million increase in recruiting costs and in 2024 as compared

Our SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment included software license revenue of $20.3 million, $23.2 million and $26.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was no software license revenue recorded for the Other segment during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Additions to property and equipment were $20.1 million, $8.9 million and $28.4 million for the Alarm.com segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additions to property and equipment were $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the Other segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, costs and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process in light of the continuing uncertainty arising from the Macroeconomic Conditions, actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Our most critical accounting estimates are summarized below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the following critical accounting estimates and our other significant accounting estimates.
Revenue
We derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners’ customers.
We have variable consideration primarily in the form of rebate incentives, which contain uncertainties and require us to make estimates of the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled. The significant inputs related to our estimates of variable consideration include the volume and amount of products and services sold historically and expected to be sold in the future, the availability and performance of our services and the historical and expected number of returns. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns. For each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our reserve against revenue for hardware returns was 1% of hardware and other revenue. We evaluate our hardware reserve on a quarterly basis or if there is an indication of significant changes in return experience. Historically, our returns of hardware have not significantly differed from our estimated reserve. 
While variable consideration assumptions are specific to each contract, we did not make any material changes to these assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2024. We do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to recognize revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our SaaS and license revenue as well as our hardware and other revenue.
Business Combinations
We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. This valuation contains uncertainties and requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of long-lived and intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing certain acquired customer relationship intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows and discount rates. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing acquired developed technology intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, obsolescence factors and discount rates. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing acquired trade name intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, royalty rates and discount rates.
We did not make any material changes to the underlying assumptions used as of the acquisition date to calculate the purchase price of the business combinations that occurred during 2023 and 2022. We do not expect any changes to the underlying assumptions used to calculate the purchase price of those business combinations as the purchase price allocation was finalized for these business combinations.
72
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets
Goodwill
We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on October 1 and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We perform either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis every year depending on the changes to our goodwill balance as well as changes in our business and the economy. Significant estimates and assumptions when we perform a quantitative assessment include estimates about future expected cash flows and discount rates. Qualitative factors we consider when we perform a qualitative analysis include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company specific events, changes in circumstances and market capitalization.
For our 2024 annual impairment review, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Alarm.com reporting unit, our only reporting unit with a goodwill balance. There were no triggering events that occurred between our qualitative annual impairment test performed as of October 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024. If triggering events arise in the future that require changes in the underlying assumptions used in our assessment of our goodwill, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our goodwill and potentially our other (expense) / income, net, if those significant changes result in an impairment.
Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets
Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. 
We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets are measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.
There were no indicators of impairment of our intangible assets with definite lives or long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. If triggering events arise in the future, depending on the significance of the underlying assumptions in the impairment analysis, they could have a material impact on our intangible assets and long-lived assets and potentially our other (expense) / income, net, if those significant changes result in an impairment.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 740, "
Income Taxes
," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. 
We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. 
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) with respect to those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 
We did not make any material changes to the underlying assumptions used to calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2024, and we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2024. However, if changes in these assumptions occur, and, should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on our deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as our provision for income taxes.
Stock-Based Compensation 
We compensate our executive officers, board of directors and employees with stock-based compensation plans under our 2015 Plan. We record stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units based on 
73
management’s determination of the probable outcome of the performance conditions, which requires considerable judgment. We estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which contains uncertainties and requires us to estimate the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The expected term for options granted is estimated using our historical experience, including information related to options we have granted.

We define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 are available for working capital purposes. Our investment policy defines allowable investments and establishes guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve capital, maintain liquidity and limit the amount of credit risk exposure. As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily held in money market accounts.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.22 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. To date, we have principally financed our operations through cash generated by operating activities and through private and public equity and debt financings. We mitigate the risk of loss for our cash and cash equivalents by depositing funds with a number of reputable financial institutions and monitoring both the risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.
Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 amended Internal Revenue Code Section 174, or Section 174, to eliminate the option to immediately deduct research and development expenditures in the year incurred, requiring these expenditures to be capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic expenditures and over 15 years for foreign expenditures. We calculated the 2022 federal and state cash tax increase from Section 174 to be $38.1 million, which was paid in early 2023, the 2023 federal and state cash tax increase from Section 174 to be $43.5 million, which we paid in April 2024, and we have estimated the 2024 federal and state cash tax increase from Section 174 to be approximately $33.5 million, which we expect to pay in April 2025. The Section 174 impact on 2025 cash flows from operating activities will depend on, among other factors, our 2025 operating results and the level of 2025 research and development activity. Based on information currently available to us, we estimate the 2025 Section 174 federal and state cash tax payable for our 2025 taxable income to be in the range of $25.0 million to $30.0 million if the requirement to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures is not deferred, modified or repealed. This estimate is based on the limited information that is currently available and is subject to change. While the largest impact has been to cash flow from operating activities, the impact for domestic research and development expenditures would continue over the five-year amortization period beginning in 2022, but has decreased over that period and is expected to be immaterial beginning in year six. There is discussion of prospectively repealing the requirement to capitalize domestic research and development costs, but there is no assurance such legislation will be enacted.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our future cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the next 12 months, we expect our capital expenditure requirements to be between $12.0 million and $15.0 million, primarily related to purchases of computer software and equipment as well as the continued build out of our leased and owned office space. As of December 31, 2024, maturities of lease liabilities for our various leases are as follows: $13.1 million in 2025, $11.8 million in 2026, $12.1 million in 2027, $11.5 million in 2028, $11.1 million in 2029 and $43.5 million in 2030 and thereafter.

On January 30, 2025, we entered into a senior secured loan agreement with a service provider partner, under which a term loan was provided to the service provider partner in the original principal amount of $21.5 million, which loan is collateralized by the assets of the service provider partner. Quarterly principal payments begin in the second quarter of 2027. Interest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum equal to the overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a period of three months, plus 3.0%. For the first two years of the loan, monthly interest payments can be payable in kind at the election of the borrower. The maturity date of the loan is January 30, 2030.
In consideration for the purchase of 81% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of CHeKT, we paid $23.6 million in cash on February 10, 2025, after deducting $3.7 million related to agreed holdback provisions. We are currently evaluating the accounting treatment of this acquisition and are in the process of completing the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Our future working capital, capital expenditure and cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions on the economy and our operations, the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in human resources and capital equipment, future acquisitions and investments, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new solutions and platform and solution enhancements. As the impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. To the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to borrow additional funds or raise funds from public or private equity or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would likely have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our current stockholders.
The following discussion summarizes our current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows:

See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for details on the components of other long-term liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a liability for long-term accrued taxes and interest payable of $9.3 million. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, we have excluded the liability related to these uncertain tax positions from the table above. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.

Represents amounts due under multi-year, non-cancelable contracts with third-party vendors, as well as other commitments.
The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.
Convertible Senior Notes - 2026
On January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the 2026 Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the 2026 Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs.
75
We may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, at our option, on or after January 20, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes.
The 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2026 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the 2026 Indenture.
On or after August 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2026 Notes, holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2026 Notes with cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Notes is 6.7939 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $147.19 per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2026 Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of the 2026 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2026 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2026 Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the Indenture), as the case may be. 
If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the 2026 Indenture), subject to certain exceptions and except as described in the 2026 Indenture, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The 2026 Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving us after which the 2026 Notes become automatically due and payable.
We used some of the proceeds to repay the $110.0 million outstanding principal balance under our credit facility and also used some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to our credit facility, which was terminated effective January 20, 2021. We are using the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies.
Convertible Senior Notes - 2029 Notes
On May 31, 2024, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2029 Notes. The terms of the 2029 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the 2029 Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that bear interest at a rate of 2.25% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024, and the principal amount of the 2029 Notes will not accrete. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. 
We may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the 2029 Notes (subject to the partial redemption limitation described below), at our option, on or after June 7, 2027, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the 2029 Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending 
76
on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If we redeem less than all the 2029 Notes, at least $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2029 Notes.
The 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 1, 2029, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the 2029 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2029 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2029 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2029 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the 2029 Indenture.
On or after January 1, 2029, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2029 Notes, holders of the 2029 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2029 Notes with cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes is 11.4571 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $87.28 per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2029 Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2029 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of some or all of the 2029 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2029 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2029 Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2029 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the 2029 Indenture), as the case may be. 
If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Indenture), subject to certain exceptions and except as described in the 2029 Indenture, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The 2029 Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2029 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving us after which the 2029 Notes become automatically due and payable.
We used $63.1 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below and used $75.0 million to repurchase 1,117,068 shares of our common stock concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, which was separately authorized by our board of directors. We are using the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies, other repurchases of our common stock, repurchases of our 2026 Notes and for working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.
Capped Call – 2029 Notes
In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers and certain other financial institutions, at a cost of $63.1 million. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2029 Notes, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2029 Notes. The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially $134.28 per share of our common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 28, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The exercise price is $87.28 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments that mirror corresponding adjustments for the 2029 Notes.
Sources of Liquidity 
On January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and received proceeds of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. The 2026 Notes are discussed in more detail above under “Convertible Senior Notes - 2026.”
77
On May 31, 2024, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and received proceeds of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. The 2029 Notes are discussed in more detail above under "Convertible Senior Notes - 2029 Notes."
Dividends
We did not declare or pay dividends during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. We cannot provide any assurance that we will declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, the requirements of current or then-existing debt instruments and other factors the board of directors deems relevant.
Stock Repurchase Programs
On February 15, 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, effective February 23, 2023, under which we were authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending February 23, 2025. 
On May 24, 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the cancellation of the balance under the stock repurchase program ending February 23, 2025, and also authorized a stock repurchase program, effective May 31, 2024, under which we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending May 31, 2026. The full repurchase balance for this program of $100.0 million was available as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 1,117,068 shares of our common stock for $75.0 million concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, which was separately authorized by our board of directors. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 487,918 and 1,385,592 shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs that were subsequently canceled effective May 31, 2024 and February 15, 2023, for $27.3 million and $78.8 million, respectively, which includes applicable commissions and fees.
As of January 1, 2023, we are subject to a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. When applicable, the excise tax will be included as part of the cost basis of shares acquired and is presented within stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
Shares Withheld
As permitted under the terms of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan, in 2021 the Compensation Committee authorized the withholding of shares of common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards issued to employees to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements. These withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. We paid $3.4 million and $2.6 million of tax withholdings related to vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock units were paid during the year ended December 31, 2022. We also utilized the sell-to-cover method in which shares of our restricted stock unit awards were sold into the market on behalf of the employee upon vesting to cover tax withholding liabilities. We may utilize either the withholding method or sell-to-cover method in the future.

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation.
For 2024, cash flows from operating activities were $206.4 million, compared to $136.0 million for 2023. This $70.4 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $42.2 million increase in net income, a $19.7 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities and a $8.5 million increase in non-cash and other reconciling items. 
The $19.7 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to differences in the timing of disbursements and the collection of receipts, partially offset by a $12.4 million change in inventory purchased in 2024 as compared to 2023. The $8.5 million increase in non-cash and other reconciling items was primarily due to a $13.2 million change in deferred income taxes, which was primarily driven by the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures under Section 174, as well as a $4.0 million increase in the provision for credit losses on notes receivable related to a loan we provided to an affiliated entity of one of our distribution partners in 2024. These increases in non-cash and other reconciling items were partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation and a $2.3 million decrease in amortization and depreciation expense in 2024 as compared to 2023 as well as a $1.4 million inventory write-down in 2023 that did not occur in 2024. 
For 2023, cash flows from operating activities were $136.0 million, compared to $56.9 million for 2022. This $79.1 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $49.3 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities, a $24.7 million increase in net income and a $5.1 million increase in non-cash and other reconciling items. The $49.3 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $61.3 million change in inventory resulting from a decrease in purchased inventory following 2022 purchase activity to reduce risks and uncertainties in our supply chain as well as differences in the timing of disbursements and the collection of receipts in 2023 as compared to 2022. The $5.1 million increase in non-cash and other reconciling items was primarily due to a $7.3 million change in deferred income taxes, which was primarily driven by the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures under Section 174, as well as a $1.4 million inventory write-down during 2023, which did not occur in 2022. These increases in non-cash and other reconciling items were partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation in 2023 as compared to 2022.
Investing Activities
Our investing activities typically include acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments in unconsolidated entities, notes receivable issued to companies with offerings complementary to ours and proceeds from the repayment of those notes receivable. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business use, including leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount, computer equipment used internally and expansion of our network operations centers.
For 2024, cash flows used in investing activities was $24.7 million, compared to $26.0 million in 2023. The $1.3 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the $9.7 million paid to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EBS Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, or EBS, net of cash acquired, and the $5.9 million paid to purchase certain assets from Vintra, Inc., or Vintra, including direct transaction costs, in 2023 which did not occur in 2024. These decreases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by a $9.3 million increase in purchases of investments in unconsolidated entities, a $2.6 million increase in purchases of equipment, $1.4 million paid to purchase certain assets of Kapacity.io in 2024 which did not occur in 2023 as well as a $0.9 million increase in payments related to capitalized software development costs in 2024 as compared to 2023.
For 2023, cash flows used in investing activities was $26.0 million, compared to $68.3 million in 2022. The $42.3 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the $31.9 million paid to purchase 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Noonlight and the $21.8 million paid for developable land during 2022, which did not occur during 2023. These decreases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by $9.7 million paid to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EBS, net of cash acquired, and the $5.9 million paid to purchase certain assets from Vintra, including direct transaction costs, in 2023, which did not occur in 2022.
Financing Activities
Cash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from the 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities typically includes repurchases of common stock, repayments of debt, payments of debt issuance costs and purchases of capped calls related to the 2029 Notes.
79
For 2024, cash flows from financing activities was $346.4 million, compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $31.9 million in 2023. The $378.3 million increase in cash flows from in financing activities was primarily due to $485.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, net of issuances costs paid in 2024, which did not occur in 2023. These increases in cash flows from financing activities were partially offset by a $47.7 million increase in purchases of shares of our common stock and $63.1 million purchases of capped calls related to the 2029 Notes in 2024, which did not occur in 2023.
For 2023, cash flows used in financing activities was $31.9 million, compared to $76.3 million in 2022. The $44.4 million decrease in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to the $51.5 million decrease in purchases of shares of our common stock in 2023 as compared to 2022, partially offset by $3.0 million in debt payments related to the debt assumed in the acquisition of EBS as well as $2.6 million of tax withholdings paid related to vesting of restricted stock units in 2023, which did not occur in 2022.
Non-GAAP Measures
We define non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as our net income before interest expense, interest income, certain activity within other (expense) / income, net, provision for income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, legal costs and settlement fees incurred and received in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs for the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes included in interest expense, stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units and other forms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We have included non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a performance measure under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.
Our use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although amortization and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being amortized and depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.
80
Because of these and other limitations, you should consider non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of inflation and foreign exchange rates.
The uncertainty that exists with respect to the economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions continues to create significant volatility in the financial markets subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2024.
Market Risk
On January 20, 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes. On May 31, 2024, we issued the 2029 Notes. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized issuance costs. However, the fair values of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes fluctuate when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Because substantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we do not believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses becomes denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may not be able to effectively manage this risk, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by translation and by transactional foreign currency conversions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Alarm.com Holdings, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible instruments in 2022.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
83
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue recognition
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on its integrated Alarm.com platform, the sales of licenses and services on its non-hosted software platform, and the sale of hardware products. Cloud-based SaaS services are billed monthly in advance and revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as the performance obligation is satisfied. Licenses on non-hosted services are billed monthly and revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as the services are performed. Hardware revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control. The Company’s total revenue was $939.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the accuracy and occurrence of revenue transactions.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the accuracy and occurrence of revenue transactions. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating, on a test basis, the accuracy and occurrence of transactions recognized as revenue by obtaining and inspecting, where applicable, invoices, customer purchase orders, dealer and license agreements, shipping documents and cash receipts from customers.

ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Note 1. 
Organization
Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as Alarm.com, the Company, or we) is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. 
Our cloud-based platform offers an expansive suite of Internet of Things, or IoT, solutions addressing global 
opportunities in the residential, multi-family, small business and enterprise commercial markets. Alarm.com’s solution suite includes security, video and video analytics, energy management, access control, electric utility grid management, indoor gunshot detection, water management, health and wellness, personal safety and data-rich emergency response.

Our solutions are delivered through an established network of trusted service provider partners, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We derive revenue from the sale of our cloud-based Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, services, license fees, software, hardware, activation fees and other revenue. Our fiscal year ends on December 31.
Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Equity investments over which we are able to exercise significant influence but do not control the investee are accounted for using the equity method.
We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity, or VIE. Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide equity investor voting rights that give them power to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. In VIEs, a controlling financial interest is attained through means other than voting rights and the entities lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting entity.
We have unconsolidated equity investments in third-party businesses. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, we measure investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. We make a separate election to use the measurement alternative for each eligible investment, and reassess whether an investment qualifies for the alternative at each reporting period. Adjustments resulting from impairment, fair value or observable price changes are recorded in other (expense) / income, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates, assumptions and judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. However, our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience and may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. The global economy, credit markets and financial markets have and may continue to experience significant volatility as a result of significant worldwide events, including public health crises, and geopolitical upheaval (including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, and in Israel and surrounding areas), disruptions to global supply chains, fluctuations in interest rates, risk of recession and inflation (collectively, the Macroeconomic Conditions). Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process and in light of the continuing uncertainty arising from the Macroeconomic Conditions, actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material. Estimates are used when accounting for revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses, allowance for hardware returns, estimates of obsolete inventory, long-term incentive compensation, the lease term and incremental borrowing rates for leases, stock-based compensation, income taxes, legal reserves, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have invested $
1.21
 billion and $
679.7
 million in cash equivalents in the form of money market funds with a number of financial institutions, respectively. We consider these money market funds to be Level 1 financial instruments (see Note 10).
92
ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are principally derived from sales to customers located in the United States and Canada.
 Revenue in countries outside of North America accounted for 
6
%, 
4
% and 
4
% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accounts receivable balances related to service providers partners outside of North America were 
8
% and 
7
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Our accounts receivable are stated at estimated realizable value.
Restricted Cash
We consider all cash reserved for a specific use and not available for immediate or general business use to be restricted cash.
 As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of $
8.4
 million of restricted cash, of which $
2.2
 million was included in other current assets and $
6.2
 million was included in other assets within our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of $
4.1
 million of restricted cash, of which less than $
0.1
 million was included in other current assets and $
4.1
 million was included in other assets within our consolidated balance sheets.
Notes Receivable
Notes receivable are presented net of an allowance for uncollectibility, if any. We accrue interest on notes receivable based on the contractual terms of the note. Outstanding notes receivable that are aged 30 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. Notes receivable are evaluated for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Factors considered in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting payments when due.
 See Note 9 for further details on loans provided to distribution partners, technology partners and service provider partners.
Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the accounts receivable and notes receivable amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected. We estimate the allowance balance by applying the loss-rate method using relevant available information from internal and external sources, including historical write-off activity, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates. We use projected economic conditions over a period no more than twelve months based on data from external sources. For periods beyond the twelve-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical loss information immediately.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. When assessing whether to measure certain financial assets on a pooled basis, we considered various risk characteristics, including the financial asset type, size and the historical or expected credit loss pattern. These risk characteristics are relevant to accounts receivable and notes receivable. 
Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the financial assets and we adjust the term for expected prepayments when appropriate. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we recorded credit loss expense of $
4.7
 million, $
1.0
 million and $
0.8
 million in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations, respectively. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications because extension and renewal options are unconditionally cancelable by us. Write-offs of the amortized cost basis are recorded to the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent recoveries of previously written off balances are recorded as a reduction to credit loss expense.
Credit Losses - Accounts Receivable
We identified the following 
two
 portfolio segments for our accounts receivable: (i) outstanding accounts receivable balances within Alarm.com and certain subsidiaries and (ii) outstanding accounts receivable balances within all other subsidiaries. There were no changes to our portfolio segments for our accounts receivable during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and no changes to our policies or practices that influenced our estimate of expected credit losses for accounts receivable. Additionally, there were no significant changes in the amount of accounts receivable write-offs during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to historical periods.
Credit Losses - Notes Receivable
We identified 
one
 portfolio segment, loan receivables, for our notes receivable. We previously disclosed a hardware financing receivable portfolio segment; however, there has been no activity within that portfolio segment since 2022. There were no changes to our policies or practices involving the issuance of notes receivable, customer acquisitions or any other factors that influenced our estimate of expected credit losses. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we wrote off $
4.0
 million related to a note receivable that originated in 2017 with an affiliate entity of one of our distribution partners, or the Affiliate, and reversed the 
93
ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
previously allowance for credit losses recorded earlier in 2024. There were no purchases or sales of financial assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. There were 
no
 hardware financing receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
We do not accrue interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are 90 days or greater past due based on their contractual payment terms. Notes receivable that are 90 days or greater past due are placed on nonaccrual status. Notes receivable may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management’s opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a note receivable has been placed on nonaccrual status, interest will be recognized when cash is received. A note receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer’s delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured. We have elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables
.
 We write-off any accrued interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are 90 days or greater past due based on their contractual payment terms by reversing interest income. The accrued interest receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
0.2
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively, and is reflected in other current assets and other assets within our consolidated balance sheets and excluded from the amortized cost basis of the notes receivable
.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a reduction to our interest income of $
0.5
 million related to the reversal of payable in kind interest associated with a subordinated credit agreement with the Affiliate. We did 
not
 write-off any accrued interest receivable during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Inventory
Our inventory, which is comprised of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, includes materials used to produce our wireless communications network enabled radios, video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats, gunshot detection sensors, home automation system parts and peripherals, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and is charged to cost of sales primarily on a first in, first out, or FIFO, basis when the inventory is shipped from our manufacturer and received by our service provider partners. We periodically evaluate our inventory quantities for obsolescence based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technology and record an obsolescence write-off when necessary.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. As part of the lease determination process, we assess several factors, including, but not limited to, whether we have the right to control and direct the use of the asset and whether the other party has a substantive substitution right. If we enter into leases that contain multiple components, we identify separate lease components based on whether or not the right to use the underlying assets is distinct and either highly dependent or highly interrelated with other rights in the contract. We also evaluate whether there are any non-lease components in the arrangement. For certain classes of underlying assets, such as data centers, we have elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components. For all other classes of underlying assets, if separate lease and non-lease components are identified, we allocate the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components using the relative stand-alone selling price method at the lease inception.
Some of our leases include options to renew at our sole discretion. We also have several leases that provide us an option to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term. These renewal and termination options are included in the lease term at the commencement date when we are reasonably certain the options will be exercised. When assessing the likelihood of electing these options, we consider the length of the renewal period, market conditions, our expansion plans, the existence of a termination penalty, as well as other factors. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or variable lease payments.
Right-of-use, or ROU, assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the term of the lease and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments throughout the term of the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized as of the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of contractual lease payments due over the term of the lease. We use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments, as our leases do not state the rate implicit in the lease. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined on a collateralized basis at the commencement date of the lease.
ROU assets and lease liabilities resulting from operating leases are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We did 
no
t have any finance leases or subleases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Office and equipment lease expense is recorded in general and administrative expense and data center lease expense recorded in cost of SaaS and license revenue as well as research and development expense. Some of our leases include tenant improvement allowances, which are recorded when we are reasonably certain to utilize the allowance and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or the asset lives. Leases with an initial lease term of twelve months or less are considered short-term leases. Short-term leases are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Expenses associated with short-term leases are recognized on a

ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
straight-line basis over the term of the lease and are recorded in general and administrative expense.
 Short-term lease costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Convertible Senior Notes
On January 20, 2021, we issued $
500.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
0
% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. On May 31, 2024, we issued $
500.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
2.25
% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2029 Notes. Prior to the January 1, 2022 adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2020-06, "
Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity
," we separated the 2026 Notes into liability and equity components. In accounting for the issuance of our convertible senior notes, the carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that did not have an associated convertible feature, using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2026 Notes as a whole. This difference between the aggregate principal amount and the liability component represented a debt discount that was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were netted with the liability component and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2026 Notes. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component of the notes in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The equity component was not remeasured as long as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification.
We adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective adoption method, which required us to record the initial effect of this guidance as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2022. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, we recombined the liability and equity components of the 2026 Notes assuming that the instrument was accounted for as only a liability from inception to the date of adoption. We also recombined the liability and equity components of the debt issuance costs. We also removed the temporary difference between the book and tax treatment of the debt discount and adjusted the temporary difference between the book and tax treatment of the debt issuance costs of the 2026 Notes. 
The issuance costs are presented as a deduction from the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes.
Capped Call Transactions
On May 31, 2024, we issued the 2029 Notes. In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers and certain other financial institutions, at a cost of $
63.1
 million. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2029 Notes, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2029 Notes. As the capped call options are both legally detachable and separately exercisable from the 2029 Notes, we account for the capped call options separately from the 2029 Notes. The capped call options are indexed to our own common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity. As such, the premiums paid for the capped call options were included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The capped call transactions will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.
We elected to integrate the capped call options with the 2029 Notes for federal income tax purposes pursuant to applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. Accordingly, the $
63.1
 million cost of the purchased capped calls will be deductible for income tax purposes. The original issue discount is accreted over the term of the 2029 Notes.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive (loss) / income. Other comprehensive (loss) / income refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholders' equity and excluded from net income. Our other comprehensive (loss) / income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments.
95
ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Foreign Currency
For foreign operations where substantially all monetary transactions are in the local currency, we use the local currency as the functional currency. For these foreign operations, assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and revenue and expense items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the periods being reported. The effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations into our reporting currency are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurements that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in our results of operations.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Our redeemable noncontrolling interests relate to our 
86
% equity ownership interest in PC Open Incorporated, a Washington corporation, doing business as OpenEye and our 
85
% equity ownership interest in Noonlight, Inc., or Noonlight, a Delaware corporation (see Note 7). The OpenEye and Noonlight stockholder agreements contain a put option that gives the minority stockholders the right to sell their shares to us based on the fair value of the shares and also contain a call option that gives us the right to purchase the remaining shares from the minority stockholders based on the fair value of the shares. The next put and call options related to OpenEye can each be exercised beginning in the first quarter of 2025. The put and call options related to Noonlight can each be exercised beginning in the first quarter of 2026. These redeemable noncontrolling interests are considered temporary equity and we report them between liabilities and stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the net income or loss attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interests is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and the accretion of the redemption values is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. We account for purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interest as a component of stockholders' equity when control is maintained. We recognize the difference between the consideration paid for the acquired redeemable noncontrolling interest and the fair value of the acquired redeemable noncontrolling interest as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
 The aggregate redemption values of the of the noncontrolling interest was $
44.7
 million and $
36.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Internal-Use Software
We capitalize the costs directly related to the development of internal-use software for our platforms during the application development stage of the projects. Such costs primarily include payroll and payroll-related costs for engineers and product development employees directly associated with the development project. Our internal-use software is reported at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization begins once the project is ready for its intended use, which is usually when the code goes into production in weekly software builds on our platforms. We amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is typically a 
three
 to 
five-year
 period. We update our software for our SaaS multi-tenant platforms on a weekly basis utilizing continuous agile development methods, which primarily consists of bug-fixes and user interface changes. We evaluate whether a project should be capitalized if it adds significant functionality to our platforms. Maintenance activities or minor upgrades are expensed in the period performed.
External Software
Costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product that will be marketed and sold are charged to expense when incurred until technological feasibility is established. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, completion of a working model. After technological feasibility is established, certain payroll and payroll-related costs are capitalized for engineers and product development employees directly associated with the development project. Cost capitalization ceases when the product is available for general release. Our non-hosted software is typically developed in an agile environment with frequent revisions to product release features and functions. Agile development results in a short duration between completion of the detailed program design and beta release.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our capitalized software development costs for internal-use software and external software included in the consolidated balance sheets were $
2.4
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively.

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from 
three
 primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and services on our non-hosted software platform, or Software platform, and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our solutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners’ customers. Our subscribers consist of all of the properties maintained by those residential and commercial property owners to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. We also sell our hardware to distributors who resell the hardware to service provider partners. We enter into contracts with our service provider partners that establish pricing for access to our platform solutions and for the sale of hardware. These service provider c
ontracts typically have an initial term o
f 
one year
, with subsequent renewal terms of 
one year
. Our service provider partners have indicated that they typically have 
three
 to 
five-year
 service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions.
Our hardware sales includes connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats, image sensors, gunshot detection sensors, gateway modules and peripherals. Our service provider partners may purchase our hardware in anticipation of installing the hardware in a residential or commercial property when they create a new subscriber account, or for use in existing subscriber properties. The purchase of hardware occurs in a transaction that is separate and typically in advance of the purchase of our platform services. The performance obligation is primarily satisfied when the hardware is received by our service provider partner or distributor. Service provider partners transact with us to purchase our platform solutions and resell our solutions to a new subscriber, or to upgrade or downgrade the solutions of an existing subscriber, at which time the subscriber’s access to our platform solutions is enabled and the delivery of the services commences. Our performance obligation related to providing our platform solutions is satisfied on a daily basis as the subscriber uses the platform services. The purchase of platform solutions and the purchase of hardware are separate transactions as revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers.
SaaS and license revenue associated with our contracts is recognized at an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. Additionally, the consideration received from hardware sales corresponds directly with the stand-alone selling price of the hardware. As a result, we have elected to use the practical expedient related to the amount of transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations and therefore, we have not disclosed the total remaining revenue expected to be recognized on all contracts or the expected period over which the remaining revenue would be recognized.
To determine the transaction price, we analyze all of the performance obligations included in the contract. We consider the terms of the contract and our customary business practices, which typically do not include financing components or non-cash consideration. We have variable consideration primarily in the form of rebate incentives. The significant inputs related to our estimates of variable consideration include the volume and amount of products and services sold historically and expected to be sold in the future, the availability and performance of our services and the historical and expected number of returns. Depending on the type of variable consideration and its predictability, we may apply an "expected value" approach or a "most likely amount" approach. We estimate the variable consideration at the onset of a contract and include the variable consideration within the transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of the variable consideration would not occur in the future. When determining whether the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price should be constrained, we look at the history of hardware purchased and subscribers added by our service provider partners to estimate the likelihood of those service provider partners obtaining the rebates. At times, our contracts include consideration payable to a customer in the form of fixed discounts or rebates. We record the consideration payable to a customer as a reduction to the transaction price resulting in a reduction to revenue over the service period.
If we enter into contracts that contain multiple promised services, we evaluate which of the promised services represent separate performance obligations based on whether or not the promised services are distinct and whether or not the services are separable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are met, then we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using the relative stand-alone selling price method at contract inception. 
In determining the relative estimated selling prices, we consider market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. Any discount within the contract is allocated proportionately to all of the separate performance obligations in the contract unless the terms of discount relate specifically to the entity’s efforts to satisfy some but not all of the performance obligations. 
For our standard service provider agreements, we have used a portfolio approach for purposes of revenue recognition, as each agreement has similar characteristics and we do not expect the effects of applying this approach would have a material impact on our financial statements as compared to assessing each agreement individually.

SaaS and License Revenue
We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider partners on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary based upon the service plan and features utilized.
Under the terms of our contractual arrangements with our service provider partners, we bill a monthly fee to our service provider partners in advance of the month of service, with the exception of the initial partial month of service, which is paid in arrears. Due to the limited period of time between receipt of payment and delivery of service, we have not accounted for these advance payments as significant financing components. We typically transfer the promised SaaS services to our customers over time, which is evidenced by the fact that the customers receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance of the services as such services are rendered. As a result, we recognize revenue from SaaS services on a monthly basis as we satisfy our performance obligations over the period of service. We have demonstrated that we can sell our SaaS offering on a stand-alone basis, as it can be sold separately from hardware and activation services. Our service provider partners typically incur and pay the same monthly fee per subscriber account for the entire period a subscriber account is active.
We offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional features. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons enabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.
We also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. We bill a monthly fee to third parties based on the number of customers that were active during the prior month. We apply the usage-based royalty exception to recognize license revenue because the sole or predominant item to which the royalty relates is the license of intellectual property. Under the usage-based royalty exception, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the period of service. In addition, in certain markets, our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of subscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility’s or market’s control.
Software License Revenue
Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a per subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and services, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS. Software sales that include multiple elements are typically allocated to the various elements using the relative stand-alone selling price method. We apply the usage-based royalty exception to recognize license revenue associated with software hosted by our customers because the predominant item to which the royalty relates is the license of intellectual property. Under the usage-based royalty exception, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the period during which the services are expected to be performed. Under the terms of our contractual arrangements with our service provider partners, we are entitled to payment of a monthly fee that is billed per subscriber for the month of service. Our software license revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
20.3
 million, $
23.2
 million and $
26.8
 million, respectively.
Hardware and Other Revenue
We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats and cellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors, gunshot detection sensors and peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the customer obtains control of the hardware. As a result, we recognize hardware and other revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations, which primarily occurs when the hardware is received by our service provider partner or distributor, net of a reserve for estimated returns. There are a few contracts in which we provide shipping and handling services to the customer after control of the hardware transfers to the customer. In these instances, we have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as activities performed to fulfill the promise to transfer hardware to the customer and not as a separate promised service.
Amounts due from the sale of hardware are payable in accordance with the terms of our agreements with our service provider partners or distributors, and are not contingent on resale to end-users, or to service provider partners in the case of sales of hardware to distributors. Payment for our hardware is typically due within 30 days from shipment. Our distributors sell directly to our service provider partners under terms between the two parties.
When determining the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to for the sale of our hardware, we estimate the variable consideration associated with customer returns. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns. For each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our reserve against revenue for hardware

returns was 
1
% of hardware and other revenue. We evaluate our hardware reserve on a quarterly basis or if there is an indication of significant changes in return experience. Hist
orically, our returns of hardware have not significantly differed from our estimated reserve. Additionally, we provide warranties related to the intended functionality of the products and services provided and those warranties typically allow for the return of hardware up to

one year
 past the date of sale. We determined that these warranties are not separate performance obligations as they cannot be purchased separately and do not provide a service in addition to an assurance the hardware will function as expected.
Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of licenses that provide our customers the right to use our indoor gunshot detection solution in exchange for license fees. Our perpetual licenses and licenses to our indoor gunshot detection solution provide a right to use intellectual property that is functional in nature and has significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for licenses of functional intellectual property, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs once the software has been made available to the customer.
Hardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our platforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. Our service provider partners use services on our platforms, such as support tools and applications, to assist in the installation of our solutions in subscriber properties. This installation marks the beginning of the service period on our platforms and, on occasion, we earn activation revenue for fees charged for this service. The activation fee is non-refundable, separately negotiated and specified in our contractual arrangements with our service provider partners and is charged to the service provider partner for each subscriber activated on our platforms. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the expected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an activation fee. Activation fees are not offered on a stand-alone basis separate from our SaaS offering and are billed and received at the beginning of the arrangement. We record activation fees initially as deferred revenue and we recognize these fees ratably over the expected term of the subscribers’ account which we estimate is 
10
 years based on our annual attrition rate. The portion of these activation fees included in current and long-term deferred revenue as of our balance sheet date represents the amounts that will be recognized ratably as revenue over the following 
twelve months
, or longer as appropriate, until the 
10-year
 expected term is complete. The balance of deferred revenue for activation fees was $
4.3
 million and $
4.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which combines current and long-term balances.
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our network operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers and amounts paid to distributed energy resource providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which primarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the Software platform. Our cost of software license revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
0.6
 million, $
0.6
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively. Our cost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling, freight shipments and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for production and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats and gunshot detection sensors, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Cost of hardware and other revenue also includes material costs and labor cost related to our employees who manufacture hardware for our suite of IoT solutions. Additionally, our cost of hardware and other revenue includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.
We record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We record the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when control of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses.
Contract Asset and Contract Liability Balances
At contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each distinct promise to transfer a good or service, or bundle of goods or services. To identify the performance obligations, we consider all of the goods or services promised in the contract, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices. We record a contract asset when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service. Contract assets can be conditional or unconditional depending on whether another performance obligation must be satisfied before payment can be received. We receive payments from our service provider partners based on the billing schedule established in our contracts. All of the accounts receivable presented in the consolidated balance sheets represent unconditional rights to consideration. We do not have any assets from contracts containing conditional rights and we do not have any assets from satisfied performance obligations that have not been invoiced.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
We recognize an asset related to the costs incurred to obtain a contract only if we expect to recover those costs and we would not have incurred those costs if the contract had not been obtained. We recognize an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract if the costs (i) are specifically identifiable to a contract, (ii) enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in future and (iii) are expected to be recovered. Our assets related to costs incurred to obtain a contract consist of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to a customer. Based on the policy above, we capitalize a portion of our commission costs as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract. When calculating the incremental cost of obtaining a contract, we exclude any commission costs related to metrics that could be satisfied without obtaining a contract, including training-related metrics. We amortize our commission costs to sales and marketing expense on our consolidated statements of operations over a period of 
three years
, which is consistent with the period over which the products and services related to the commission are transferred to the customer. The 
three-year
 period was determined based on our review of historical enhancements and upgrades to our products and services. We applied the portfolio approach to account for the amortization of contract costs for those contracts that have similar characteristics. Upfront payments made to a customer are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit and are recorded as a reduction to revenue.
Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract. All of the deferred revenue presented in the consolidated balance sheets represents contract liabilities resulting from advance cash receipts from customers or amounts billed in advance to customers from the sale of services. Changes in deferred revenue are due to our performance under the contract as well as to cash received from new contracts for which services have not been provided.
Research and Development
Our research and development costs consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our employees working on our product development and software and device engineering teams, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel costs. Our research and development of new products and services is a multidisciplinary effort across our product management, program management, software engineering, device engineering, quality engineering, configuration management and network operations teams. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as consulting and professional fees paid to third-party development resources. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platforms and applications, support our technology infrastructure, develop new capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing.
Fair Value Measurements
The accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date;
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly; quoted prices in markets that are not active; and
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity.
The carrying amount of financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, as well as accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity and liquidity of those instruments.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis - In 2024 and 2023, we recorded assets for our money market accounts and liabilities for a contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis. In 2024 we recorded assets for our equity securities with readily determinable fair values on a recurring basis. Prior to the termination of the long-term incentive plan with one of our subsidiaries in May 2022, we recorded liabilities for the long-term incentive plan at fair value on a recurring basis.
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis - We measure certain assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and intangible and long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Additionally, equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments become available.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consists principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables. All of our cash and cash equivalents are held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. Our cash and cash equivalent accounts may exceed federally insured limits at times. We mitigate the risk of loss for our cash and cash equivalents by depositing funds with a number of reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds. We have not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalents to date. To manage accounts receivable risk, we evaluate the credit worthiness of our service provider partners and maintain an allowance for credit losses. The majority of our accounts receivable balance is due from our service provider partners in North America. We assess the concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivables based on 
one
 industry and 
one
 geographic region and believe our reserve for uncollectible accounts is appropriate based on our history and this concentration.
Stock-Based Compensation
We compensate our executive officers, board of directors and employees with stock-based compensation plans under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. We record stock-based compensation expense related to time-based restricted stock units based upon the award’s grant date fair value and use an accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. We record stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units based on management’s determination of the probable outcome of the performance conditions and we record a cumulative adjustment in periods in which there is a change in the estimated number of shares expected to vest. Our equity awards generally vest over 
five years
 and are settled in shares of our common stock. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized compensation expense of $
41.2
 million, $
47.3
 million and $
52.7
 million, respectively. During 2024 and 2022 we recognized an associated tax windfall benefit from stock-based awards of $
1.8
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively. During 2023, we recognized a tax shortfall from stock-based awards of $
0.5
 million. We account for stock-based compensation arrangements with non-employees based upon the award’s grant date fair value. We estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which contains uncertainties and requires us to estimate the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. Beginning upon the first grant of options in 2022, the expected term for options granted is estimated using our historical experience, including information related to options we have granted.
Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 
90
% of the fair market value of the closing price on the purchase date. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that a participant may purchase during any calendar year is limited to the lesser of 
10
% of the participant's base compensation for that year or the number of shares with a fair market value of $
15,000
. The 2015 ESPP is considered compensatory for purposes of share-based compensation expense. Compensation expense is recognized for the amount of the discount, net of actual forfeitures, over the 
six-month
 purchase period.
401(k) Defined Contribution Plan
We adopted the Alarm.com Holdings 401(k) Plan, or the Plan, on April 30, 2009. All of our employees are eligible to participate in the Plan. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our discretionary match was 
100
% of employee contributions up to 
10
% of salary and up to a $
5,000
 maximum match.
 We recognized compensation expense of $
7.5
 million, $
7.2
 million and $
6.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to our matching contributions.
Business Combinations
We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. This valuation requires management to apply significant judgment in estimating the fair value of long-lived and intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. 
Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing certain acquired customer relationship intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows and discount rates. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing acquired developed technology intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, obsolescence factors and discount rates. Significant estimates and assumptions in valuing acquired trade name intangible assets include estimates about future expected cash flows, royalty rates and discount rates.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
During the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. 
Some acquisitions may include contingent consideration, which is an obligation to make future payments to the seller contingent upon the achievement of future operational or financial targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated on a quarterly basis and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination, over (2) the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on October 1 and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. We test our goodwill at the reporting unit level. We perform either a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis every year depending on the changes to our goodwill balance as well as changes in our business and the economy. Qualitative factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company specific events, changes in circumstances and market capitalization. The amount of goodwill impairment is calculated as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
For our 2024 annual impairment review, we performed a qualitative assessment for our Alarm.com reporting unit, our only reporting unit with a goodwill balance. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that there was 
no
 goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2024. Our assessment was performed as of October 1, 2024, and we have determined there has been no triggering events that resulted in goodwill impairment from our assessment date through December 31, 2024.
Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets
Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets with definite lives and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives and long-lived assets are measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we determined there were 
no
 impairments of our intangible assets with definite lives or other long-lived assets.
Advertising Costs
We expense advertising costs as incurred.
 Advertising costs totaled $
6.6
 million, $
2.9
 million and $
6.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Advertising costs are primarily included within sales and marketing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 740, "
Income Taxes
," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. We record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position, and (2) with respect to those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties as a component of our income tax provision.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method and present treasury stock, including any applicable commissions and fees, as a component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of equity. As of January 1, 2023, we are subject to a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. When applicable, the excise tax will be included as part of the cost basis of shares acquired and is presented within stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Treasury stock held by us may be retired or reissued in the future.
Earnings per Share
Our basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
Our diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock when determining the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of the diluted net income per share calculation, restricted stock units, options to purchase common stock and unvested shares issued upon the early exercise of options that are subject to repurchase are considered to be potential common stock. 
We use the treasury stock method when calculating the dilutive impact of the stock options and restricted stock units on net income per share. We use the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes on net income per share. As a result, we included 
3,396,950
 shares related to the 2026 Notes and 
3,365,132
 shares related to the 2029 Notes within the weighted average shares outstanding when calculating the diluted net income per share. Additionally, we included interest expense and debt issuance cost amortization, net of tax, within the numerator of the diluted net income per share.
Our redeemable noncontrolling interests are related to our 
86
% equity ownership interest in OpenEye and our 
85
% equity ownership interest in Noonlight. When calculating net income attributable to the common stockholders, net loss attributable to our redeemable noncontrolling interests should be excluded from net income. As a result, net income attributable to the common stockholders is equal to the net income less the net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests as of the end of each period.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted
On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280),” which revises the disclosure requirements about a public entity’s reportable segments and a reportable segment’s expenses. This amendment requires a public entity to (i) disclose significant segment expense that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (ii) disclose an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition and (iii) provide annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods. This amendment is required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented.

Note 3. 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Contract Assets
Our assets related to costs incurred to obtain a contract consist of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers. The current portion of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers is included in other current assets within our consolidated balance sheets. The non-current portion of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers is reflected in other assets within our consolidated balance sheets. 
We review the capitalized costs for impairment at least annually. Impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset recognized from contract costs exceeds the remaining amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing the goods and services to which such asset relates, less the costs that relate directly to providing those good and services and that have not been recognized as an expense. We did 
no
t record an impairment loss on our contract assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Acquisitions
Asset Acquisitions
On November 22, 2024, EnergyHub International, Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired certain assets of Finland-based Kapacity.io Solutions Oy. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of developed technology. We believe the acquisition of the developed technology will help accelerate deployment of a cloud-based demand response platform internationally for our EnergyHub subsidiary.
In consideration for the purchase of the developed technology, we paid $
1.3
 million in cash in November 2024, after deducting $
0.2
 million related to an agreed holdback provision. Additionally, we incurred $
0.1
 million in direct transaction costs related to legal fees during 2024 that were capitalized as a component of the consideration transferred. The $
1.6
 million purchase price consideration related to developed technology was recorded as an intangible asset at the time of the asset acquisition and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 
seven years
. The asset acquisition was recorded within our Other segment.
On April 21, 2023, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired certain assets of Vintra, Inc., or Vintra. Substantially all of the acquired assets consisted of developed technology.

In consideration for the purchase of the acquired assets, we paid $
5.5
 million in cash on April 21, 2023, after deducting $
0.3
 million related to the settlement of an outstanding loan issued to Vintra during March 2023 and $
1.0
 million related to an agreed holdback provision. The holdback was fully paid by the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, we incurred $

85
% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Noonlight.

None
 of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes in future periods. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on expected benefit from synergies and have allocated the goodwill to the Alarm.com segment. 
Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired and Intangibles
The acquired activities and assets in the purchase of Noonlight constituted a business and with the exception of contract liabilities accounted for under Topic 606, in accordance with ASC 805, "

ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
recorded at their respective fair values as of September 23, 2022. We developed the fair value of intangible net assets using a multi-period excess earnings method for developed technology and the relief from royalty method for the trade name.
Developed Technology
Developed technology primarily consists of intellectual property of proprietary software that is marketed for sale. We valued the developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings method, an income approach. The significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates about future expected cash flows from the developed technology, the obsolescence factor and the discount rate. We are amortizing the Noonlight developed technology, valued at $
9.3
 million, on an attribution method based on the discounted cash flows of the model over an estimated useful life of 
seven years
.
Trade Names
We valued the trade names acquired using a relief from royalty method. The significant assumptions used in the income approach include future expected cash flows from the trade name, the royalty rate and the discount rate. We are amortizing the trade names, valued at $
0.2
 million, on an attribution basis derived from the discounted cash flows of the model over an estimated useful life of 
five years
.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
We have a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to our 
85
% equity ownership interest in Noonlight. The Noonlight stockholder agreement contains a put option that gives the minority Noonlight stockholders the right to sell their remaining 
15
% equity ownership interest to us based on the fair value of the shares and also contains a call option that gives us the right to purchase the remaining Noonlight shares from the minority Noonlight stockholders based on the fair value of the shares. The put and call options can each be exercised beginning in the first quarter of 2026. This redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded at fair value on September 23, 2022, by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs for projected cash flows, including projected financial results and a discount rate, which are considered Level 3 inputs. This redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and we report it between liabilities and stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The redemption value of the Noonlight noncontrolling interest was $
5.2
 million and $
6.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Business Combinations in Operations - Noonlight
The operations of the Noonlight business combination discussed above were included in the consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date. The pro forma information as well as the revenue and net losses of the business combination were not material to the consolidated financial statements in the year of acquisition.

Other Assets
Loan to a Distribution Partner
In December 2022, we amended a subordinated credit agreement with the Affiliate. The amended subordinated credit agreement with the Affiliate matures on June 18, 2027, and interest on the outstanding principal balance accrues at a rate of 
12.0
% per annum and is payable in kind. In March 2024, the Affiliate was in default on a loan arrangement with one of its third party secured lenders. Based on this information, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded a credit loss expense of $
4.0
 million in general and administrative expense and recorded a reduction to our interest income of $
0.5
 million related to the reversal of payable in kind interest associated with the subordinated credit agreement. We placed this loan in nonaccrual status and recorded a full allowance for credit losses for this note receivable as of March 31, 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we wrote off the entire $
4.0
 million outstanding note receivable balance that originated in 2017 and reversed the previously recorded allowance for credit losses. As of December 31, 2023, $
4.5
 million of the notes receivable balance related to the subordinated credit agreement was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $
2.6
 million, $
3.0
 million and $
2.7
 million of revenue from the distribution partner associated with these loans, respectively.
Loan to a Service Provider Partner
In
 July 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with a service provider partner, under which we agreed to loan the service provider partner up to 
$
2.5
 million
, collateralized by the assets of the service provider partner. Interest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum 
equal to 
9.0
% and monthly interest and principal payments began in April 2021. The maturity date of the loan is July 24, 2025. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
1.0
 million of principal was outstanding from the service provider partner under the loan agreement.
For each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $
0.2
 million of revenue from the service provider partner associated with this loan.
Loan to a Technology Partner 
In June 2022, we entered into a convertible promissory note with a technology partner, under which we agreed to loan the technology partner $
1.5
 million. Interest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum equal to 
6.5
%, starting one year from the effective date of the loan. Interest and principal payments are due on the maturity date of the loan, which is June 27, 2029, unless the loan is converted prior to the maturity date, which may occur upon a qualified financing event, as defined in the convertible promissory note, upon a sale of the technology partner or upon our election on the maturity date of the loan. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
1.5
 million of principal was outstanding from the technology partner under the convertible promissory note.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did 
not
 record any revenue from the technology partner associated with this convertible promissory note.
Investment in a Hardware Supplier
In October 2018, we entered into a subordinate convertible promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers. In July 2019, we converted the outstanding notes receivable balance of $
5.6
 million into 
9,520,832
 shares of Series B preferred stock in the hardware supplier. We concluded that the $
5.6
 million equity investment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation and will be accounted for using the measurement alternative. Under the alternative, we measure investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes

from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment in the hardware supplier was $
5.6
 million.
Investments in Technology Partners
In February 2021, we paid $
5.0
 million in cash to purchase 
1,000,000
 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock from a technology partner as part of a financing round that included other investors. The $
5.0
 million equity investment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation and is accounted for using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, we measure investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment in the technology partner was $
5.7
 million.
In December 2022, we paid $
5.1
 million in cash to another technology partner to purchase 
4,231,717
 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock. The $
5.1
 million equity investment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation and is accounted for using the measurement alternative. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment in the technology partner was $
5.1
 million.
In December 2023, we paid $
1.5
 million to another technology partner as part of a Simple Agreement for Future Equity, or SAFE. We paid an additional $
1.5
 million during both May 2024 and December 2024 in the same technology partner via a SAFE for a total investment of $
4.5
 million. The SAFE provides us the right to be issued certain shares of the technology partner's stock in connection with a qualified equity financing or liquidity event. Our investment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation and is accounted for using the measurement alternative. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment in the privately-held company was $
4.5
 million and $
1.5
 million, respectively.

ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
As of December 31, 2024, $
1.20
 billion of our money market accounts was included in cash and cash equivalents, $
6.2
 million was included in other assets and $
1.9
 million was included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, $
675.6
 million of our money market accounts was included in cash and cash equivalents and $
4.1
 million was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our assets from money market accounts are valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our equity securities with readily determinable fair value represent our investments in publicly traded companies, which are valued using quoted prices in active markets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an unrealized loss on equity securities of less than $
0.1
 million. Our investments in public entities are recorded at fair value within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value of the investments are recorded within other (expense) / income, net within our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 13 for the carrying amount and estimated fair value of our convertible senior notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
We previously maintained a subsidiary long-term incentive plan and recorded a liability based on the potential cash payment contingent upon meeting certain financial milestones related to the agreement established with certain employees of one of our subsidiaries. This incentive plan was established in November 2017 and the amount of compensation awarded to employees depended on the fair market value of the subsidiary, which was determined in part by the subsidiary’s projected financial results. We accounted for the subsidiary long-term incentive plan using fair value and established liabilities for the future payments under the terms of the incentive plan based on estimating revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin of the subsidiary over the period of the incentive plan through the anticipated achievement of the milestones. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model which involves several Level 3 unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation included a weighted average revenue volatility and the revenue risk adjustment. The revenue volatility was weighted using revenue volatility results from the subsidiary’s peer group as well as market transaction metrics. The revenue risk adjustment was calculated using capital structure allocations from the subsidiary’s peer group, market transaction metrics as well as United States Treasury yields.
In May 2022, we terminated the subsidiary long-term incentive plan. The fair value of the liability related to the subsidiary long-term incentive plan as of the termination date was consistent with the liability as of March 31, 2022. Concurrent with the termination of the subsidiary long-term incentive plan, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to those employees who previously participated in the subsidiary long-term incentive plan. We accounted for the termination of the subsidiary long-term incentive plan and concurrent grant of performance-based restricted stock units as a modification of the original subsidiary long-term incentive plan. As a result, we reclassified the $
3.1
 million liability related to the subsidiary long-term incentive plan to additional paid-in capital during the three months ended June 30, 2022. Additionally, we recorded $
1.2
 million in incremental compensation costs as additional stock-based compensation expense to the applicable operating expense category based on the respective employee’s function (sales and marketing, general and administrative or research and development) during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The incremental compensation costs represented the excess of the fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units over the fair value of the subsidiary long-term incentive plan as of the modification date of the subsidiary long-term incentive plan.
The contingent consideration liability consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 
100
% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of EBS on January 18, 2023. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain performance targets related to the integration of EBS's hardware into the Alarm.com platform by December 31, 2025, and has a maximum potential payment of up to $
2.5
 million. We account for the contingent consideration using fair value and established a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of the probability of the future achievement of the performance targets. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the probability of expected achievement of the performance targets. At January 18, 2023, the fair value of the liability was $
2.0
 million. At each reporting date until December 31, 2025, or the achievement of the performance targets, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is included within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In 2024 and 2023, the contingent consideration liability did not materially change from the acquisition date fair value of $
2.0
 million as there were minor changes in the expected probability of achievement for the performance targets. The unobservable inputs used in the valuation as of December 31, 2024 included a weighted average expected achievement percentage of 
89.5
%, weighted by the potential payout of the performance targets, including a range of 
80.0
% to 
99.0
%. The valuation also included a weighted average discount rate of 
6.1
%, weighted by the probability of achievement of the performance targets at various dates, including a range of 
6.0
% to 
6.2
%. Selecting another probability of expected achievement or discount rate within an acceptable range would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.
We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and no transfers into Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no reclassifications between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Leases
As of December 31, 2024, we leased office space, data centers and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2034. In August 2014, we signed a lease for office space in Tysons, Virginia where we relocated our corporate headquarters to in February 2016. We have subsequently entered into amendments to this lease to provide us with additional office space as well as tenant improvement allowances. In August 2024, we entered into an amendment to the lease for our corporate headquarters, which extends the term of our existing leased office space to 2034 and includes 
two
 successive 
five-year
 renewal options. Additionally, the amendment provides for additional office space, parking spaces and tenant improvement allowances.

Debt, Commitments and Contingencies
The debt, commitments and contingencies described below would require us, or our subsidiaries, to make payments to third parties under certain circumstances.
Convertible Senior Notes - 2026 Notes
On January 20, 2021, we issued $
500.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
0
% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the 2026 Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the 2026 Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $
484.3
 million, net of $
15.7
 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs.
We may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the 2026 Notes, at our option, on or after January 20, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes.
The 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2026 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 business day period immediately after any 
10
 consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes for such trading day was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2026 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2026 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the 2026 Indenture.
115
ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
On or after August 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2026 Notes, holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2026 Notes with cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Notes is 6.7939 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $
147.19
 per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2026 Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of the 2026 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2026 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2026 Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2026 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the 2026 Indenture), as the case may be.
If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the 2026 Indenture), subject to certain exceptions and except as described in the 2026 Indenture, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2026 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The 2026 Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2026 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving us after which the 2026 Notes become automatically due and payable.
We used some of the proceeds to repay the $
110.0
 million outstanding principal balance under our credit facility and also used some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to our credit facility, which was terminated effective January 20, 2021. We are using the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies.
As discussed in Note 2, we adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective adoption method. Prior to the adoption of the standard, the 2026 Notes were separated into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that did not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2026 Notes. The equity component was recorded in additional paid-in capital and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. The difference between the book and tax treatment of the debt discount and debt issuance costs of the 2026 Notes resulted in a difference between the carrying amount and tax basis of the 2026 Notes.
Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, we recombined the liability and equity components of the 2026 Notes assuming that the instrument was accounted for as only a liability from inception to the date of adoption. We also recombined the liability and equity components of the debt issuance costs. The issuance costs are presented as a deduction from the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Notes and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2026 Notes at a rate of 
0.6
%. We also removed the temporary difference between the book and tax treatment of the debt discount and adjusted the temporary difference between the book and tax treatment of the debt issuance costs of the 2026 Notes.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our 2026 Notes was $
473.8
 million and $
444.8
 million, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the quoted price of the 2026 Notes in an inactive market on the last traded day of the quarter and has been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $
60.80
 on the last trading day of the quarter, the if-converted value of the 2026 Notes did not exceed the principal amount of $
500.0
 million as of December 31, 2024.

Convertible Senior Notes - 2029 Notes
On May 31, 2024, we issued $
500.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
2.25
% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2029 Notes. The terms of the 2029 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the 2029 Indenture, by and between Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that bear interest at a rate of 
2.25
% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024, and the principal amount of the 2029 Notes will not accrete. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $
485.2
 million, net of $
14.8
 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. 
We may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the 2029 Notes (subject to the partial redemption limitation described below), at our option, on or after June 7, 2027, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2029 Notes then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If we redeem less than all the 2029 Notes, at least $
75.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2029 Notes.
The 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 1, 2029, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2029 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 business day period immediately after any 
10
 consecutive trading day period in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes for such trading day was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2029 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the 2029 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2029 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the 2029 Indenture.
On or after January 1, 2029, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2029 Notes, holders of the 2029 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2029 Notes with cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes is 11.4571 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $
87.28
 per share of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2029 Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2029 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of some or all of the 2029 Notes, we will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2029 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2029 Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2029 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the 2029 Indenture), as the case may be. 
If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Indenture), subject to certain exceptions and except as described in the 2029 Indenture, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The 2029 Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2029 Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving us after which the 2029 Notes become automatically due and payable.

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
We used $
63.1
 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below and used $
75.0
 million to repurchase 
1,117,068
 shares of our common stock concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, which was separately authorized by our board of directors. We are using the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies, other repurchases of our common stock, repurchases of our 2026 Notes and for working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.
We account for the 2029 Notes as a liability. The debt issuance costs are presented as a deduction from the outstanding principal balance of the 2029 Notes and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2029 Notes at a rate of 
2.9
%.
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of our 2029 Notes was $
496.7
 million. The fair value was determined based on the quoted price of the 2029 Notes in an inactive market on the last traded day of the quarter and has been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $
60.80
 on the last trading day of the quarter, the if-converted value of the 2029 Notes did not exceed the principal amount of $
500.0
 million as of December 31, 2024.

Capped Call – 2029 Notes
In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers and certain other financial institutions, at a cost of $
63.1
 million. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2029 Notes, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2029 Notes. The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially $
134.28
 per share of our common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 28, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The exercise price is $
87.28
 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments that mirror corresponding adjustments for the 2029 Notes.
We elected to integrate the capped call options with the 2029 Notes for federal income tax purposes pursuant to applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. Accordingly, the $
63.1
 million cost of the purchased capped calls will be deductible for income tax purposes. The original issue discount is accreted over the term of the 2029 Notes.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of the 2029 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2029 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. As the capped call options are both legally detachable and separately exercisable from the 2029 Notes, we account for the capped call options separately from the 2029 Notes. The capped call options are indexed to our own common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity. As such, the premiums paid for the capped call options were included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. The capped call transactions will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.
Acquired Debt - EBS
On January 18, 2023, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries acquired 
100
% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EBS. As part of this acquisition we acquired $
2.9
 million of outstanding debt, which had decreased to 
zero
 as of December 31, 2023.
Commitments and Contingencies
Indemnification Agreements
We have various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party to the agreement with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business. Although we cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments that may become due under these indemnification agreements, we do not believe any potential liability that might arise from such indemnity provisions is probable or material.
Legal Proceedings
On January 10, 2022, EcoFactor, Inc., or EcoFactor, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, alleging Alarm.com’s products and services directly and indirectly infringe 
five
 U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking a permanent injunction, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. EcoFactor had previously asserted 
two
 of the same patents against us in an October 2019 complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC. In July 2021, the ITC found in favor of Alarm.com. EcoFactor appealed the decision but withdrew its appeal in December 2021. We moved to dismiss the Oregon case for failure to state a claim on March 28, 2022. On April 18, 2022, the district court stayed the case at the request of the parties pending the disposition of other proceedings involving the asserted patents. These proceedings include 
four
 ex parte reexamination proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and one inter partes review. 
Two
 of the patents were found unpatentable in reexamination, and EcoFactor appealed the decision with respect to one of the patents to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on July 9, 2024, while its time to appeal the second decision has not yet expired. The ex parte reexamination of a third patent is still ongoing, and ex parte reexamination of a fourth patent concluded on August 23, 2023 after the claims were amended. On April 18, 2022, all claims of a fifth patent were found unpatentable by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, in inter partes review, and all claims were canceled on February 1, 2024.
Should EcoFactor prevail in its lawsuit we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to EcoFactor’s claims, the outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our business. Based on currently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.
On July 22, 2021, Causam Enterprises, Inc., or Causam, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, alleging that Alarm.com’s smart thermostats infringe 
four
 U.S. patents owned by Causam. Causam is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees. We have not yet responded to the complaint. On September 3, 2021, the court issued an order staying the lawsuit until the ITC investigation described below is finally resolved.
On July 28, 2021, Causam filed a complaint with the ITC naming Alarm.com Incorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., and EnergyHub, Inc., among others, as proposed respondents. The complaint alleges infringement of the same 
four
 patents Causam asserted in district court. Causam is seeking a permanent limited exclusion order and permanent cease and desist order. On August 27, 2021, the ITC instituted an investigation into Causam’s allegations naming Alarm.com Incorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., EnergyHub Inc. and others as respondents. We answered the complaint on October 4, 2021. Among other things, we asserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. An evidentiary hearing in the investigation was held from June 28, 2022 through July 1, 2022. On February 16, 2023, the ITC issued a final decision in favor of Alarm.com and EnergyHub. Causam filed an appeal of the ITC decision on April 14, 2023. Causam did not appeal the ITC decision with respect to Alarm.com and EnergyHub.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
Should Causam prevail in its district court lawsuit we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to Causam’s claims, the outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our business. Based on currently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time. 
In addition to the matters described above, we may be required to provide indemnification to certain of our service provider partners for certain claims regarding our solutions. For example, we incurred costs associated with the indemnification of our service provider Central Security Group – Nationwide, Inc. (d/b/a Alert 360), or CSG, in an ongoing patent litigation. In 2018, Ubiquitous Connectivity, LP, or Ubiquitous, brought suit against CSG in U.S. District Court, Northern District of Oklahoma, alleging infringement of 
two
 U.S. patents. The case was stayed by agreement of the parties for several years while the patents in suit were challenged before the PTAB. In January 2021, the PTAB deemed 
42
 out of 
46
 claims of the 
two
 asserted patents unpatentable. Ubiquitous appealed a portion of the PTAB’s findings to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s ruling on August 8, 2023. As a result, only 
four
 patent claims remain at issue and the Northern District of Oklahoma case is no longer stayed. The case is currently in the discovery phase. The court held a claim construction hearing on December 12, 2024, but has not yet rendered a claim construction opinion. A hearing on dispositive motions, including for summary judgment, is scheduled for April 15, 2026. A trial is scheduled for July 6, 2026.
Should Ubiquitous prevail on its infringement claims, we could be required to indemnify CSG for damages in the form of a reasonable royalty or of Ubiquitous’s lost profits. CSG could be enjoined from making, using, and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling our technology is not made available or if we are unable to design around such patents, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. The outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty. Based on currently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.
We may also be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Other than the preceding matters, we are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding that, in the opinion of management, is reasonably possible or probable of having a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We reserve for contingent liabilities based on ASC 450, "
Contingencies
," when it is determined that a liability, inclusive of defense costs, is probable and reasonably estimable. Litigation is subject to many factors that are difficult to predict, so there can be no assurance that, in the event of a material unfavorable result in one or more claims, we will not incur material costs.
Note 14. 
Stockholders' Equity
Authorized shares
We are authorized to issue 
two
 classes of stock, common stock and preferred stock. On June 9, 2015, the board of directors amended and restated our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, effective upon the closing of our initial public offering, or IPO, on July 1, 2015, and authorized us to issue up to 
300,000,000
 shares of common stock and 
10,000,000
 shares of undesignated preferred stock.
Common and Preferred Stock
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
52,756,077
 and 
51,888,838
 shares of common stock issued, and 
49,618,346
 and 
49,868,175
 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 preferred shares issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote per share.
Stock Repurchase Programs
On December 3, 2020, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, under which we were authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $
100.0
 million of our outstanding common stock during the 
three-year
 period ending December 3, 2023. On February 15, 2023, our board of directors authorized the cancellation of the balance under the stock repurchase program ending December 3, 2023, and also authorized a stock repurchase program, effective February 23, 2023, under which we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $
100.0
 million of our outstanding common stock during the 
two-year
 period ending February 23, 2025.

ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
On May 24, 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the cancellation of the balance under the stock repurchase program ending February 23, 2025, and also authorized a stock repurchase program, effective May 31, 2024, under which we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $
100.0
 million of our outstanding common stock during the 
two-year
 period ending May 31, 2026. The full repurchase balance for this program of $
100.0
 million was available as of December 31, 2024.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 
1,117,068
 shares of our common stock for $
75.0
 million concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, which was separately authorized by our board of directors. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 
487,918
 and 
1,385,592
 shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs that were subsequently canceled effective May 31, 2024 and February 15, 2023, for $
27.3
 million and $
78.8
 million, respectively, which includes applicable commissions and fees. As of January 1, 2023, we are subject to a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. When applicable, the excise tax will be included as part of the cost basis of shares acquired and is presented within stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
Shares Withheld
As permitted under the terms of the 2015 Plan, in 2021 the Compensation Committee authorized the withholding of shares of common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards issued to employees to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements. These withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. We paid $
3.4
 million and $
2.6
 million of tax withholdings related to vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
No
 tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock units were paid during the year ended December 31, 2022. We also utilized the sell-to-cover method in which shares of our restricted stock unit awards were sold into the market on behalf of the employee upon vesting to cover tax withholding liabilities. We may utilize either the withholding method or sell-to-cover method in the future.

2015 Equity Incentive Plan

We issue stock options pursuant to our 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan allows for the grant of stock options to employees and for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to our employees, directors and non-employee directors.
In June 2015, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2015 Plan pursuant to which we initially reserved a total of 
4,700,000
 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which included shares of our common 
121
ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
stock previously reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan automatically increased on January 1 each year, commencing on January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2024, by 
5.0
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. As a result of the adoption of the 2015 Plan, 
no
 further grants may be made under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 
11,533,781
 shares remained available for future grant under the 2015 Plan. In December 2023, our board of directors determined that the January 1, 2024 increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan would be 
5.0
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31, 2023, or 
2,493,408
 shares. In November 2022, our board of directors determined that the January 1, 2023 increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan would be 
5.0
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31, 2022, or 
2,472,635
 shares.
Stock Options
Stock options under the 2015 Plan have been granted at exercise prices based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options under the 2009 Plan were granted at exercise prices as determined by the board of directors to be the fair market value of our common stock. Our stock options generally vest over a 
five-year
 period and each option, if not exercised or forfeited, expires on the 
ten
th anniversary of the grant date. 
Certain stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and previously granted under the 2009 Plan may be exercised before the options have vested. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The proceeds from the early exercise of stock options are initially recorded as a current liability and are reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses. There were 
no
 unvested shares of common stock outstanding subject to our right of repurchase as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We did 
not
 repurchase any unvested shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options in connection with employee terminations during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. There were 
no
 proceeds from the early exercise of the unvested stock options reflected in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
We account for stock-based compensation options based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche.
We value our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. Beginning upon the first grant of options in 2022, the expected term for options granted is estimated using our historical experience, including information related to options we have granted. The expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. 
There were 
138,750
, 
237,400
 and 
184,500
 stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We declared and paid dividends in June 2015 in anticipation of our IPO, which we closed on July 1, 2015. Subsequent to the IPO, we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on a recurring basis. As such, we assume that the dividend rate is 
0
%.

There was an aggregate of 
628,394
, 
558,747
 and 
1,123,076
 RSUs without performance conditions granted to certain of our employees and directors during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were 
no
 RSUs with performance conditions granted during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. There was an aggregate of 
168,223
 RSUs with performance conditions granted to certain of our employees during the year ended December 31, 2022. The time-based RSUs vest over a 
five-year
 period from the vesting commencement date, which is generally the grant date. The performance-based RSUs vest when the related performance conditions are met. Vested RSUs include the amount of shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees, when applicable. 
We account for RSUs based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for time-based RSUs using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the grant date to the vesting date for that tranche.
 The condition for vesting of the RSUs is based on continued employment. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for performance-based RSUs based on management’s determination of the probable outcome of the performance conditions and we record a cumulative adjustment in periods in which there is a change in the estimated number of shares expected to vest. As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs without performance conditions was $
57.4
 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
2.4
 years. As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs with performance conditions was $

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our board of directors adopted our 2015 ESPP in June 2015. As of December 31, 2024, 
1,866,044
 shares have been reserved for future grant under the 2015 ESPP, with provisions established to increase the number of shares available on January 1 of each subsequent year for 
nine years
. The annual automatic increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 ESPP was the lesser of 
1
% of each class of common stock outstanding as of December 31 of the preceding fiscal year, 
1,500,000
 shares of common stock, or such lesser number as determined by the board of directors. There was no increase to the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP in 2022, 2023 or 2024. The 2015 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 
90
% of the fair market value, rounded up to the nearest cent, based on the closing price of our common stock on the purchase date. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that a participant may purchase during any calendar year shall not exceed such number of shares having a fair market value equal to the lesser of $
15,000
 or 
10
% of the participant's base compensation for that year.
The 2015 ESPP is considered compensatory for purposes of share-based compensation expense due to the 
10
% discount on the fair market value of the common stock. An aggregate of 
29,946
, 
33,639
 and 
24,994
 shares were purchased by employees for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for which we recognized $
0.2
 million of compensation expense during each of those years. Compensation expense is recognized for the amount of the discount, net of actual forfeitures and voluntary withdrawals, over the 
six-month
 purchase period.

We use the treasury stock method when calculating the dilutive impact of the stock options and restricted stock units on net income per share. We use the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes on net income per share. As a result, we included 
3,396,950
 shares related to the 2026 Notes within the weighted average shares outstanding when calculating the diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. We included 
3,365,132
 shares related to the 2029 Notes within the weighted averages shares outstanding when calculating the diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2024. Additionally, we included $
8.6

% and

% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed, the foreign derived intangible income deduction and tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of state taxes, foreign withholding taxes and other nondeductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate 
127
ALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed and the foreign derived intangible income deduction, partially offset by the impact of state taxes, foreign withholding taxes, federal estimated tax payment interest expense, other nondeductible expenses and a stock-based compensation tax shortfall. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed, foreign derived intangible income deductions and tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of nondeductible expenses, foreign withholding taxes and state taxes.
We recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of net deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 Our valuation allowance for state research and development tax credit carryforwards and net deferred tax assets of our EBS subsidiary was $
5.0
 million, $
3.8
 million and $
2.6
 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We apply guidance for uncertainty in income taxes that requires the application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of uncertain tax positions. If the recognition threshold is met, this guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
 We recorded a net increase to the unrecognized tax benefits liability of $
0.1
 million, primarily due to a liability for research and development tax credits claimed, partially offset by the closure of the 2018 and 2019 Internal Revenue Service federal income tax return examination and the release of a state unrecognized tax benefit liability due to the statute of limitations expiration during the year ended December 31, 2024. We recorded a net increase to the unrecognized tax benefits liability of $
1.5
 million and $
2.1
 million primarily for research and development tax credits claimed during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe it is reasonably possible within the next 12 months that a decrease of up to $
1.3
 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations.
Our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 includes unrecognized tax benefits of $
9.1
 million and $
8.9
 million, respectively, that if recognized, would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our consolidated balance sheets included a $
0.9
 million and $
0.8
 million accrual for total interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
As of December 31, 2024, we had gross U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
5.9
 million, which will begin to expire in 2031, and Canadian federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
0.1
 million, which are scheduled to begin to expire in 2034. As of December 31, 2024, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $
4.6
 million, which will begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2024, we had less than $
0.1
 million of federal research and development tax credit carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2041. As of December 31, 2024, we had state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
5.0
 million, which will begin to expire in 2030. The federal net operating loss carryforward arose in connection with the 2013 acquisition of EnergyHub and the 2022 acquisition of Noonlight. Utilization of the acquired EnergyHub and Noonlight net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to ownership change limitations as provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Our tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in our tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. On October 13, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of our federal income tax return for 2018 and on August 12, 2022, the Internal Revenue Service expanded the examination to include our federal income tax return for 2019. On January 25, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service notified us that the income tax examination of our 2018 and 2019 federal income tax returns has been closed. As a result, we paid $
0.6
 million in additional federal taxes, including interest, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and recognized a net income tax benefit of $
1.7
 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, we did not have material undistributed foreign earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. 
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted in the United States which, among other provisions, includes a minimum 15.0% tax on companies that have a three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income of more than $1.0 billion and a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock repurchases. Both provisions became effective on January 1, 2023 and the provisions did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented.

Note 20. 
Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)
The following table shows selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of our eight most recently completed quarters. In the opinion of management, the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals, necessary for the fair statement of financial information in accordance with GAAP. However, the global economy, credit markets and financial markets have and may continue to experience significant volatility as a result of Macroeconomic Conditions. These Macroeconomic Conditions have and may continue to create tariffs, supply chain disruptions, inventory disruptions, and fluctuations in economic growth, including fluctuations in employment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer sentiment. It remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions.

Subsequent Events
Loan to a Service Provider Partner
On January 30, 2025, we entered into a senior secured loan agreement with a service provider partner, under which a term loan was provided to the service provider partner in the original principal amount of $
21.5
 million, which loan is collateralized by the assets of the service provider partner. Quarterly principal payments begin in the second quarter of 2027. Interest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum equal to the overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a period of three months, plus 
3.0
%. For the first 
two years
 of the loan, monthly interest payments can be payable in kind at the election of the borrower. The maturity date of the loan is January 30, 2030.
Acquisition
On February 10, 2025, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 
81
% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of CHeKT, Inc., or CHeKT. CHeKT provides a remote video monitoring service for central station operators that is compatible with a variety of cameras. We believe the acquisition of CHeKT will help to expand our opportunity to provide remote video monitoring solutions in the commercial and residential markets.
In consideration for the purchase of 
81
% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of CHeKT, we paid $
23.6
 million in cash on February 10, 2025, after deducting $
3.7
 million related to agreed holdback provisions. We are currently evaluating the accounting treatment of this acquisition and are in the process of completing the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of its evaluation, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The 
report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
 is incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recent fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
