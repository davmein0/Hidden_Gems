Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to "EverCommerce Inc.," the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to EverCommerce Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. An analysis of our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, including a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, has been reported previously in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 14, 2024, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Overview
EverCommerce is a leading provider of integrated, vertically-tailored software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions for service-based small- and medium-sized businesses (“service SMBs”). Our platform spans across the full lifecycle of interactions between consumers and service professionals with vertical-specific applications. Today, we serve more than 740,000 customers across three core verticals: EverPro for Home Services; EverHealth for Health Services; and EverWell for Wellness Services. Within our core verticals, our customers operate within numerous micro-verticals, ranging from home service professionals, such as home improvement contractors and home maintenance technicians, to physician practices and therapists within Health Services, to salon owners within Wellness. Our platform provides vertically-tailored SaaS solutions that address service SMBs’ increasingly specialized demands, as well as highly complementary solutions that provide fully-integrated offerings, allowing service SMBs and EverCommerce to succeed in the market, and provide end consumers more convenient service experiences.
We offer several vertically-tailored suites of solutions, each of which follows a similar and repeatable go-to-market playbook: offer a “system of action” Business Management Software that streamlines daily business workflows, integrate highly complementary, value-add adjacent solutions and complete gaps in the value chain to create integrated solutions. These solutions focus on addressing how service SMBs market their services, streamline operations and retain and engage their customers. 
•
Business Management Software: 
Our vertically-tailored Business Management Software is the system of action at the center of a service business’s operation, and is typically the point-of-entry and first solution adopted by a customer. Our software, designed to meet the day-to-day workflow needs of businesses in specific vertical end markets, streamlines front and back-office processes and provides polished customer-facing experiences. Using these offerings, service SMBs can focus on growing their customers, improving their services and driving more efficient operations. 
•
Billing & Payment Solutions: 
Our Billing & Payment Solutions provide integrated payments, billing and invoicing automation and business intelligence and analytics. Our omni-channel payments capabilities include point-of-sale, eCommerce, online bill payments, recurring billing, electronic invoicing and mobile payments. Supported payment types include credit card, debit card and Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) processing. Our payments platform also provides a full suite of service commerce features, including customer management as well as cash flow reporting and analytics. These value-add features help small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) to ensure more timely billing and payments collection and provide improved cash flow visibility. 
•
Customer Experience Solutions: 
Our Customer Experience Solutions modernize how businesses engage and interact with customers by leveraging innovative, bespoke customer listening and communication solutions to improve the customer experience and increase retention. Our software provides customer listening capabilities with real-time customer surveying and analysis to allow standalone businesses and multi-location brands to receive VoC insights and manage the customer experience lifecycle. These applications include: customer health scoring, customer support systems, real-time alerts, NPS-based customer feedback collection, review generation and automation, reputation management, customer satisfaction surveying and a digital communication suite, among others. These tools help our customers gain actionable insights, increase customer loyalty and repeat purchases and improve customer experiences.
•
Marketing Technology Solutions: 
Our Marketing Technology Solutions work with our Customer Experience Solutions to help customers build their businesses by invigorating marketing operations and improving return on investment across the customer lifecycle. These solutions help businesses to manage campaigns, generate quality leads, increase conversion and repeat sales, improve customer loyalty and provide a polished brand experience. Our solutions include: custom website design, development and hosting, responsive web design, marketing campaign design and management, search engine optimization, paid search and display advertising, social media and blog automation, call tracking, review monitoring and marketplace lead generation, among others. In March 2025, the Company announced the evaluation of strategic alternatives for our Marketing Technology 
II-3
Solutions with an expectation of a probable disposition by sale within the next 12 months.

The Company expects to reflect Marketing Technology Solutions as discontinued operations beginning with its first quarter 2025 financial reporting.
We go to market with suites of solutions that are aligned to our three core verticals. Within each suite, our Business Management Software – the system of action at the center of a service business’ operation – is typically the first solution adopted by a customer. This vertically-tailored point-of-entry provides us with an opportunity to cross-sell adjacent products, previously offered as fragmented and disjointed point solutions by other software providers. This “land and expand” strategy allows us to acquire customers with key foundational solutions and expand into offerings via product development and acquisitions that cover all workflows and power the full scope of our customers’ businesses. This results in a self-reinforcing flywheel effect, enabling us to drive value for our customers and, in turn, improve customer stickiness, increase our market share and fuel our growth.
We generate three types of revenue: (i) Subscription and Transaction Fees, which are primarily recurring revenue streams, (ii) Marketing Technology Solutions, which includes both recurring and re-occurring revenue streams and (iii) Other revenue which consists primarily of one-time revenue streams. Our recurring revenue generally consists of monthly, quarterly and annual software and maintenance subscriptions, transaction revenue associated with integrated payments and billing solutions and monthly contracts for Marketing Technology Solutions. Additionally, our re-occurring revenue includes revenue related to the sale of marketing campaigns and lead generation under contractual arrangements with customers. 
•
Subscription and Transaction Fees revenue includes: (i) recurring monthly, quarterly and annual SaaS subscriptions and software license and maintenance fees from the sale of our Business Management, Customer Engagement and Billing and Payment solutions; (ii) payment processing fees based on the transaction volumes processed through our integrated payment solutions and processing fees based on transaction volumes for our revenue cycle management, chronic care management and health insurance clearinghouse solutions; and (iii) membership subscriptions and our share of rebates from suppliers generated though group purchasing programs. 
•
Marketing Technology Solutions revenue includes: (i) recurring revenues for managing digital advertising programs on behalf of our customers including website hosting, search engine management and optimization, social media management and blog automation; and (ii) re-occurring fees paid by service professionals for consumer leads generated by our various platforms. 
•
Other revenue includes: (i) consulting, implementation, training and other professional services; (ii) website development; (iii) revenue from various business development partnerships; (iv) event income; and (v) hardware sales related to our business management or payment software solutions.
Our business benefits from attractive unit economics. Approximately 97% of our revenue was recurring or re-occurring in both of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and we maintained an annualized net revenue retention rate of approximately 91% and 93% for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our annualized pro forma net revenue retention rate was equal to the annualized net revenue retention rate for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding our marketing technology solutions, our annualized net revenue retention rate for our core software and payments solutions was approximately 96% and 98% for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We believe the retention and growth of revenue from our existing customers is a helpful measure of the health of our business and our future growth prospects. Our ability to cross sell additional products and services to our existing customers can increase customer engagement with our suite of solutions and thus have a positive impact on our net pro forma revenue retention rate. For example, we have leveraged our land and expand strategy to cross sell solutions to our existing customers, which has supported our high net pro forma revenue retention rate by increasing customer utilization of our solutions, educating customers as to how our platform and synergies can support their businesses and, in turn, improving customer stickiness. 
We calculate our annualized net revenue retention rate based on the average of the annualized net revenue retention rate calculated for each month during the twelve-month period as of the most recent quarter end. Our calculation of net revenue retention rate for any fiscal period includes the positive recurring and re-occurring revenue impacts of selling new solutions to existing customers and the negative impacts of contraction and attrition among this set of customers. The annualized net revenue retention rate for a particular month is calculated as the recurring or re-occurring revenue gained/lost from existing customers, less the recurring or re-occurring revenue lost from cancelled customers as a percentage of total recurring or re-occurring revenue during the corresponding month of the prior year. For existing customers, we consider customers that existed 11 or more months prior to the current month and that do not have an end date (i.e., cancelled relationship) on or after the first day of the current month. For example, the recurring or re-occurring revenue gained/lost from existing customers in November 2024 is the difference between the recurring or re-occurring revenue generated in November 2024 and the same such revenue generated in November 2023, for customers with a start date prior to December 1, 2023 and no end date or cancelled relationship on or after November 1, 2024. For cancelled customers, we examine customers that cancelled their relationships on or after the first day of the month that is 12 months prior to the current month and 
II-4
before the first day of the current month. For example, the recurring or reoccurring revenue lost from cancelled customers in November 2024 is the difference between the recurring or re-occurring revenue generated in November 2024 and the same such revenue generated in November 2023, for customers that cancelled on or after November 1, 2023 and before November 1, 2024. The annualized pro forma net revenue retention is calculated as the annualized net revenue retention rate adjusted as though acquisitions and dispositions that were closed during the prior period presented were closed on the first day of such period presented. Our annualized net revenue retention rate and pro forma net revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the growing level of our revenue base, the level of penetration within our customer base, expansion of solutions, new acquisitions and dispositions and our ability to retain our customers. Our calculation of annualized net revenue retention rate and annualized pro forma net revenue retention rate may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies.
This rate for any fiscal period includes the positive recurring and re-occurring revenue impacts of selling new solutions to existing customers and the negative impacts of contraction and attrition among this set of customers. Our net pro forma revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the growing level of our revenue base, the level of penetration within our customer base, expansion of solutions, new acquisitions and our ability to retain our customers. Our calculation of net pro forma revenue retention rate may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies.
Impact of Macroeconomic Climate
The macroeconomic climate has seen in the recent years, and may continue to see, pressure from global developments such as international geopolitical conflicts, increased tariffs and proposed tariffs between the United States and other nations, terrorism, pandemics or health crises, rising inflation, fluctuations in the value of the US Dollar, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. These developments have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and demand for our products and services, as well as on our costs of doing business. We have taken and will continue to take actions to help mitigate the impact of these economic challenges, but there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts going forward.
Sale of Fitness Solutions 
On March 13, 2024, we entered into definitive sale and purchase agreements to sell our fitness solutions, comprised of North American Fitness and UK Fitness (“Fitness Solutions”), to Jonas Software (see
 Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The sale of North American Fitness closed simultaneously with signing and the sale of UK Fitness closed July 1, 2024. The divestiture did not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation and therefore, its results were included in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K through the applicable date of sale. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized losses of $
4.9
 million related to the sale of Fitness Solutions, which are included in loss on sale and impairments on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $
6.4
 million of goodwill impairment charges representing the allocated goodwill to Fitness Solutions, which is included in loss on sale and impairments on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges. 
Acquiring New Customers
Sustaining our growth requires continued adoption of our solutions by new customers. Through organic growth of our business, the number of customers on our platform increased to approximately 740,000 at the end of 2024. Excluding the customers associated with the sale of our fitness assets, we served more than 690,000 customers at the end of 2023 (
see Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We will continue to invest in our efficient go-to-market strategy as we further penetrate our addressable markets. Our financial performance will depend in large part on the overall demand for our solutions from service SMBs.
Expand Revenue and Margin from Existing Customers
We believe we have the opportunity to drive incremental revenue growth from our existing customer base through increased cross-selling and up-selling adjacent solutions. Our integrated SaaS solutions allow us to offer customers additional capabilities across their entire customer engagement lifecycle including digital payments, customer engagement and marketing technology. As we continue to develop, acquire and transform our solutions, we aim to continue adding value to our customers by displacing point-solution competitors and legacy, manual methods with our integrated digital offerings, increasing our revenue and improving customer experience and retention. A primary focus for revenue expansion focuses on cross-selling payments solutions to customers in an effort to prioritize margin growth. We also generate subscription and marketing technology revenue from cross-selling our Customer 
II-5
Engagement and Marketing Technology Solutions across our customer base. These solutions increase customer loyalty, repeat purchases, improve customer experiences and help businesses to manage campaigns and generate quality leads.
Expanding into New Products and Micro-Verticals
Given our position in the service SMB ecosystem, as well as our relationships and level of engagement with our customers, we use insights gained through our customer relationships and lifecycle to identify additional solutions that are value-additive for our customers. These insights allow us to continually assess opportunities to develop or acquire solutions to further grow our business by expanding market share, cross-selling solutions and enhancing customer stickiness to improve customer retention. Additionally, we have completed acquisitions to enter new micro-verticals and geographies.
Continued Investment in Growth
We continue to drive awareness and generate demand for our solutions in order to acquire new customers and develop new service SMB relationships, as we believe that we still have a significant market opportunity ahead of us. We will continue to expand efforts to market our solutions directly to SMBs through online digital marketing, raising brand awareness at conferences and events, and other marketing channels. We believe this investment, coupled with our attractive unit economics, will enable us to grow our customer base and continue our strategy of profitable growth.
We intend to increase our investment in our solutions to maintain our position as a leading provider of integrated SaaS solutions for service SMBs. To drive adoption and increase penetration within our base, we will continue to introduce new features and upgrade our technology solutions. We believe that investment in technology development will contribute to our long-term growth, but may also negatively impact our short-term profitability.
In 2024, we continued to invest in scalable operations, including vertical market leadership, and necessary functions to support operating as a public company, including Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Additionally, we continued to evaluate our suite of solutions and strategic options to drive investment in our highest growth solutions while simplifying our business to align with our transformation initiatives, including the divestiture of Fitness Solutions. In 2025 and beyond, incremental investments will be needed to support the ongoing transformation of our business and infrastructure, including Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. As part of our transformation initiatives, we expect to continue to evaluate our suite of solutions and may pursue dispositions of non-core assets and other strategic transactions. In March 2025, the Company announced the evaluation of strategic alternatives for our Marketing Technology Solutions with an expectation of a probable disposition by sale in 2025. The Company expects to reflect Marketing Technology Solutions as discontinued operations beginning with its first quarter 2025 financial reporting.
We acquire companies to accelerate our position as a market leader, fill gaps within our vertically tailored solutions, deepen our competitive moats in existing verticals and enter new verticals and geographies. We have acquired 53 companies since our inception, the majority of which were completed prior to 2022. While our pace of acquisition has slowed, we continue to pursue growth through a mix of organic revenue expansion and acquisitions. We have an established framework for identification, execution, integration and onboarding of targets, which leverages our significant acquisition experience and utilizes internal criteria for evaluating acquisition candidates and prospective businesses. These acquired solutions can bring deep industry expertise and vertically-tailored software solutions that provide additional sources of growth. We believe that our methodology, track record and reputation for sourcing, evaluating and integrating acquisitions positions us as an “acquirer-of-choice” for potential targets.
Although we expect to continue to acquire companies and other assets in the future, such acquisitions pose a number of challenges and risks. For additional information, see Part I. Item 1A. 
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our recent growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth,”

“—We may be unsuccessful in achieving our objectives through acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions” and “—Revenues and profits generated through acquisitions may be less than anticipated, and we may fail to uncover all liabilities of acquisition targets through the due diligence process prior to an acquisition, resulting in unanticipated costs, losses or a decline in profits, as well as potential impairment charges. Claims against us relating to any acquisition may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller’s indemnification obligations.”
Key Business and Financial Metrics
In addition to our results and measures of performance determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we believe the following key business and non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating and comparing our financial and operational performance over multiple periods, identifying trends affecting our business, formulating business plans and making strategic decisions.
II-6
Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate
Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our consolidated operating performance from continuing operations over time. Management also uses this metric for planning and forecasting purposes.
Our year-over-year Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate is calculated as though all acquisitions and divestitures completed as of the end of the latest period were closed as of the first day of the prior year period presented. In calculating Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate, we add the revenue from acquisitions for the reporting periods prior to the date of acquisition (including estimated purchase accounting adjustments) and exclude revenue from divestitures for the reporting periods prior to the date of divestiture, and then calculate our revenue growth rate between the two reported periods. As a result, Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate includes pro forma revenue from businesses acquired and excludes revenue from businesses divested during the period, including revenue generated during periods when we did not yet own the acquired businesses and excludes revenue prior to the divestiture of the business. In including such pre-acquisition revenue and excluding pre-divestiture revenue, Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate allows us to measure the underlying revenue growth of our business as it stands as of the end of the respective period, which we believe provides insight into our then-current operations. Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate does not represent organic revenue generated by our business as it stood at the beginning of the respective period. Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rates are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or actual results that might have been achieved had the acquisitions and divestitures been consummated on the first day of the prior year period presented. We believe that this metric is useful to investors in analyzing our financial and operational performance period over period and evaluating the growth of our business, normalizing for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. This metric is particularly useful to management due to the number of acquired entities.
Our Revenue Growth Rate was 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Total revenues include post-acquisition revenue from Kickserv, which was acquired August 10, 2023 (see
 Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), of $3.0 million and $1.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, total revenues include pre-divestiture revenue from Fitness Solutions, which was divested in 2024 (see
 Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), of $8.1 million and $23.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Pro Forma Revenue Growth rate was 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflective of the underlying growth in our business as a result of new customers and providing more solutions to existing customers.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Gross Profit
Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), amortization of developed technology, amortization of capitalized software and depreciation expense (allocated to cost of revenues). We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted to exclude non-cash charges of depreciation and amortization allocated to cost of revenues.
Adjusted Gross Profit is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operational performance, as it represents the results of revenues and direct costs, which are key components of our operations. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it reflects the gross profitability of our operations, and excludes the indirect costs associated with our sales and marketing, product development, general and administrative activities and depreciation and amortization and the impact of our financing methods and income taxes. Adjusted Gross Profit should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other GAAP measures of income (loss) or profitability.
The following table presents a reconciliation of gross profit, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted Gross Profit on a consolidated basis.

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net loss adjusted to exclude interest and other expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, other amortization, stock-based compensation expense and transaction-related and other non-recurring or unusual costs. Other amortization includes amortization for capitalized contract acquisition costs. Transaction-related costs are specific deal-related costs such as legal fees, financial and tax due diligence, consulting and escrow fees. Other non-recurring or unusual costs are expenses such as impairment charges, (gains) losses from divestitures, system implementation costs, executive separation costs, severance expense related to planned restructuring activities, and costs associated with integration and transformational improvements. Transaction-related and other non-recurring or unusual costs are excluded as they are not representative of our underlying operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our financial performance and is also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it provides a comparable overview of our operations across historical periods. In addition, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different tax rates and/or different forms of employee compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management team as an additional measure of our performance for purposes of business decision-making, including managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help our management identify additional trends in our financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees. Our Management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other GAAP measures of income (loss).

Description of Certain Components of Financial Data
For additional information concerning our accounting policies, see 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenues
We derive our revenue from three primary sources which are described in detail below: (i) Subscription and Transaction Fees, which are primarily recurring revenue streams, (ii) Marketing Technology Solutions, which includes both recurring and re-occurring revenue streams and (iii) Other revenue, which consists primarily of the sale of distinct professional services and hardware. Our revenue recognition policies are discussed in more detail under 
“Critical Accounting Estimates.”
Subscription and Transaction Fees
: Revenue includes (i) recurring monthly, quarterly and annual SaaS subscriptions and software license and maintenance fees from the sale of our Business Management, Customer Engagement and Billing and Payment solutions; (ii) payment processing fees based on the transaction volumes processed through our integrated payment solutions, and processing fees based on transaction volumes for our revenue cycle management, chronic care management and health insurance clearinghouse solutions; and (iii) membership subscriptions and our share of rebates from suppliers generated though group purchasing programs. Our revenue from payment processing fees is recorded net of credit card and ACH processing and interchange charges in the month the services are performed.
Marketing Technology Solutions:
 Revenue includes (i) recurring revenues for managing digital advertising programs on behalf of our customers including website hosting, search engine management and optimization, social media management and blog automation; and (ii) re-occurring fees paid by service professionals for consumer leads generated by our various platforms.
Other
: Revenue includes (i) consulting, implementation, training and other professional services; (ii) website development; (iii) revenue from various business development partnerships; (iv) event income; and (v) hardware sales related to our business management or payment software solutions. 
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consists of expenses related to delivering our services and products and providing support to our customers and includes employee costs and related overhead, customer credit card processing fees, targeted mail costs, third party fulfillment costs and software hosting expenses.
We expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from period to period based on a variety of factors, including the mix of revenue between Subscription and Transaction Fees and Marketing Technology Solutions, labor costs, third-party expenses and acquisitions. In particular, Marketing Technology Solutions revenue generally has a higher cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue than our subscription and transaction fee revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue from subscription and transaction fees increased 5.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, whereas Marketing Technology Solutions revenue decreased 2.9%. To the extent our Marketing Technology Solutions revenue grows at a faster rate, whether by acquisition or otherwise, than our Subscription and Transaction Fees revenue, it could negatively impact our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee costs for our sales and marketing personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and sales commissions. Sales and marketing expenses also include advertising costs, travel-related expenses and costs to market and promote our products, direct customer acquisition costs, costs related to conferences and events and partner/broker commissions. Software and subscription services dedicated for use by our sales and marketing organization, and outside services contracted for sales and marketing purposes are also included in sales and marketing expense. Sales commissions that are incremental to obtaining a customer contract are deferred and amortized ratably over the estimated period of our relationship with that customer. We expect our sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase investments to support our growth.
Product Development
Product development expense consists primarily of employee costs for our product development personnel, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses. Product development expenses also include third-party outsourced technology costs incurred in developing our platforms, and computer equipment, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our product development organization. We expect our product development expenses from continuing operations to increase in absolute dollars and increase as a percentage of revenue during 2025 as we continue to dedicate substantial resources to develop, improve and expand the functionality of our solutions.
II-9
General and Administrative 
General and administrative expense consists of employee costs for our executive leadership, accounting, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses also include external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, rent, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our general and administrative employees and other general corporate expenses. We expect general and administrative expense from continuing operations to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future due to costs as a result of being a public company. As we are able to further scale our operations in the future, we would expect that general and administrative expenses would decrease as a percentage of revenue.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization primarily relate to intangible assets, property and equipment and capitalized software.
Loss on Sale and Impairments
Loss on sale relates to the divestiture of Fitness Solutions. Impairments include goodwill impairment charges and operating lease impairments related to the Company’s decision to cease use of certain leased premises and sublease certain facilities.
Interest and Other Expense, net
Interest and other expense, net, primarily consists of interest expense on long-term debt, net of interest income. It also includes amortization expense of financing costs and discounts, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses related to interest rate swap agreements.
Income Tax (Expense) Benefit
U.S. GAAP requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities, computed at the expected tax rates for the periods in which the assets or liabilities will be realized, as well as for the expected tax (expense) benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable by the Company's corporate subsidiaries for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes.

While revenue growth remains a key focus, we remain committed to continued expansion of gross margin, net income and Adjusted EBITDA through ongoing transformation initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenues declined from 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an improvement of approximately 150 basis points resulting in higher gross margin. Additionally, the combination of cost of revenue, sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative costs declined from 83.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 81.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an improvement of approximately 170 basis points. A discussion on primary drivers of cost reductions resulting in improved margin follows in the subsequent sections.

Revenues increased $23.4 million, or 3.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

The growth of revenue from subscription and transaction fees was 5.4% during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year period, while the changes in marketing technology solutions and other revenues experienced more volatility in revenue generation than the delivery of services through our system of actions. The majority of our revenue growth is attributable to the successful delivery of system of action capabilities to our SMBs in our verticals of home services, health and wellness. The subscription and transaction revenue increases during the year ended December 31, 2024 consist primarily of increases from (a) business management software and (b) billing and payment solutions. Business management software revenues drove a $24.8 million increase in subscription and transaction revenues due to an expansion in our number of customers, certain price increases across our portfolio, and an increase in rebate revenue from contracted suppliers due to growth of membership subscriptions in group purchasing programs. Billing and payment solutions revenues drove an increase of $3.3 million, which was primarily due to higher transaction volumes processed through our payment platforms, partially offset by lower revenue in 2024 due to the Fitness Solutions divestiture. Subscription and transaction revenues also include $3.0 million and $1.0 million of post-acquisition revenue from Kickserv for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and pre-divestiture revenue from Fitness Solutions of $8.0 million and $23.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively (see 
Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Marketing technology solutions revenues decreased $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, 
II-12
which was primarily due to a reduction in demand driven by decreases in consumer spending, partially offset by certain price increases and customer growth related to lead generation services. Other revenues decreased $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 driven by revenue related to project implementation and customer development services which did not recur in the current year.

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $15.4 million, or 14.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The reduction in depreciation and amortization was driven primarily by the reduced rate of replacement assets resulting from a slowdown in business acquisitions. Specifically, the decrease was driven primarily by $16.3 million in lower intangible assets’ amortization and a decrease of $0.8 million of property and equipment depreciation, partially offset by $1.8 million of additional capitalized software amortization.

During the fourth quarter 2024, in conjunction with our review of strategic alternatives for our Marketing Technology Solutions, we evaluated the recoverability of our marketing technology reporting unit and determined that the estimated fair value was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the reporting unit resulting in an impairment of goodwill of approximately $28.1 million (see 
Note 20. Subsequent Event
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

In March 2024, we entered into definitive sale and purchase agreements to sell our Fitness Solutions (see 
Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized losses of $4.9 million related to the sale of Fitness Solutions and $6.4 million of goodwill impairment charges representing the allocated goodwill to Fitness Solutions. During the fourth quarter 2023, we determined that the estimated fair value of our fitness asset group was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the asset group resulting in an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $5.1 million
. 
Additionally, we ceased use of certain leased premises and subleased certain facilities resulting in an impairment charge of $0.4 million and $1.2 million to impair the right-of-use lease assets to their fair value during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2024 was driven primarily by an unrealized gain of $6.4 million on interest rate swaps, as compared to an unrealized loss of $2.0 million in the comparative period, a $2.1 million increase in interest income, and a decrease of $1.9 million in interest expense as a result of lower variable base interest rates on the Company’s Credit Facilities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, our primary sources of liquidity have been net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from equity issuances and proceeds from long-term debt.
We utilize liquidity for items such as strategic investments in the ongoing transformation of our business and infrastructure, our business acquisitions (such as Kickserv) and share repurchases authorized through our Repurchase Program. For a description of our recent acquisitions, see 
Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Absent significant deterioration of market conditions, we expect that working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the Company’s Repurchase Program (as defined below), debt servicing and lease obligations will be our principal needs for liquidity going forward.
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $135.8 million, $190.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our Revolver (as defined below) and $532.1 million outstanding under our Term Loan (as defined below). We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, availability under our Credit Facilities, and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures, and to service our debt obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and size of future acquisitions, and the timing of introductions of new products and services. If needed, additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A
.“Risk Factors.”

Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $113.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $104.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Changes in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from cash received from net sales within our subscription and transaction fees and marketing technology solutions. Other drivers of the changes in net cash provided by operating activities include payments for personnel expenses for our employees, costs related to delivering our services and products, partner commissions, advertising and interest on our long-term debt. 
The increase in cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in cash collections from our subscription and transaction fees and marketing technology solutions, which includes revenues from payment processing of approximately $28.0 million and higher interest income of $2.0 million, partially offset by 
II-15
investments made to support the growth of our business including personnel expenses of $13.8 million, an increase in costs directly related to the delivery of our services and products of $7.0 million, and an increase in taxes of $1.4 million.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of $12.3 million was related primarily to costs to develop software of $17.4 million and $1.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of Fitness Solutions, net of transaction costs, cash and restricted cash sold for approximately $6.6 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of $38.0 million was related primarily to costs to develop software of $20.0 million, the acquisition of Kickserv, net of cash acquired, for approximately $15.0 million and $3.0 million for purchases of property and equipment.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities of $59.6 million was related primarily to the repurchase and retirement of shares of our common stock of $57.7 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities of $66.6 million was related primarily to the repurchase and retirement of shares of our common stock of $67.3 million. 
For additional information regarding our repurchase and retirement of shares of our common stock, refer to 
Note 11. Equity
 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Credit Facilities
We are party to a credit agreement, as amended, that provides for one term loan for an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million (“Term Loan”), a revolver with a capacity of $190.0 million (“Revolver”) and a sub-limit of the Revolver available for letters of credit up to an aggregate face amount of $20.0 million. These debt arrangements are collectively referred to herein as the “Credit Facilities”.
Simultaneously with the execution of the Credit Facilities, we and various of our subsidiaries entered into a collateral agreement and guarantee agreement. Pursuant to the guarantee agreement, EverCommerce Intermediate Inc. and various of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the obligations under the Credit Facilities. Pursuant to the collateral agreement, the Credit Facilities are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property and the equity interests of our various subsidiaries, including EverCommerce Solutions Inc.
The Credit Facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, issuance of preferred equity interests, liens, fundamental changes and asset sales, investments, negative pledges, repurchases of stock, dividends and other distributions, and transactions with affiliates. In addition, we are subject to a financial covenant with respect to the Revolver whereby, if the aggregate principal amount of revolving loans (excluding letters of credit) outstanding on the last day of any fiscal quarter exceeds 35% of the aggregate commitments available under the Revolver, then our first lien leverage ratio as of the last day of such fiscal quarter must be 7.50 to 1.00 or less.
With respect to ABR borrowings, interest payments are due on a quarterly basis on the last business day of each March, June, September and December. With respect to Eurocurrency borrowings, interest payments are due on the last business day of the interest period applicable to the borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency borrowing with an interest period of more than three months’ duration, each day prior to the last day of such interest period that occurs at intervals of three months’ duration after the first day of such interest period. 
Effective as of July 1, 2023, borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at the Company’s option at ABR plus an applicable rate, or at a forward-looking term rate based upon the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus (i) (a) with respect to the Term Loan, credit spread adjustments of 0.11448%, 0.26161%, 0.42826% and 0.71513% for interest periods of one, three, six and twelve months, respectively, and (b) with respect to revolving loans, a credit spread adjustment of 0.0% (“Adjusted SOFR”) plus (ii) an applicable rate, in each case with such applicable rate based on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio. The ABR represents the highest of the prime rate, Federal Reserve Bank of New York rate plus ½ of 1%, and the Adjusted SOFR for a one month interest period plus 1%. The applicable rate for the Term Loan and the Revolver was 3.0% for Adjusted SOFR borrowings and 2.0% for ABR borrowings, in each case subject to change based on our first lien net leverage ratio.
On December 13, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Facilities to reduce the applicable margin and remove the credit spread adjustment from the existing Term Loan in their entirety in an aggregate principal amount of $533.5 million. Following the Amendment, the Term Loan bears interest, at the borrower’s election, at (x) a forward-looking term rate based upon SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.50%, with a minimum forward-looking SOFR rate 0.50% or (y) ABR plus an 
II-16
applicable margin of 1.50%, with a minimum ABR of 1.50%, in each case, with no step-downs. The credit spread adjustment was removed in connection with the Amendment. The refinanced Term Loan priced at par and refinanced all of the existing term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to giving effect to the Amendment.
Beginning in late 2022, we executed a series of three interest rate swaps (for total notional amounts of $425 million) to convert a portion of the floating rate component of our Term Loan to a fixed rate. Effective October 31, 2022, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in connection with the Company’s Credit Facilities for a notional amount of $200.0 million (the “Initial Swap”). The Initial Swap has a term of five years with a fixed rate in the agreement of 4.212% as amended in June 2023. Additionally, effective March 31, 2023, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement in connection with our Credit Facilities for a notional amount of $100.0 million (the “Second Swap”). The Second Swap has a term of approximately 4.5 years with a fixed rate in the agreement of 3.951%, as amended in June 2023. Additionally, effective September 20, 2024, the Company entered into a third interest rate swap agreement in connection with our Credit Facilities for a notional amount of $125.0 million (the “Third Swap”). The Third Swap has a term of approximately 3.0 years with a fixed rate in the agreement of 3.395%.
The Revolver has a variable commitment fee, which is based on our first lien leverage ratio. We expect the commitment fee to range from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum. We are obligated to pay a fixed fronting fee for letters of credit of 0.125% per annum.
Amounts borrowed under the Revolver may be repaid and re-borrowed through maturity of the Revolver in July 2026. The Term Loans mature in July 2028. The Term Loan may be repaid or prepaid but may not be re-borrowed.
As of December 31, 2024, there was $532.1 million outstanding under our Credit Facilities, all of which was related to the Term Loan as no amounts were outstanding under the Revolver. The effective interest rate on the Term Loan was approximately 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024, excluding the effect of any interest rate swap agreements.
As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Facilities.
Stock Repurchase Program
On June 14, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program (as subsequently amended, the “Repurchase Program”) with authorization to purchase up to $50.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock through the expiration of the program on December 21, 2022. On November 7, 2022, November 5, 2023, and May 21, 2024, our Board increased the authorization of the Repurchase Program by an additional $50.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock on each date for a total authorization to repurchase up to $200.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock, and most recently extended the expiration of the Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at the Company’s discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of the Board. The Company expects to fund repurchases with existing cash on hand.
The Company repurchased and retired 5.7 million shares of common stock for $57.7 million, including transaction fees and taxes, during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, $32.7 million remains available under the Repurchase Program.
Contractual Obligations
Refer to 
Notes 9. Leases, 10. Long-Term Debt and 17. Commitments and Contingencies
 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our operating lease, debt and contractual obligations, respectively.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. 
While our significant accounting policies are described in further detail in 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are derived from subscription and transaction fees, marketing technology solutions, and other revenues. We recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive 
II-17
in exchange for those goods or services. In determining the total consideration that we expect to receive, we include variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. There have not been any material changes during 2024 in the underlying estimates and assumptions in determining probability of variable consideration.
Subscription and Transaction Fees:
Subscription revenue primarily consists of the sale of SaaS offerings, software licenses and related support services and payment processing services.
The timing of revenue recognition within our software subscription services is dictated by the nature of the underlying performance obligation. SaaS offerings and license support services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to customers, while on-premise perpetual or term licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download or use. Subscription revenue-related contracts can be both short and long-term, with stated contract terms that range from one month to five years. Our contracts may contain termination for convenience provisions that allow the Company, customer or both parties the ability to terminate for convenience, either at any time or upon providing a specified notice period, without a penalty.
Transaction fees relate to payment processing and group purchasing program administration services. In fulfillment of our payment processing services, we partner with third-party merchants and processors who assist us in fulfillment of our obligations to customers. We have concluded that we do not possess the ability to control the underlying services provided by third parties in the fulfillment of our obligations to customers and therefore recognize revenue net of interchange fees retained by the card issuing financial institutions and fees charged by payment networks. Transaction services contracts with customers are generally for a term of one month and automatically renew each month.
We also receive rebates from contracted suppliers in exchange for our program administration services. Rebates earned are based on a defined percentage of the purchase price of goods and services sold to members. Administration services contracts with customers are generally for an annual or monthly term and renew automatically upon lapse of the current term.
Marketing Technology Solutions:
Marketing technology solutions consist of digital advertising management and consumer connection services.
Revenue generated from digital advertising management services is recognized on a ratable basis over the service period as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the management services evenly throughout the contract period. Revenue generated from consumer connection services may be recognized at either a point-in-time or an over-time basis as each connection is delivered.
Marketing technology solutions service related contracts are typically short-term with stated contract terms that are less than one year.
Other:
Other revenues generally consist of fees associated with the sale of distinct professional services and hardware. Contract terms for other revenue arrangements are generally short-term, with stated contract terms that are less than one year.
Our professional services associated with our subscription revenue generally relate to standard implementation, configuration, installation, or training services applied to both SaaS and on-premise deployment models. Marketing revenue related professional service fees are derived from website design, creation or enhancement services. Professional service revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services.
Performance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price:
Our contracts at times include the sale of multiple promised goods or services that have been determined to be distinct. The transaction price for contracts with multiple performance obligations is allocated based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation within the contract.
Judgement can be involved when determining the stand-alone selling price of products and services. For the majority of the Company’s SaaS, on-premise license and professional services, we establish a stand-alone selling price based on observable selling prices to similar classes of customers. If the stand-alone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into consideration available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligation. As permitted under ASC 606, at times we have established the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations as a range and utilize this range to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative stand-alone selling price of the various performance obligations.
II-18
At contract inception, we perform a review of each performance obligation’s selling price against the established stand-alone selling price range. If any performance obligations are priced outside of the established stand-alone selling price range, we reallocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price for each performance. The established range is reassessed on a periodic basis when facts and circumstances surrounding these established ranges change.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Recoverability
We perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be fully recoverable. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test or may elect to proceed directly to a quantitative goodwill impairment test. For the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company performed a quantitative assessment, which resulted in substantial excess of estimated fair value over net carrying value for each reporting unit. The qualitative annual impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2024 excluded the marketing technology reporting unit as discussed below. For the quantitative assessment, we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. As part of the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. For the qualitative assessments, we reviewed factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in any key personnel, any changes in composition of carrying amount of our assets and changes in our stock price. There were no reasonable changes to the methods and assumptions that would have resulted in an impairment. In the future, if there are material changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions pertaining to the impairment assessment, the financial statements could be materially impacted. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was more than the respective related carrying amounts, including goodwill, and therefore did not record any goodwill impairment.
The Company performed a qualitative annual impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, which resulted in substantial excess of estimated fair value over net carrying value for each reporting unit, except for the marketing technology reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2024 as further described below. As a result of this qualitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2024, we performed a further quantitative evaluation for the marketing technology reporting unit.
During the fourth quarter 2024, in conjunction with our review of strategic alternatives for our Marketing Technology Solutions, and as a result of lower than expected financial performance and future forecasted growth rates we determined that the estimated fair value of our marketing technology reporting unit was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the reporting unit resulting in an impairment of goodwill of approximately $28.1 million (see 
Note 20. Subsequent Event
 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

In connection with the definitive sale and purchase agreements to sell our fitness solutions, we tested the goodwill balance for impairment as of March 31, 2024 and recognized a goodwill impairment of $6.4 million representing the allocated goodwill for Fitness Solutions (see 
Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Indicators we reviewed included whether there was a significant decrease in market prices of our assets, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which our assets are being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors affecting our assets and a cash flow loss. During the fourth quarter 2023, we determined that the estimated fair value of our fitness asset group was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the asset group resulting in an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $5.1 million, of which $3.1 million was attributable to intangible assets.

The Company did not identify indicators of impairment for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the future, if there are material changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions pertaining to the impairment assessment, the financial statements could be materially impacted.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the net tax effect of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income or loss in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed. A valuation allowance is used to reduce some or all of the deferred tax assets if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any.
II-19
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
The Company recorded an additional $13.0 million and $4.1 million in valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in 2024 and 2023, respectively, using the aforementioned approach. The Company recorded $0.1 million and $0.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Valuation allowances are currently assessed based on scheduling the reversal of temporary differences, without consideration to future projections of income, given the Company’s history of losses. This approach may change in the future, requiring the use of estimates or assumptions with regard to future taxable income in assessing the need for and quantum of valuation allowances.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting pronouncements recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted and their potential impact to our financial statements.
Election Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
The Company currently qualifies as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Accordingly, the Company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting guidance either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies.
The Company has elected to adopt new or revised accounting guidance within the same time period as private companies, unless management determines it is preferable to take advantage of early adoption provisions offered within the applicable guidance. Our utilization of these transition periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the transition periods afforded under the JOBS Act.
II-20
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange risk. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Interest rate risk
We hold cash and cash equivalents for working capital purposes. We do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments. We have mitigated a majority of our market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which cover $425.0 million of our $532.1 million outstanding under our Term Loan as of December 31, 2024. Following an amendment in December 2024, the Term Loan bears interest, at the borrower’s election, at (x) a forward-looking term rate based upon SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.50%, with a minimum forward-looking SOFR rate 0.50% or (y) ABR plus an applicable margin of 1.50%, with a minimum ABR of 1.50%, in each case, with no step-downs. As of December 31, 2024, we had no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Loan.
Beginning in late 2022, we executed a series of three interest rate swaps (for total notional amounts of $425 million) to convert a portion of the floating rate component of our Term Loan to a fixed rate. Effective October 31, 2022, the Company entered into the Initial Swap in connection with the Company’s Credit Facilities for a notional amount of $200.0 million. The Initial Swap has a term of five years with a fixed rate in the agreement of 4.2120%, as amended in June 2023. Additionally, effective March 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Swap in connection with the Company’s Credit Facilities for a notional amount of $100.00 million. The Second Swap agreement has a term of approximately 4.5 years with a fixed rate in the agreement of 3.951%, as amended in June 2023. On September 20, 2024, the Company entered into a Third Swap in connection with the Company’s Credit Facilities for a notional amount of $125.0 million. The Third Swap agreement has a term of approximately 3.0 years with a fixed rate in the agreement of 3.395%.
Based on the outstanding balance of the Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2024, for every 100 basis point increase in the Adjusted SOFR rate, we would incur approximately $1.1 million of additional annual interest expense. 
Foreign currency exchange risk
We have foreign currency risks related to certain of our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in Canada, Jordan, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. The functional currencies of our significant foreign operations include the Canadian dollar, Great British pound, Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar. We do not believe that a 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other foreign currencies would have a material effect on our cash flows and operating results.
We currently do not hedge foreign currency exposure. We may in the future hedge our foreign currency exposure and may use currency forward contracts, currency options or other common derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency risk. It is difficult to predict the effect that future hedging activities would have on our operating results.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of EverCommerce Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EverCommerce Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Nature of the Business
EverCommerce Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company” or “EverCommerce”) is a leading provider of integrated software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions or services for service based small and medium sized businesses (“service SMBs”). Our platforms span across the full lifecycle of interactions between consumers and service professionals with vertical-specific applications. As of December 31, 2024, the Company served more than 
740,000
 customers across 
three
 core verticals: EverPro for Home Services; EverHealth for Health Services; and EverWell for Wellness Services. Within the core verticals, customers operate within numerous micro-verticals, ranging from home service professionals, such as construction contractors and home maintenance technicians, to physician practices and therapists in the Health Services industry, to salon owners in the Wellness sectors. The platform provides vertically-tailored SaaS solutions that address service SMBs’ increasingly nuanced demands, as well as highly complementary solutions that provide fully-integrated offerings, allowing service SMBs and EverCommerce to succeed in the market, and provide end consumers more convenient service experiences. The Company is headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and has operations across the United States, Canada, Jordan, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements (collectively, the “financial statements”) include the operations of EverCommerce and all wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
On March 13, 2024, the Company entered into definitive sale and purchase agreements to sell our fitness solutions to Jonas Fitness Portfolio Holdco Inc. (“Jonas Software”) (see Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions). The sale of American Service Finance LLC., ASF Payment Solutions ULC and Technique Fitness Inc. (collectively, “North American Fitness”), closed simultaneous with signing. The sale of EverCommerce UK, including wholly-owned subsidiaries Fitii UK (MyPTHub and MyPTHub LLC) and ClubWise UK and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClubWise Australia (collectively, “UK Fitness” and together with North American Fitness, “Fitness Solutions”), closed on July 1, 2024. The divestiture did not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. As a result, our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of North American Fitness and UK Fitness for all periods through the applicable date of sale.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are subject to uncertainties due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. Significant items subject to such estimates include: valuing identified intangible assets and acquired goodwill and establishing estimated useful lives for intangible assets in connection with business combinations; the estimation of the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets; income tax uncertainties, including valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and value of any uncertain tax positions; recognizing bad debt expense from expected credit losses; recognizing stock-based compensation expens
e
 and estimating standalone selling price, when applicable, for the allocation of transaction price when multiple performance obligations are included in a contract with a customer.
We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and recognized revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Business Combinations
The results of a business acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition with the associated purchase price allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Based on the nature of the businesses that the Company acquires, goodwill arising from acquisitions typically consists of synergies with previously acquired businesses and economies of scale resulting from centralizing shared service functions. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.
II-28

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant judgments and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies.
Concentrations of Risk
The Company maintains cash accounts at domestic and foreign financial institutions. At times and for cash maintained at domestic institutions, certain account balances may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance coverage. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts, and management believes that the Company’s risk of loss is remote. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. 
Restricted cash consists of funds that are contractually restricted as to usage or withdrawal. Restricted cash relates to cash collected from our customers’ clients that will be remitted to our customers subsequent to period-end, generally within a time period no longer than one month.
Accounts Receivable, net 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the expected credit loss, management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the customers’ financial condition, the amount of receivables in dispute and customer paying patterns. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.
Property and Equipment, net 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment acquired in purchase accounting are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives. 
Property and Equipment
Estimated Useful Life
Computer equipment and software
3
 years
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term
Upon disposition, the cost of disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings/loss.
Capitalized Software, net
The Company capitalizes certain costs related to software developed for internal use for which it has no plans to market externally. Internal use software includes the software used for the Company’s SaaS offerings. The Company expenses the costs of developing computer software until the software has reached the application development stage and capitalizes all costs incurred from that time until the software has been placed in service, at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins. Determination of when the software has reached the application development stage is based upon completion of conceptual designs, evaluation of alternative designs and performance requirements. Costs of major enhancements to internal use software are capitalized while routine maintenance of existing software is charged to product development expense as incurred.
The Company also capitalizes certain costs related to software developed for external use for which it plans to sell to customers, i.e. on-premise software to be installed on customer computers at the customer site. Costs incurred prior to reaching technological feasibility are charged to product development expense as incurred. Capitalization ceases when the product is available for general release to the customers. Such costs have not been material. 
The Company amortizes software costs, using the straight-line method, over its estimated useful life of 
five years
.
II-29

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Intangible Assets, net 
Intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships which include government contracts, developed technology, trademarks and trade names and non-compete agreements, which are recorded at acquisition date fair value, less accumulated amortization. The Company determines the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows of the acquired assets. Developed technology, trademarks and trade names and non-compete agreements acquired through acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method and customer relationship intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using present value of future cash flows, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be consumed.

Long-Lived Assets 
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate or other appropriate measures of fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimates of expected future cash flows represent management’s best estimate based on currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions. Any impairment recognized is permanent and may not be restored.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company evaluated the recoverability of our fitness asset group. As a result of our evaluation, we determined that the estimated fair value of our fitness asset group was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the asset group resulting in an 
impairment charge
 of approximately $
5.1
 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023, of which $
3.1
 million related to intangible assets. Additionally, the Company ceased use of certain leased premises and subleased certain facilities resulting in an impairment charge of $
1.2
 million to impair the right-of-use lease assets to their fair value during the year ended December 31, 2023. The impairment charges are recorded in impairment expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022 other than the abandonment of certain features of its capitalized software as more fully described in Note 8. Capitalized Software.
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over amounts allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. The carrying value of goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company performs an annual impairment review of its goodwill balance during the fourth quarter or more frequently if business factors indicate. Prior to performing a quantitative evaluation, an assessment of qualitative factors may be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. In the event the Company determines that it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. Alternatively, the Company may perform a quantitative assessment for the annual review of recoverability rather than a qualitative assessment. If the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. During 2024, we recognized $
34.5
 million of goodwill impairment charges, which are included in loss on sale and impairments on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the fourth quarter of 2024, in conjunction with our review of strategic alternatives for our marketing technology solutions, the Company evaluated the recoverability of our marketing technology reporting unit. As a result of our evaluation, we determined that the estimated fair value of our marketing technology reporting unit was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the reporting unit resulting in an impairment charge of approximately $
28.1
 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 20. Subsequent Event). Additionally, we recognized $
6.4
 million of goodwill impairment charges representing the allocated goodwill to Fitness Solutions (see Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions). We did not incur any goodwill impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Leases
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, 
Leases
 (Topic 842) as of January 1, 2022 and recognized right-of-use (“ROU”) lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet representing the rights and obligations created by those leases and disclosed key information about leasing arrangements. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and is recorded to general and administrative expense on the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Operating ROU lease assets are included in other non-current assets and operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other and other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
II-30

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We do not recognize ROU lease assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. For all other leases, operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to, and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. We also consider whether our service arrangements include the right to control the use of an asset. The ROU lease assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date and are adjusted for lease incentives. 
The Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate and we use our incremental borrowing rate to measure the lease liability and corresponding ROU lease assets. Our incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis adjusted for market conditions and the length of the lease term. Judgement is applied in assessing factors such as Company-specific credit risk, lease term, nature and quality of the underlying collateral, currency, and economic environment in determining the incremental borrowing rate to apply to each lease. 
The Company’s leases may include a non-lease component representing additional services transferred to the Company, such as common area maintenance for real estate. We elected the practical expedient to not separate lease from fixed non-lease components for our real estate leases. We account for the lease and fixed non-lease components of our operating ROU lease assets as a single lease component. The non-lease components are usually variable in nature and recorded in variable lease expense in the period incurred.
Future lease payments may include fixed rent escalation clauses or payments that depend on an index (such as the consumer price index) measured using the index or applicable rate at lease commencement. Subsequent changes in index and other periodic market-rate adjustments to base rent are recorded in variable lease expense in the period incurred. In addition, certain leases include options to extend or terminate a lease, which are recognized when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. The Company’s leases generally do not contain any material restrictive covenants or residual value guarantees.
The Company does not have any leases classified as finance leases.
Deferred Financing and Credit Facility Costs 
Deferred financing costs and discounts on long-term debt are capitalized and netted with long-term debt and amortized over the term of the related debt, using the effective interest method. Costs incurred in connection with the establishment of revolving credit facilities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related facility period, using the straight-line method. Amortization of debt issuance costs, noncash discounts and other credit facility costs are included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Revenue Recognition 
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company performs the following steps in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its contracts with customers: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when, or as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract to determine if they are distinct and represent a performance obligation. The Company then allocates the transaction price to the respective performance obligations, and recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services.
The Company maintains three primary categories of revenue sources:
Subscription and Transaction Fees:
Subscription revenue primarily consists of the sale of SaaS offerings or the sale of software licenses. Through the S
aaS offerings and related support services, customers are granted access to a hosted software application over the contract period, generally ranging from one month to five years, without a contractual right to possession of the software. Alternatively, through the sale of software licenses the customer is provided with a right to use software that provides functionality to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and related support services, which include telephone/technical support, when-and-if available software updates and, in certain instances, hosting services. The software licenses are both perpetual, providing the customer with the right-of-use for an indefinite period, and term, which generally range for a defined period of time from one month to five years. Contracts may contain termination for convenience provisions that allow the Company, customer or both parties the ability to terminate for convenience, either at any time or upon providing a specified notice period, without a penalty. The contract term for accounting purposes is determined to be the period in which parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations, therefore the contract term for accounting purposes may 
II-31

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
be shorter than the stated term. 
•
SaaS and related support services
: Revenues from the sale of hosted software applications and related support services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered, beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue is recognized ratably because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services throughout the contract period. Contracts are generally fixed price and may be invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, with standard payment terms ranging from due upon receipt to 30 days.
•
License and related support services:
 Revenues from the sale of distinct on-premise licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download or use. Revenues from the sale of license related support services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered. Within these arrangements, the Company is obligated to make the support services available continuously throughout the contract and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of making these services available throughout the contract period. Contracts are generally fixed price and may be invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, with standard payment terms ranging from due upon receipt to 30 days. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing customers due to the existence of these invoicing practices as well as the requirement to recognize revenue on a relative stand-alone selling price basis.
Transaction fees relate to payment processing and group purchasing program administration services. In fulfillment of payment processing services, the Company partners with third-party merchants and processors who assist in the fulfillment of the Company’s obligations to customers. Payment processing services enable customers to accept payments via credit card, electronic check and other similar methods through facilitation of payment information within the cloud-based applications. Group purchasing program administration services relate to facilitation of 
group purchasing programs for members through which the Company aggregates member purchasing power to negotiate pricing discounts with suppliers.
•
Payment processing services:
 The Company has concluded that it does not possess the ability to control the underlying services provided by third parties in the fulfillment of its obligations to customers and therefore recognizes revenue net of interchange fees retained by the card issuing financial institutions and fees charged by payment networks. The Company recognizes revenue from these transaction services as the services are provided and ascribes the transaction consideration to the distinct services utilizing the variable consideration allocation exception. Payment for transaction services is received in arrears, typically within one month of when the services have been provided. Transaction services contracts with customers are generally for a term of one month and renew automatically each month.
•
Purchasing program administration services: 
The Company receives rebates from contracted suppliers in exchange for program administration services. Rebates earned are based on a defined percentage of the purchase price of goods and services sold to program members under the contract the Company has negotiated with its suppliers. Administration services contracts with customers are generally for an annual or monthly term and renew automatically upon lapse of the current term.
Marketing Technology Solutions: 
Marketing technology solutions consist of digital advertising management and consumer connection services. Digital advertising management services include content creation, search engine optimization and paid media management services. The nature of the performance obligation within advertising management contracts is to stand-ready and provide management services on a continuous basis over the contract term. As a result, revenue associated with advertising management services is recognized on a ratable basis over the service period as 
the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the management services evenly throughout the contract period
. The Company typically earns a fixed recurring fee in exchange for advertising management services; however, in certain instances, the transaction consideration to which the Company is entitled may be variable. The Company applies the variable consideration allocation exception to these arrangements. Advertising management services are typically invoiced on a monthly basis either in arrears or in advance. Certain arrangements may be invoiced on a quarterly or annual basis.
Consumer connection services relate to the sourcing and delivery of service requests from consumers to home service providers. Revenue for consumer connection services may be recognized at either a point-in-time or on an over-time basis as each connection is delivered. Revenue is derived from fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches. Fees associated with each consumer match generated may be either fixed price or variable. The variable consideration, subject to being constrained by Company estimates, is allocated to the connection from which it was derived. Payment for consumer connection services is received in arrears, typically within one month of when the services have been provided. The Company records a contract asset or unbilled receivable for this difference on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketing technology solutions
 service related contracts are typically short-term with stated contract terms that are less than one year. 
II-32

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Other: 
Other revenues generally consist of fees associated with the sale of distinct professional services, either in support of subscription revenue or marketing technology revenue, and hardware. Professional service offerings are typically sold as part of an arrangement for products or services included within subscription or marketing revenue. Professional services associated with subscription revenue generally relate to standard implementation, configuration, installation or training services applied to both SaaS and on-premise deployment models and those services associated with marketing technology are derived from website design, creation or enhancement services. Professional service revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services. Professional service contracts are offered at either a fixed or a variable price and may be invoiced in advance or arrears of the services being provided.
Standard payment terms for these arrangements range from due upon receipt to 30 days. Contract terms for other revenue arrangements are generally short-term, with stated contract terms that are less than one year.
Performance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price:
The Company’s contracts at times include the sale of multiple promised goods or services that have been determined to be distinct. The transaction price for contracts with multiple performance obligations is allocated based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation within the contract. 
The Company’s contracts may include standard warranty or service level provisions that state promised goods and services will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements. The Company has determined that these represent assurance-type warranties, and the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such commitments.
Cost to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract:
The Company incurs certain costs to obtain contracts, principally sales, third-party commissions and third-party fulfillment fees, which the Company capitalizes when the liability has been incurred if they are (i) incremental costs of obtaining a contract, (ii) expected to be recovered and (iii) have an expected amortization period that is greater than one year (as the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense any costs to obtain a contract when the liability is incurred if the amortization period of such costs would be one year or less).
Material Rights:
The Company’s contracts with customers may include renewal or other options at stated prices. Determining whether these options provide the customer with a material right and therefore need to be accounted for as separate performance obligations requires judgment. The price of each option must be assessed to determine whether it is reflective of the stand-alone selling price or is reflective of a discount that the customer only received as a result of its prior purchase (a material right).
Other considerations:
The Company has elected a policy to exclude from the transaction price all sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities and as a result, revenue is presented net of tax.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of expenses related to delivering our services and products and providing support to our customers and includes employee costs and related overhead, customer credit card processing fees, targeted mail costs, third party fulfillment costs and software hosting expenses.

Advertising
We expense the cost of advertising as incurred, which is primarily for internet-based advertising to market our products and services.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, advertising expenses included in sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss were $
24.4
 million, $
23.7
 million and $
21.4
 million, respectively.
Stock-based Compensation
We measure stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards and recognize the compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted with time-based vesting and performance-based vesting terms, respectively, which requires the use of assumptions, including the fair value of the common stock, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock. The expected term represents the estimated average period of time that the option will remain outstanding using the “simplified” 
II-33

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
method that measures the expected term as the average of the vesting period and the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on history and the expectation of paying no dividends.
We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant and adjust these estimates to actual forfeitures as they occur. These assumptions involve inherent uncertainties including market conditions and employee behavior that are generally outside of the Company’s control. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest.
Income Taxes
The Company is a C corporation for federal income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company's total provision for taxes includes income taxes on the Company's corporate subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company accounts for GILTI as a period cost as incurred.
The Company records uncertain tax positions based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority when it is determined that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position. When applicable, interest and penalties relating to any such uncertain tax positions are recorded as part of income tax expense.
Comprehensive Loss 
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. The Company includes cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments in comprehensive loss as described below.
Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company computes basic net loss per share attributable to its common stockholders by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration of common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive shares of common stock are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is primarily the local currency in which the entity is located. The financial results of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate in effect as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets (the “Spot Rate”). Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. Translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity. The functional currencies of the Company’s significant foreign operations include the Canadian dollar, Great British Pound, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar.
For the Company’s subsidiaries that operate primarily in the U.S. dollar, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the Spot Rate in effect as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using historical exchange rates. Income and expense elements are remeasured at the average exchange rates during the respective periods in which the elements are recognized within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Emerging Growth Company
As an emerging growth company (“EGC”), the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) allows the Company to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are applicable to private companies. The Company has elected to use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date that it is (i) no longer an EGC or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting 
II-34

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
pronouncements as of public company effective dates. The adoption dates are discussed below to reflect this election within the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements section.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We evaluate all ASUs issued by the FASB for consideration of their applicability. ASUs not included in the disclosures in this report were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting pronouncements issued and adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting - Improving Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280)
. The update is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. The ASU requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM, an amount and description of the composition of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this ASU for the year ending December 31, 2024, which resulted in Note 19. Segment Reporting included within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
.

Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
2023 Acquisition
On August 10, 2023, the Company acquired 
100
% of the interest of Norman’s Dojo Inc. (“Kickserv”), a provider of field service management software for home service businesses for approximately $
15.0
 million in cash. The acquisition adds offerings for SMBs across diversified portfolios with an opportunity to capture a broader segment of new customers within the Home Services vertical.
We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
. Accordingly, the Company recorded identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date estimated fair values, with any excess consideration recognized as goodwill. Goodwill primarily represents the value associated with the assembled workforce and expected synergies subsumed into goodwill. The goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition of Kickserv is not deductible for tax purposes.
We measured the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date estimated fair values separately from goodwill, which represent Level 3 fair value measurements as defined in ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement
. The estimated fair values were determined by management using the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. The valuation methods used to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets included the income approach—relief from royalty method for developed technology with an estimated useful life of 
five years
, and the income approach—multi period excess earnings method for customer relationships with an estimated useful life of 
13
 years. A number of assumptions and estimates were involved in the application of these valuation methods, including revenue forecasts, expected competition, costs of revenues, obsolescence, tax rates, capital spending, customer attrition

rates, discount rates and working capital changes. Cash flow forecasts were generally based on pre-acquisition forecasts coupled with estimated revenues and cost synergies available to a market participant.
Each acquisition allows for an adjustment to the purchase price to be made subsequent to the transaction’s closing date based on the actual amount of working capital and cash delivered to the Company. The consideration paid and purchase price allocations disclosed reflect the effects of these adjustments.
The financial results of Kickserv since the closing through December 31, 2023, were not material to our consolidated financial statements, nor were they material to our prior period consolidated results on a pro forma basis.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized losses of $
4.9
 million, related to the sale of Fitness Solutions, which are included in loss on sale and impairments on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Additionally, the Company recognized $

Accounts receivable, net: 
Accounts receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, represent rights to consideration in exchange for products or services that have been transferred by us, when payment is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment is due. 
Contract assets: 
Contract assets represent rights to consideration in exchange for products or services that have been transferred (i.e., the performance obligation or portion of the performance obligation has been satisfied), but payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. These amounts typically relate to contracts with the suppliers within our 
group purchasing programs for which payment is received at least one quarter in arrears from the service period. They also relate to contracts that 
include on-premise licenses and professional services

where the right to payment is not present until completion of the contract or achievement of specified milestones and the fair value of products or services transferred exceed this constraint.
These amounts typically relate to contracts that include on-premise licenses and professional services where the right to payment is not present until completion of the contract or achievement of specified milestones and the fair value of products or services transferred exceed this constraint. 
Contract liabilities
: Contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, represent our obligation to transfer products or services to a customer for which consideration has been received in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. Long-term deferred revenue is included within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognized from the contract liability balance at December 31, 2023 was $
24.1
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Revenue recognized from the contract liability balance at December 31, 2022 was $
22.9

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations within contracts with an original expected contract term that is greater than one year for which fulfillment of the contract has started as of the end of the reporting period. Contracts that include 30-day termination rights are considered to be contracts with a term of one month 
II-37

and are therefore excluded from remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations generally relate to those which are stand-ready in nature, as found within the subscription and marketing technology solutions revenue streams. The aggregate amount of transaction consideration allocated to remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2024 was $
20.2
 million. The Company expects to recognize approximately 
60
% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue within the next year, 
29
% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue the subsequent year, 
9
% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue in the third year, and the remainder during the two-year period thereafter.
Cost to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract
Assets resulting from costs to obtain contracts are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets for short-term balances and other non-current assets for long-term balances on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The costs to obtain contracts are amortized over 
five years
, which corresponds with the useful life of the related technology. Short-term assets were $
10.2
 million and $
8.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and long-term assets were $
18.5

28.1
 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 20. Subsequent Event). Additionally, we recognized $

3.00
%  for Adjusted SOFR borrowings. See below for further details regarding the amendments to the Credit Facilities.
The Company is party to a credit agreement, as amended, that provides for 
one
 term loan for an aggregate principal amount of $
550.0
 million (the “Term Loan”), a revolver with a capacity of $
190.0
 million (the “Revolver”) and a sub-limit of the Revolver available for letters of credit up to an aggregate face amount of $
20.0
 million. These debt arrangements are collectively referred to herein as the “Credit Facilities”.
II-41

EverCommerce Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Effective as of July 1, 2023, borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at the Company’s option at ABR plus an applicable rate, or at a forward-looking term rate based upon the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus (i) (a) with respect to the Term Loan, credit spread adjustments of 
0.11448
%, 
0.26161
%, 
0.42826
% and 
0.71513
% for interest periods of one, three, six and twelve months, respectively, and (b) with respect to revolving loans, adjusted SOFR of 
0.0
% plus (ii) an applicable rate, in each case with such applicable rate based on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio. The ABR represents the highest of the prime rate, Federal Reserve Bank of New York rate plus ½ of 1%, and the Adjusted SOFR for a one month interest period plus 
1
%.
On December 13, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Facilities to reduce the applicable margin and remove the credit spread adjustment from the existing Term Loan in their entirety in an aggregate principal amount of $
533.5
 million. Following the Amendment, the Term Loan bears interest, at the borrower’s election, at (x) a forward-looking term rate based upon SOFR plus an applicable margin of 
2.50
%, with a minimum forward-looking SOFR rate 
0.50
% or (y) ABR plus an applicable margin of 
1.50
%, with a minimum ABR of 
1.50
%, in each case, with no step-downs. The credit spread adjustment was removed in connection with the Amendment. The refinanced Term Loan priced at par and refinanced all of the existing term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to giving effect to the Amendment.
The Company determines the fair value of long-term debt based on trading prices for its debt if available. As of December 31, 2024, the Company obtained trading prices for the term notes outstanding. However, as such trading prices require significant unobservable inputs to the pricing model, such instruments are classified as Level 2. The fair value amounts were approximately $
537.4
 million and $
540.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company has entered into the following interest rate swap agreements in connection with its Credit Facilities to convert a portion of the floating rate component of the Term Loan from a floating rate to fixed rate:

As of December 31, 2024 the fair value of the Initial Swap was a liability of $
0.9
 million, while the fair value of the Second and Third Swaps were an asset of $
2.4
 million, which are reported in other non-current liabilities and other non-current assets, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. The related net gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value was a gain of $
6.4
 million and losses of $
2.0
 million and $
2.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The Company’s Credit Facilities are subject to certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and are secured by substantially all assets of the Company. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants.

Repurchase Program
On June 14, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program (as subsequently amended, the “Repurchase Program”) with authorization to purchase up to $
50.0
 million in shares of the Company’s common stock through the expiration of the program on December 21, 2022. On November 7, 2022, November 5, 2023, and May 21, 2024, our Board increased the authorization of the Repurchase Program by an additional $
50.0
 million in shares of the Company’s common stock on each date for a total authorization to repurchase up to $
200.0
 million in shares of the Company’s common stock, and most recently, extended the expiration of the Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025. On December 14, 2023, our Board approved a stock purchase agreement entered into between the Company and Eric Remer, Matt Feierstein, Marc Thompson, Sarah Jordan, Shane Driggers and Evan Berlin, who served as officers of the Company at the time of the agreement (collectively, the “Selling Stockholders”). On December 19, 2023, as part of our Repurchase Program, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 
1,401,472
 shares of common stock from the Selling Stockholders at a price of $
9.82
 per share, for an aggregate price of $
13.8
 million. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at the Company’s discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of the Board. The Company expects to fund repurchases with existing cash on hand.
The Company repurchased and retired 
5.7
 million shares of common stock pursuant to the Repurchase Program for $
57.7
 million, including transaction fees and taxes, during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, $
32.7
 million remained available under the Repurchase Program.
Note 12. Stock-Based Compensation
In 2016, the Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”). The 2016 Plan provided for the granting of stock-based awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted or unrestricted stock awards, phantom stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards. The 2016 Plan allowed for the granting of stock-based awards through January 17, 2027.
In connection with the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), the Company’s Board adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the “2021 Plan”), which became effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement for the Company’s IPO and, as a result of which, the Company can no longer make awards under the 2016 Plan. The 2021 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock awards, stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan was 
22,000,000
 shares, inclusive of available shares previously reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan is subject to an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2031, equal to the lesser of (i) 
3
% of the shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Company’s Board, provided that no more than 
22,000,000
 shares may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options. Based on the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2023, on January 1, 2024 the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan increased by 
5.5
 million.
In August 2024, the Company adopted a "withhold to cover" program, which allows it to withhold common stock from employees in connection with the settlement of income tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of restricted stock unit (“RSUs”) under the 2021 Plan.
Stock options
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, the Company granted time-based and performance-based stock options to employees and directors. Time-based options granted under the 2016 Plan vest 
25
% after 
one year
, and then monthly over the next 
three years
. Time-based options granted to newly hired employees under the 2021 Plan generally vest 
25
% after 
one year
 and then quarterly over the next 
three years
. The vesting schedule for options granted to existing employees provides that the options vest ratably in quarterly installments over a period of 
four years
. Time-based options granted under both the 2016 Plan and the 2021 Plan expire 
10
 years from date of grant and carry an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant as determined by the Company’s Board for options granted under the 2016 Plan and an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant for options granted under the 2021 Plan. The Company did not grant stock options in 2023.
The performance-based options generally carried an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant as determined by the Board and expired 
10
 years from date of grant. For options outstanding following the IPO, there was a market condition based on the Company achieving a volume weighted average stock price ranging from $
27.41
 to $
36.54
 through June 2023, none of which vested. To date, $
17.4
 million of stock-based compensation expense has been recognized related to the market condition-based options.

Restricted Stock Units
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued time vesting RSUs. The vesting schedule for awards granted to newly hired employees provides that the awards vest over a

 period starting on the grant date, with 
25
% of the awards vesting on the 
one-year
 anniversary, and then in equal quarterly installments for the subsequent 
three years
. The vesting schedule for awards granted to existing employees provides that the awards vest ratably in quarterly installments over a period of 
four years
. The Company records compensation expense for these awards on a straight-line basis, which approximates the service period. Compensation expense of $
19.7

2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In connection with the IPO, the Company’s Board adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The ESPP is designed to allow eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock, at periodic intervals, with their accumulated payroll deductions. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP is equal to the sum of (i) 
4,500,000
 shares and (ii) an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning in 2022 and ending in and including 2031 equal to the lesser of (A) one percent (

Note 14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments. As these estimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair value.
The Company measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The Company utilizes a three-tier hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
•
Level 1:
 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access. 
•
Level 2:
 Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3:
 Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contract assets and accounts payable approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Our interest rate swaps are valued based upon interest yield curves, interest rate volatility and credit spreads. Our interest rate swaps are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as all significant inputs are corroborated by observable data.
There were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, a portion of our undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes have been recorded. As of December 31, 2024, there was no material unrecognized deferred tax liability related to countries where we are indefinitely reinvested. The remaining undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested, however, due to a combination of anticipated tax treatment and losses, no material deferred tax liability exists.

Management has not considered future projections of income in this analysis due to the Company’s history of losses. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and has recorded a valuation allowance of $
64.9
 million and $
51.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, against the deferred tax assets. If the Company’s assumptions change and we determine that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, will be accounted for as follows: $
64.4
 million will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense and $
0.4

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, Colorado, various other state jurisdictions, Canada, Jordan, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The years open for audit vary depending on the tax jurisdiction. In the U.S., the Company's federal tax returns for the years before 2021 (year ended December 31, 2021) are no longer subject to audit. The net operating losses utilized during the open periods from select years prior to 2021 are subject to examination. The foreign jurisdictions statutes vary but are generally four years from assessment of the return.
While management believes we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could materially differ from our accrued positions as a result of uncertain and complex application of tax regulations. Additionally, the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgment by management and inherently includes subjectivity. Accordingly, additional provision on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.

From time to time, the Company is involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Accruals for loss contingencies are recorded when a loss is probable, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. An adverse determination in one or more of these pending matters could have an adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
On January 31, 2024, plaintiff Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company, members of its Board of Directors (the “Board”) and the other parties to its sponsor stockholders agreement, dated June 30, 2021, Providence Strategic Growth II L.P., Providence Strategic Growth II-A L.P., SLA Eclipse Co-Invest, L.P., and SLA CM Eclipse Holdings, L.P. (collectively, the “Sponsor Stockholders”), captioned Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust v. Eric Remer, Penny Baldwin, et. al., Case No. 2024-0077 (Del Ch.). The complaint generally alleges violations of Section 141(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) by providing the Sponsor Stockholders with a veto right over the Board’s ability to hire or fire the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Approval Right”) on the basis that it unlawfully limits the Board’s authority to manage the business and affairs of the Company. The plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment that the CEO Approval Right is invalid and void, other declaratory and equitable relief for the class and/or the Company, attorneys’ and experts’

witness fees and other costs and expenses, and other equitable relief. On June 14, 2024, the Company filed its opening brief in support of its Motion to Dismiss, and on July 15, 2024, Plaintiff opposed that motion. On July 16, 2024, the court entered a stipulation and order dismissing the director defendants from the action. On August 29, 2024, the remaining defendants, the Company and Sponsor Stockholders (collectively, “Defendants”), filed their reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss, and pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply on September 26, 2024, which Defendants filed a response to on October 10, 2024. On October 15, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, arguing that the claims alleged are not ripe for adjudication and on November 15, 2024 Plaintiff opposed that motion. On December 9, 2024, Defendants filed their reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. On January 3, 2025, the Court entered a minute order deferring oral argument on the pending Motion to Dismiss until after the disposition of the appeal in Moelis & Company v. West Palm Beach Firefighters’ Pension Fund, Case No. 340, 2024 (Del. Supr.). The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims of the plaintiff and members of the class and any liability for the alleged claims is not currently probable and the potential loss or range of loss is not reasonably estimable.
The Company is party to additional legal proceedings incidental to its business. While the outcome of these additional matters could differ from management’s expectations, the Company does not believe that the resolution of such matters is reasonably likely to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
The Company assesses the applicability of nexus in jurisdictions in which the Company sells products and services. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a liability in the amount of $
10.7
 million and $
10.9
 million, respectively, within current liabilities and other long-term liabilities as a provision for sales and use and gross receipts tax. In connection with the Company's accounting for acquisitions, the Company has recorded liabilities and corresponding provisional escrow or indemnity receivables within the purchase price allocations for instances in which the Company is indemnified for tax matters.

Note 19. Segment Reporting
The Company operates in a single reportable segment. The segment derives revenue from providing SaaS and other technology-based solutions to help service SMB’s optimize their operations, improve customer relationships and experience, and accelerate growth. The Company primarily focuses on three core vertical markets: EverPro for Home Services, EverHealth for Health Services, and EverWell for Wellness Services.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer.
The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Based on being a single reportable segment company, the Company has disclosed net loss as its primary measure of profit or loss used by the CODM, which is reported on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as net loss. The CODM is provided financial information inclusive of net loss, which is used to assess performance of the segment and decide how to allocate resources. The CODM uses net loss, among other metrics, to assist in evaluating the financial performance of the Company and monitoring budget versus actual results. The CODM does not review assets in evaluating segments results, and therefore, such information is not presented. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets.
Disaggregated information is not used for assessing the performance of the Company or for making resource allocation decisions. The CODM reviews financial information presented on an aggregated and consolidated basis, together with revenue information of the three core vertical markets. The software and technology-based solutions provided by the Company are deployed and implemented to customers in a similar manner regardless of industry. See Notes 4. Revenue and 18. Geographic Areas for disaggregated information regarding the Company's revenues and long-lived assets by geography, respectively.

Note 20. Subsequent Event
In late 2024, the Company began a process to review strategic alternatives for its marketing technology solutions. On March 5, the Board, in conjunction with Company management committed to a plan to sell the Company’s marketing technology solutions, which is expected to result in a sales transaction in 2025. The Company is currently engaged in an active program to sell its marketing technology solutions. As such, the Company will present marketing technology solutions as discontinued operations beginning with the first quarter 2025.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures 
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
II-52
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
Under the supervision of and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and the Company’s overall control environment. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to the existence of the material weakness described below. The material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements in the current period consolidated financial statements, nor in any of the consolidated financial statements previously reported by us, and there were no changes in previously released financial results.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The scope of our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting includes all of our Company’s consolidated operations.
In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified a material weakness, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that has not been remediated as of December 31, 2024 related to the lack of properly designed controls over certain of our order to cash revenue accounting processes. Specifically, adequate controls are not in place primarily as a result of (a) the lack of full system integration for certain of our order to cash systems and (b) control deficiencies within the manual controls designed to mitigate that risk.
Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.
Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness
While progress has been made to remediate the material weakness, as of December 31, 2024, we are still in the process of remediating the aforementioned material weakness and will continue our efforts to do so until such remediation is complete. While we have taken steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting and have remediated our previously identified material weakness related to certain information technology general controls (“ITGCs”), we maintain a disaggregated information technology infrastructure due to a series of historical business combinations. As a result, we have determined that certain of our systems have not been fully integrated, including within certain revenue cycles of customer order to billing, increasing the number of manual controls necessary for our control environment.
We expect to implement remediation plans for the aforementioned material weakness which may include the following:
•
Enhanced system integration within customer order to billing processes within relevant product offerings;
•
Investment in information technology systems and resourcing for the integrations noted above; 
•
Identification and implementation of an enhanced system of manual controls while system integrations are ongoing; and
•
Additional training and resourcing associated with manual controls through the enterprise surrounding customer order through billing.
We will monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plans and will make the changes management determines to be appropriate.   While we will endeavor to remediate our material weaknesses as soon as practicable, the program of remediation effort may extend beyond the year ending December 31, 2025.
II-53
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than as described above with respect to our remediation efforts to address the material weakness, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information
(a) None.
(b) During the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company 
adopted

 a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
