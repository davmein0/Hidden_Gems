Item 2. Properties
Our global corporate headquarters is located in Denver, Colorado, where we currently lease and occupy approximately 50,125 square feet of office space. The lease for this facility expires in 2031 with an option to extend the lease for an additional five years. In October 2023, the Company subleased approximately 24,000 square feet of the Denver office space for an initial three year period with an option for the subtenant to extend.
We also lease 12 additional office locations throughout the United States, two offices in Canada, and one office in Jordan, several of which include office spaces that are subleased to third parties. We do not own any real property.
We believe that these facilities are sufficient for our current needs and that additional space will be available to accommodate the expansion of our businesses should they be needed. Additionally, we also often take on leases when we acquire businesses, and we explore optimization of our overall lease footprint in conjunction with any new leases assumed in an acquisition.
