On June 14, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program (as subsequently amended, the “Repurchase Program”) with authorization to purchase up to $50.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock through the expiration of the program on December 21, 2022. On November 7, 2022, November 5, 2023, and May 21, 2024, our Board increased the authorization of the Repurchase Program by an additional $50.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock on each date for a total authorization to repurchase up to $200.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock, and most recently, extended the expiration of the Repurchase Program through December 31, 2025.
Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases to be determined at our discretion, depending on market conditions and corporate needs. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including within the pricing and volume requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of the Board. We expect to fund repurchases with existing cash on hand.
