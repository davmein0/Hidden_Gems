Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risk and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business
Our limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.
Our limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate and assess the success of our business to date, our future prospects and the risks and challenges that we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:
•
attract new and digitally-inclined service SMBs to the EverCommerce platform;
•
retain existing customers and leverage cross-sell and upsell opportunities;
•
successfully update the EverCommerce platform, including expanding into new verticals and international markets and integrating additional solution capabilities to further benefit our service SMB customers and enhance the end-customer experience;
•
expand through future acquisitions and successfully identify and integrate acquired entities, services and technologies;
•
hire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;
•
comply with existing and new laws and regulations applicable to our business and in the industries in which we participate;
•
anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes, changes within the existing and future industries in which we participate, including the Home Services, Health Services and Wellness industries, and changes in the markets in which we operate;
•
foresee and manage market volatility impacts on market value;
•
react to challenges from existing and new competitors;
•
improve and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;
•
effectively manage our growth; and
•
maintain and improve the infrastructure underlying the EverCommerce platform, including our software, websites, mobile applications and data centers, as well as our cybersecurity and data protection measures.
If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above and those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and our business continues to evolve and expand within the industries in which we operate, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history, operated a more predictable business or operated in a single or unregulated industry. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories and evolving businesses that operate in regulated and competitive industries. If our assumptions regarding 
I-12
these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Our recent growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth.
Since our founding, we have generated revenue growth through acquisitions and by driving organic growth of our business. Our revenue has grown at a CAGR of 12.5% from 2021 to 2024, and reached $698.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, up from $675.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represents revenue growth of 3.5% from 2023 to 2024. Our historical rate of growth may not be sustainable or indicative of our future rate of growth. For example, while acquisitions have significantly contributed to our growth to date, we may make fewer or no acquisitions in the future. We believe that our continued growth in revenue, as well as our ability to improve or maintain margins and profitability, will depend upon, among other factors, our ability to address the challenges, risks and difficulties described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and the extent to which our various offerings grow and contribute to our results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully manage any such challenges or risks to our future growth. In addition, our base of customers may not continue to grow or may decline due to a variety of possible risks, including changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, interest rates and tariffs, increased competition, changes in the regulatory landscape and the maturation of our business. Any of these factors could cause our revenue growth to decline and may adversely affect our margins and profitability. Failure to continue our revenue growth or improve margins would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should not rely on our historical rate of revenue growth as an indication of our future performance.
To manage our current and anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our technology infrastructure, financial and accounting systems and controls. We must also attract, train and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel, client support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel and management personnel, and the availability of such personnel, in particular software engineers, may be constrained.
A key element of how we manage our growth is our ability to scale our capabilities and satisfactorily implement our solutions for our customers’ needs. Failure to effectively manage our growth could also lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, financial losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees.
We have experienced net losses in the past and we may not achieve profitability in the future.
We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception. Our net loss was $41.1 million and $45.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our operating expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to grow our business and build relationships with or clients and partners, develop new solutions and comply with requirements of being a public company. These efforts may prove to be more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks and difficulties of investing to grow our business, building relationships and developing new solutions as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
We may continue to experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict.
Historically, we have experienced fluctuations in period to period operating results, with stronger results and higher revenue in the second and third quarters of the year, and our quarterly and annual operating results may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Our past results may not be a predictor of our future performance.
Factors that may affect our operating results and the ability to predict our future results and trajectory include:
•
our ability to increase sales to existing customers and to renew agreements with our existing customers at comparable prices;
•
our ability to attract new customers with greater needs for our services;
•
changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors, or pricing pressure on our software and related services;
•
periodic fluctuations in demand for our software and services and volatility in the sales of our solutions and services;
•
the success or failure of our acquisition or divestiture strategy;
•
our ability to timely develop and implement new solutions and services, as well as improve and enhance existing solutions and services, in a manner that meets customer requirements;
•
our ability to hire, train and retain key personnel;
I-13
•
any significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including new entrants or substantial discounting of products or services;
•
our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;
•
any significant change in our facilities-related costs;
•
the timing of hiring personnel and of large expenses such as those for third-party professional services;
•
technological developments, including new uses for generative AI;
•
general economic conditions;
•
our ability to appropriately resolve any disputes relating to our intellectual property; and
•
the impact of a recession, pandemic or any other adverse global economic conditions on our business.
We have in the past experienced, and we may experience in the future, significant variations in our level of sales. Such variations in our sales have led and may lead to significant fluctuations in our cash flows, revenue and deferred revenue on a quarterly and annual basis. Failure to achieve our quarterly goals will decrease our value and, accordingly, the value of our securities.
In order to support the growth of our business and our acquisition strategy, we may need to incur additional indebtedness or seek capital through new equity or debt financings, which sources of additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.
Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and we intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth, acquire complementary businesses and technologies, respond to business challenges or opportunities, develop new solutions and services and enhance our existing solutions and services and operating infrastructure. Our net cash provided by operating activities was $113.2 million in 2024 and $104.6 million in 2023. We had cash and cash equivalents of $135.8 million and no restricted cash as of December 31, 2024. 
Our future capital requirements may be significantly different from our current estimates and will depend on many factors, including the need to:
•
finance unanticipated working capital requirements;
•
acquire complementary businesses, technologies, solutions or services;
•
develop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing solutions and services;
•
fund strategic relationships, including joint ventures and co-investments;
•
respond to competitive pressures; and
•
manage costs associated with any adverse market conditions or other macroeconomic factors.
Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings or collaborative arrangements to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our ordinary shares. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, during times of economic instability, it has been difficult for many companies to obtain financing in the public markets or to obtain debt financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the Company maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all.
We may not be able to continue to expand our share of our existing vertical markets or expand into new vertical markets, which would inhibit our ability to grow and increase our profitability.
Our future growth and profitability depend, in part, upon our continued expansion within the vertical markets in which we currently operate, the emergence of other vertical markets for our solutions and our ability to penetrate new vertical markets. As part of our strategy to expand into new vertical markets, we look for acquisition opportunities and partnerships that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, offering of solutions and distribution capabilities. We may not be able to successfully 
I-14
identify suitable acquisition or partnership candidates in the future, and if we do, they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated.
Our expansion into new vertical markets also depends upon our ability to adapt our existing technology or to develop new technologies to meet the particular needs of each new vertical market. We may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services or distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new vertical markets. Penetrating these new vertical markets may also prove to be more challenging or costly or take longer than we may anticipate. Further, as positive references from existing customers are vital to expanding into new vertical and geographic markets within the service economy, any dissatisfaction on the part of existing customers may harm our brand and reputation and inhibit market acceptance of our services. If we fail to expand into new vertical markets and increase our penetration into existing vertical markets, we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.
We face intense competition in each of the industries in which we operate, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and cause our market share to decline.
The market for our solutions and services is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. As our platform is utilized across industries, we compete in a variety of highly fragmented markets and face competition from a variety of sources, including manual processes, basic PC tools, homegrown solutions, as well as from vertically-specialized and horizontal competitors. Vertically-specialized competitors include mobile sales applications and field service management platforms in Home Services, EHR / EMR and practice management platforms in Health Services and scheduling and management in Wellness Services. Horizontal competitors include Salesforce for CRM, Intuit for financial products, Square for payments and HubSpot for marketing-related solutions.
We expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors develop stronger capabilities. Our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their offerings than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs and achieve wider market acceptance. Because the barriers to entry into our industry are generally low, we expect to continue to face competition from new entrants. We also encounter competition from a broad range of firms which possess greater resources than we do, and small independent firms that compete primarily on the basis of price. We may not compete effectively, and competitive pressures might prevent us from acquiring and maintaining the customer base necessary for us to be successful.
We may also potentially face competition from our current partners. Our partners, including our integration partners for our EHR and PM solutions within Health Services, our Business Management Software solutions within Home Services and our payment and CRM solutions within Wellness Services, as well as our third-party payment processing partners, could become our competitors by offering similar services. Some of our partners offer, or may begin to offer, services in the same or similar manner as we do. Although there are many potential opportunities for, and applications of, these services, our partners may seek opportunities or target new clients in areas that may overlap with those that we have chosen to pursue.
We may face competition from companies that we do not yet know about. If existing or new companies develop or market products or services that are similar to ours, develop entirely new solutions, acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our competitors or other industry participants, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly impacted, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The industries in which we operate are rapidly evolving and the market for technology-enabled services that empower SMBs is relatively immature and unproven. If we are not successful in promoting the benefits of or maintaining the competitiveness of our solutions and services, our growth may be limited.
Our three current verticals represent markets for our solutions and services that are subject to rapid and significant change. The market for software and technology-enabled services that empower SMBs is characterized by rapid technological change, new product and service introductions, consumerism and engagement and the entrance of non-traditional competitors. In addition, there may be a limited-time opportunity to achieve and maintain a significant share of these markets due in part to the rapidly evolving nature of the businesses within our Home Services, Health Services and Wellness Services verticals, the technology industries that support these businesses and the substantial resources available to our existing and potential competitors. The market for technology-enabled services within these verticals is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether this market will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market adoption.
In order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects to compete with these new market entrants by developing new services, growing our client base and penetrating new markets. Some of these projects include the expansion of our integration capabilities around our vertical markets, such as field service management, EHR, PM and other solutions. These projects 
I-15
carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of acceptance by our clients, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Moreover, our ability to grow organically may be limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the verticals in which we operate or a change or reduction in demand from SMBs due to changing economic conditions, strategic priorities, or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development, and timely responses to changing SMB demands and preferences. Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing SMB preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential, affect our competitive position, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Consolidation in the industries in which we operate could decrease demand for our solutions and services by existing and potential clients in such industries.
Participants and businesses in the industries in which we operate may consolidate and merge to create larger or more integrated entities with greater market power. We expect regulatory, economic and other conditions to result in additional consolidation in the future. As consolidation accelerates, the economies of scale of our clients’ organizations may grow. If a client experiences sizable growth following consolidation, it may determine that it no longer needs to rely on us and may reduce its demand for our solutions and services. In addition, if an existing independent client elects to become a part of a franchise group, or if an existing franchise client opts to change to a different franchise group, such clients may be required by the terms of their respective franchise group to use different solutions and services, which would have an adverse impact on our operations and demand for our solutions. Furthermore, as companies consolidate to create larger and more integrated entities with greater market power, these new entities may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our solutions and services. Finally, consolidation may also result in the acquisition or future development by our customers of products and services that compete with our solutions and services. Any of these potential results of consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are dependent on payment card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, and payment processors, such as Worldpay and PayPal, and if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment networks or our payment processors, they can seek to fine us, suspend us, terminate our agreements and/or terminate our registrations through our bank sponsors.
We have entered into agreements with certain payment processors, including Worldpay and PayPal, in order to enable our clients’ processing of credit, debit and prepaid card transactions through the card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard. Pursuant to these agreements with payment processors, we are registered with the card networks as an independent sales organization (“ISO”) of our sponsor bank(s) or as a payment facilitator(s), and are subject to the requirements of our bank sponsors, payment processors, as well as the card network rules and certain other obligations. The payment networks routinely update and modify requirements applicable to merchant acquirers (i.e., sponsor banks) which are passed through to third parties such as ISOs or payment facilitators like us, including rules regarding data integrity, third-party relationships (such as those with respect to bank sponsors and ISOs), merchant chargeback standards and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”).
If we fail to comply with the applicable rules and requirements of the payment card networks, bank sponsors or payment processors, they could suspend or terminate our registration (with the payment networks) and/or terminate our ISO and/or payment facilitator agreements, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale. Further, our transaction processing abilities, including with respect to settlement processes, could be delayed or otherwise disrupted. As required by the PCI DSS (and the payment network rules), we may be required to submit to periodic third-party audits, self-assessments or other assurances of our compliance with the PCI DSS. Such reviews and audits may reveal that we have failed to comply with the PCI DSS (which could subject us to fines and penalties by the payment card networks). In addition, even if we comply with the PCI DSS, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Our contracts with payment processors, including Worldpay and PayPal, include standard confidentiality, indemnification and data protection obligations, among others. Our contracts with Worldpay and PayPal provide for certain termination events, such as material breach, and are subject to automatic annual renewal unless terminated by either party upon prior notice or for cause. The termination of our registration with the payment networks or our agreements with the payment processors, or any changes in payment network, payment processor or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide merchant services, could have an adverse effect on our payment processing volumes, revenues and operating costs. If we are unable to comply with the requirements applicable to our obligations under the payment networks rules or payment processor agreements, the payment networks or payment processors may no longer allow us to provide these services, which would require us to spend additional resources to obtain settlement services from a third-party provider. In addition, if we were precluded from allowing our clients to process Visa and MasterCard transactions, which we access through our payment processor arrangements, we would lose substantially all of our revenue.
We are also subject to the operating rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”), a self-regulatory organization which administers and facilitates private-sector operating rules for ACH payments and defines the roles and 
I-16
responsibilities of financial institutions and other ACH network participants. The NACHA Rules and Operating Guidelines impose obligations on us and our partner financial institutions. These obligations include audit and oversight by the financial institutions and the imposition of mandatory corrective action, including termination, for serious violations. If an audit or self-assessment under NACHA identifies any deficiencies that we need to remediate, the remediation efforts may distract our management team and be expensive and time consuming.
If we cannot keep pace with rapid developments and changes in the electronic payments market or are unable to introduce, develop and market new and enhanced versions of our software solutions, we may be put at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our services that incorporated payment technology.
Payment-related transactions comprised approximately 17% of our revenue in 2024. The electronic payments market is subject to constant and significant changes. This market is characterized by rapid technological evolution, new product and service introductions, evolving industry standards, changing client needs and the entrance of non-traditional competitors, including products and services that enable card networks and banks to transact with consumers directly. To remain competitive, we continually pursue initiatives to develop new solutions and services to compete with these new market entrants. These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of client acceptance. In addition, new solutions and offerings may not perform as intended or generate the business or revenue growth expected. Any delay in the delivery of new solutions and services or the failure to differentiate our solutions and services or to accurately predict and address market demand could render our solutions and services less desirable, or even obsolete, to our clients and to our distribution partners. Furthermore, even though the market for integrated payment processing solutions and services is evolving, it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new solutions and services targeted at this market. Any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
The continued growth and development of our payment processing activities will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behavior. For example, consumer behavior may change regarding the use of payment card transactions, including the relative increased use of crypto-currencies, other emerging or alternative payment methods and payment card systems that we or our processing partners do not adequately support or that do not provide adequate revenue to parties like us. Any failure to timely integrate emerging payment methods into our software, to anticipate consumer behavior changes or to contract with processing partners that support such emerging payment technologies could cause us to lose traction among our customers or referral sources, resulting in a corresponding loss of revenue, if those methods become popular among end-users of their services.
The solutions and services we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. Our technology offerings must also integrate with a variety of network, hardware, mobile and software platforms and technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions and services to adapt to changes and innovation in these technologies. Any failure to deliver an effective, reliable and secure service or any performance issue that arises with a new solution or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. If we do not deliver a promised new solution or service to our clients or distribution partners in a timely manner or the solution or service does not perform as anticipated, our development efforts could result in increased costs and a loss in business that could reduce our earnings and cause a loss of revenue. We also rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies, including software and hardware. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to develop, adapt to or access technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our solutions could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.
Our customers expect a consistent level of quality in the provision of our solutions and services. The support services that we provide are also a key element of the value proposition to our customers. However, complex technological solutions such as ours often contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Errors will affect the implementation, as well as the performance, of our solutions and software and could delay the development or release of new solutions or new versions of solutions, adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to buy solutions from us, and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our solutions. We may also experience technical or other difficulties in the integration of acquired technologies and software solutions into our existing platforms and applications. Any such errors or delays in introducing or implementing new or enhanced solutions or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs, cause us to lose significant customers, negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
I-17
Unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification of data, disruption of our software or services or cyber breaches could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation and damage our reputation.
We are responsible both for our own business and to a significant degree for acts and omissions by certain of our distribution partners and third-party vendors under the rules and regulations established by the payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express and the debit networks. We and other third parties collect, process, store and transmit sensitive data, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, credit or debit card numbers and expiration dates or other payment card information, drivers’ license numbers and bank account numbers, and we have ultimate liability to the payment networks and member financial institutions that register us with the payment networks for our failure, or the failure of certain distribution partners and third parties with whom we contract, to protect this data in accordance with payment network requirements. Certain of our software and technology-enabled services are intended for use in collecting, storing and displaying clinical and health care-related information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients and in related health care settings such as registration, scheduling and billing. We attempt to limit by contract our liability, however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or otherwise protect us from liability, and we may also be subject to claims that are not covered by contract. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any claim, prove to be adequate or continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. The loss, destruction or unauthorized modification of client or cardholder data could result in significant fines, sanctions and proceedings or actions against us by the payment networks, payment processors, sponsor banks, governmental bodies, our customers, our clients’ customers or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such sanction, fine, proceeding or action could result in significant damage to our reputation or the reputation of our customers, negatively impact our ability to attract or retain customers, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of these proceedings, disrupt our operations, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. A significant cybersecurity breach could also result in payment networks prohibiting us from processing transactions on their networks or the loss of our financial institution sponsorship that facilitates our participation in the payment networks, either of which could materially impede our ability to conduct business.
In addition, our products and services have been and may in the future be targets of cyber-attacks that attempt to sabotage or otherwise disable them, and the defensive and preventative measures we take ultimately may not be able to effectively detect, prevent, or protect against or otherwise mitigate losses from all cyber-attacks. Threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and insider threats. Certain efforts may be supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyber-attacks, cyber-extortion, ransomware attacks, spear phishing and social engineering schemes, the introduction of computer viruses or other malware and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data in our systems. Despite our efforts to create security barriers against such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to eliminate these risks entirely. Any such breach could compromise our networks or the products we offer our customers, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products. Additionally, the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, any of which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. These breaches, or any perceived breach, may also result in reporting obligations, damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of key partners, customers and transactions, increased remedial costs, or costly litigation, and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products and services and may seriously affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their websites, mobile applications and infrastructure. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to systems and information (including customers’ personal data), disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence.
We have been and could in the future be subject to breaches of security by hackers or other malicious actors. Although we proactively employ multiple measures to defend our systems against intrusions and attacks and to protect the data we collect, our measures may not prevent unauthorized access or use of sensitive data. We experience cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, though none which individually or in the aggregate has led to costs or consequences which have materially impacted our operations or business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in our efforts to modify or enhance our protective measures against evolving threats. A breach of our system or a third-party system upon which we rely may subject us to material losses or liability, including payment network fines, assessments and claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated credit, debit or card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. A misuse of such data or a 
I-18
cybersecurity breach could harm our reputation and deter our clients and potential clients from using electronic payments generally and our solutions and services specifically, thus reducing our revenue. In addition, any such misuse or breach could cause us to incur costs to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits and result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under state and federal laws or by the payment networks. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.
Although we generally require that our agreements with our distribution partners and service providers who have access to client and customer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any client or customer data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements, there can be no assurance that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure of business or client data, nor can we be sure that such third parties would be willing or able to satisfy liabilities arising from their breach of these agreements. Any failure by such third parties to adequately take these protective measures could result in protracted or costly litigation.
In addition, our agreements with our bank sponsors (as well as payment network requirements) require us to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of business and consumer data. Any failure to adequately comply with these protective measures could result in fees, penalties, litigation or termination of our bank sponsor agreements, and/or registration with the payment card networks.
Our existing general liability and cyber liability insurance policies may not cover, or may cover only a portion of, any potential claims related to security breaches to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all or any portion of liabilities that may be imposed. We also cannot be certain that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage of any future claim. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity measures and those of our service providers, fail to protect against unauthorized access, attacks (which may include sophisticated cyber-attacks) and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, then our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, there can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information.
Our use of artificial intelligence technologies may not be beneficial to our business, and may cause the performance of our products, services and business, as well as our reputation and the reputations of our customers, to suffer or cause us to incur liability resulting from the violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party.
We are developing and/or implementing artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning, and automated decision-making technologies (collectively, “AI Technologies”) throughout our business, and are making significant investments in this area. 
We expect that increased investment will be required in the future to continuously improve our use of AI Technologies. As with many technological innovations, there are significant risks involved in developing, maintaining and deploying these technologies and there can be no assurance that the usage of or our investments in such technologies will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. 
In particular, if the models underlying our AI Technologies are: incorrectly designed or implemented; trained or reliant on incomplete, inadequate, inaccurate, biased or otherwise poor quality data, or on data to which we do not have sufficient rights or in relation to which we and/or the providers of such data have not implemented sufficient legal compliance measures; used without sufficient oversight and governance to ensure their responsible use; and/or adversely impacted by unforeseen defects, technical challenges, cybersecurity threats or material performance issues, the performance of our products, services and business, as well as our reputation and the reputations of our customers, could suffer or we could incur liability resulting from the violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party or civil claims. 
With respect to our products or services that incorporate AI Technology, the market for such products and services is rapidly evolving and unproven in many industries, including our own, and important assumptions about the characteristics of targeted markets, pricing, sales cycles, cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our services or products may be inaccurate. We cannot be sure that the market will continue to grow or that it will grow in ways we anticipate. In addition, market acceptance of products and services that incorporate AI Technology is uncertain. Our failure to successfully develop and commercialize our products or services involving AI Technologies could depress the market price of our stock and impair our ability to: raise capital; expand our business; provide, improve and diversify our product offerings; continue our operations and efficiently manage our operating expenses; and respond effectively to competitive developments.
We use AI Technologies licensed from third parties in our technologies and our ability to continue to use such technologies at the scale we need may be dependent on access to specific third-party software and infrastructure. We cannot control the availability or 
I-19
pricing of such third-party AI Technologies, especially in a highly competitive environment, and we may be unable to negotiate favorable economic terms with the applicable providers. If any such third-party AI Technologies become incompatible with our solutions or unavailable for use, or if the providers of such models unfavorably change the terms on which their AI Technologies are offered or terminate their relationship with us, our solutions may become less appealing to our customers and our business will be harmed. In addition, to the extent any third party AI Technologies are used as a hosted service, any disruption, outage, or loss of information through such hosted services could disrupt our operations or solutions, damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our solutions, or result in legal claims or proceedings, for which we may be unable to recover damages from the affected provider.
Our estimated total addressable market is subject to inherent challenges and uncertainties. If we have overestimated the size of our total addressable market or the various markets in which we operate, our future growth opportunities may be limited.
We estimate the TAM, defined above, for our current solutions for service SMBs was approximately $1.6 trillion globally in 2023, of which approximately $662 billion was in North America, which refers to the United States and Canada. Of the $662 billion, we estimate a $$69 billion opportunity in Home Services, a $115 billion opportunity in Health Services, a $22 billion opportunity in Wellness Services and a $456 billion opportunity in other services categories. We have based our estimates on a number of internal and third-party estimates and resources, including, without limitation, third party reports and the experience of our management team across these industries. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our current solutions and services may prove to be incorrect. If third-party or internally generated data prove to be inaccurate or we make errors in our assumptions based on that data, the annual total addressable market for our solutions and services may be smaller than we have estimated, our future growth opportunities and sales growth may be impaired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We calculate certain operational metrics using internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
We refer to a number of operational metrics in our public disclosures, including Pro Forma Revenue Growth Rate, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), monthly net pro forma revenue retention rate, lifetime value of a customer, customer acquisition costs and other metrics. We calculate these metrics using internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party. These metrics may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties or other companies due to differences in sources, methodologies or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose on an ongoing basis. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics under count or over count performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we present may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring savings, the use of our solutions, services and offerings and other metrics. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which would affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics or our estimates are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.
Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance and utilization of our solutions.
Our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our solutions and services will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organizations, and to deploy our sales and marketing resources efficiently. An important component of our growth strategy is to increase the cross-selling of our solutions and services to current and future SMB customers. However, if we are not successful in doing so, or our existing and potential customers find our additional solutions and services to be unnecessary or unattractive, we may not be able to increase our customer base. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, significant resources in expanding our sales initiatives as well as our sales force focused on identifying new strategic partners. However, we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate and retain talented and effective sales personnel, or if our new and existing sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.
We also dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs. The effectiveness and cost of our online advertising has varied over time and may vary in the future due to competition for key search terms, changes in search engine use and changes in the 
I-20
search algorithms and rules used by major search engines. These efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business and operating results will be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant increases in revenue.
If we are not able to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition, our business and results of operations may be harmed.
We believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand recognition is critical to our relationships with existing clients and the customers or patients that they serve and to our ability to attract new clients. As our marketing efforts depend significantly on positive recommendations and referrals from our current and past SMB customers, a failure to maintain and provide high-quality solutions and services, or a market perception that we do not maintain or provide high-quality solutions and services, may harm our reputation and impair our ability to secure new customers. Any decisions we make regarding regulatory compliance, user privacy, payments and other issues, and any media, legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our business, or our current or former directors, employees, contractors, or vendors, could negatively affect our brands. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance the integrity, quality, efficiency and scalability of our software and systems, as well as our reputation and brand recognition among our customers and the end customers they serve, our business may not grow and we could lose existing customers, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the success of our digital lead generation capabilities within our EverPro platform depends, in part, on our ability to establish and maintain relationships with quality and trustworthy home service professionals and home improvement contractors, such as home maintenance technicians and security alarm professionals operating in both residential and commercial settings. We provide our home service professionals with solutions to capture and manage lead generations to residential homeowners and business owners, who in turn want to work with home service professionals whom they can trust to provide quality workmanship. Unsatisfactory work performed by any of our recommended home service professionals could result in bad publicity and related damage to our reputation and/or litigation, which in turn may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Further, the promotion of our platforms and services may require us to make substantial investments and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these marketing initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Our marketing activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur and our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our management, including failing to meet the expectations of our customers, could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new customers.
If we are unable to retain our current customers, which are primarily SMBs, or sell additional functionality and services to them, our revenue growth may be adversely affected.
To increase our revenue, in addition to acquiring new customers, we must continue to retain existing clients and convince them to expand their use of our solutions and services by increasing the number of users and incenting them to pay for additional functionality. Many of our clients are SMBs, which can be more difficult to retain than large enterprises as SMBs often have higher rates of business failures and more limited resources, particularly in weaker economic environments, and are typically less able to make technology-related decisions based on factors other than price. Further, SMBs are fragmented in terms of size, geography, sophistication and nature of business and, consequently, are more challenging to serve at scale and in a cost-effective manner. As a result, we may be unable to retain existing clients or increase the usage of our solutions and services by them, which would have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and other operating results, and accordingly, on the trading price of our common stock.
Our ability to sell additional functionality to our existing customers may require more sophisticated and costly sales efforts, especially for our larger customers with more experienced management and established procurement functions. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase additional solutions from us depends on several factors, including general economic conditions and the pricing of additional functionality. SMBs are typically more susceptible to such factors and any adverse changes in the economic environment or business failures of our SMB customers may have a greater impact on us than on our competitors who do not focus on SMBs to the extent that we do. If our efforts to sell additional functionality to our clients are not successful, our business and growth prospects would suffer.
While some of our contracts are non-cancelable annual subscription contracts, most of our contracts with clients primarily consist of open-ended arrangements that can be terminated by either party without penalty, generally upon providing 30-day notice. Our clients have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions and services after the expiration of their subscription period. For us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers continue to maintain their subscriptions on the same or more favorable terms. We cannot accurately predict renewal or expansion rates given the diversity of our customer base in terms of size, industry and geography. Our renewal and expansion rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of several factors, including consumer spending levels, client satisfaction with our solutions and services, decreases in the number of users, changes in the type and 
I-21
size of our customers, pricing changes, competitive conditions, the acquisition of our customers by other companies and general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, our revenue and other operating results will decline and our business will suffer. If our renewal or expansion rates fall significantly below the expectations of the public market, securities analysts, or investors, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.
Further, we have key customers and a more pronounced customer concentration in certain markets. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their usage of our solutions and services may reduce our sales revenue and net profit. There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their solutions and services from competitors or begin to develop such solutions or services in-house. Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Impairment in the value of our goodwill or intangible assets has adversely impacted and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
We record goodwill and intangible assets at fair value upon the acquisition of a business. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Declines in operating results, divestitures, sustained market declines and other factors that impact the fair value of our reporting unit has and may in the future result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets and, in turn, a charge to net income (loss). These charges in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and any future charges have, and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
During the fourth quarter 2024, in conjunction with our review of strategic alternatives for our Marketing Technology Solutions, and as a result of lower than expected financial performance and future forecasted growth rates we determined that the estimated fair value of our marketing technology solutions reporting unit was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the reporting unit resulting in an impairment of goodwill of approximately $28.1 million.

In connection with the definitive sale and purchase agreements to sell our Fitness Solutions, we tested the goodwill balance for impairment as of March 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $6.4 million of goodwill impairment charges representing the allocated goodwill to Fitness Solutions.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company evaluated the recoverability of our fitness asset group. As a result of our evaluation, we determined that the estimated fair value of our fitness asset group was insufficient to recover the net carrying value of the asset group resulting in an impairment charge of approximately $5.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023, of which $3.1 million related to intangible assets.
Our information technology systems and our third-party providers’ information technology systems, including Worldpay, PayPal and other payment processing partners, may fail, or our third-party providers may discontinue providing their services or technology generally or to us specifically, which in either case could interrupt our business, cause us to lose business and increase our costs.
We rely on our systems, technology and infrastructure to perform well on a consistent basis. From time to time in the past we have experienced (and in the future we may experience) occasional interruptions that make some or all of this framework and related information unavailable or that prevent us from providing solutions and services. Any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons. We also rely on third parties, such as Worldpay, PayPal and other payment processing partners, for specific services, software and hardware used in providing our solutions and services. Some of these organizations and service providers are our competitors or provide similar services and technology to our competitors, and we may not have long-term contracts with them. If these contracts are canceled or we are unable to renew them on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely impacted. The termination by our service or technology providers of their agreements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and, if we cannot find alternate providers quickly, may cause those clients to terminate their processing agreements with us. We will continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our framework to improve the consumer and service professional experience, accommodate substantial increases in the number of visitors to our various platforms, ensure acceptable load times for our various solutions and services and keep up with changes in technology and user preferences. If we do not do so in a timely and cost-effective manner, the user experience and demand across our brands and businesses could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our information technology systems and operations or those of our third-party technology vendors could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, extreme weather events (including floods, storms, droughts and extreme temperatures) and other natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, acts of 
I-22
terrorism, human error, vandalism or sabotage, financial insolvency and similar events. Extreme weather events, changing water levels, as well as changes in ambient temperature and precipitation patterns, may become more frequent or severe as a result of climate change. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur, and the cost and availability of such insurance may be adversely impacted to the extent events become more frequent or severe. While we and the third parties upon whom we rely have certain backup systems in place for certain aspects of our respective frameworks, none of our frameworks are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities, particularly given some of the uncertainties associated with longer term projections, including those associated with climate change. Defects in our information technology systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties could result in:
•
loss of revenues;
•
loss of clients;
•
loss of client and cardholder data;
•
fines imposed by payment networks or bank sponsors;
•
harm to our business or reputation resulting from negative publicity;
•
exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities;
•
additional operating and development costs; or
•
diversion of management, technical or other resources, among other consequences.
To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or adversely impact the deployment of our solutions, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
If we are unable to improve our margin, in particular within Marketing Technology Solutions, we may experience lower aggregate profitability and margins.
While we have experienced significant revenue growth across our offering of solutions and services, certain solutions and services, such as our Marketing Technology Solutions, have lower margins as compared to our subscription and transaction fee services, such as our vertical Business Management Software and integrated payment solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, subscription and transaction fees and Marketing Technology Solutions generated 78.5% and 18.5%, respectively, of our total revenues. To the extent our lower margin solutions and services grow as a portion of our overall business, there is an adverse impact on our aggregate profitability and margins.
In addition, we may be unable to achieve satisfactory prices for our offerings or maintain prices at competitive levels across our offering of solutions and services. If we are unable to maintain our prices, or if our costs increase and we are unable to offset such an increase with a commensurate increase in our prices, our margins could decline. We will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressure and expect that we will continue to experience growth across our offerings, including in respect of our lower margin solutions, such as our Marketing Technology Solutions, which will likely have a material adverse effect on our margins.
A future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the business or operations of third parties with whom we conduct business.
Potential future pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious disease may cause significant economic and financial market uncertainty and disruption and measures to contain infection may negatively impact SMBs and our operations. To the extent a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.
Conversely, pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks may significantly and temporarily increase demand in certain industries and markets in which we operate. For example, COVID-19 generally increased demand for, and utilization of, telehealth services, and increased demand from customers shifting to technology-focused, digital-first business models. While such increases may help to offset the decline of business and demand in other industries, there can be no assurance that these levels of interest, demand and use will be similar in any future public health crisis. Federal and state budget shortfalls as a result of a public health crisis could lead to potential reductions in funding for Medicare and Medicaid. Further reductions in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid could lead to our Health Services customers postponing expenditures on information technology and related services.
It is possible that the increased prevalence of remote or hybrid work arrangements may also result in consumer and patient privacy, IT security and fraud risks.
I-23
We are subject to economic and political risk, the business cycles of our clients and changes in the overall level of consumer and commercial spending, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States, or increases in interest rates, could adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or aggregate volume of transactions made using electronic payments and increasing interest payments on our debt. A reduction in the amount of consumer or commercial spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits. If our customers make fewer purchases or sales of products and services using electronic payments, or consumers spend less money through electronic payments, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts, resulting in lower revenue.
While we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions, any significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region can impact our business and that of our customers. These factors may make it difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities; neither we nor our customers can predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic downturn or subsequent recovery. Furthermore, if a significant portion of our customers are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry, our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries. These factors may also cause our customers to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased and otherwise slow their spending on our services. In addition, due to these conditions, many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. These conditions and factors may reduce the demand for our services and solutions, and more generally may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Similarly, new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied, which may decrease customer spending and increase our costs.
A weakening in the economy could have a negative impact on our customers, as well as the customers they serve who purchase solutions and services using the payment processing systems to which we provide access, which could, in turn, negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our clients are SMBs. To continue to grow our revenue, we must add new SMB customers, sell additional solutions and services to existing SMB customers and encourage existing SMB customers to continue doing business with us. However, a weakening in the economy could force SMBs to close at higher than historical rates in part because many of them are not as well capitalized as larger organizations and are typically less able to make technology-related decisions based on factors other than price, which could expose us to potential credit losses and future transaction declines. Further, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices. We also have a certain amount of fixed and semi-fixed costs, including rent, debt service and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy.
General inflation, including wage inflation, increases in interest rates, currency volatility as well as monetary, fiscal and policy interventions by national or regional governments in anticipation of or reaction to such events could have negative impacts on our business by increasing our operating costs and our borrowing costs as well as decreasing the capital available for our customers to purchase our solutions and services or the levels of cash we maintain for working capital. The change in the United States presidential administration may result in economic volatility or other consequences that adversely impact SMBs or consumer spending and consequently negatively impact our business and results of operations.
We currently manage our exchange rate and interest rate risk using hedging instruments. We cannot be certain such practices will be available and/or effective at mitigating foreign currency and interest rate risk to which we are exposed. If we are unsuccessful in detecting material exposures in a timely manner, any hedging strategies we deploy are not effective, or there are no hedging strategies available for certain exposures that are prudent given the associated risks and the potential mitigation of the underlying exposure achieved, our operating results or financial position could be adversely affected in the future.
If we are unable to retain our personnel and hire additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.
Our future success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled employees and contract workers, particularly our management team, sales and marketing personnel, professional services personnel and software engineers. Any of our key personnel have worked for us for a significant amount of time or were recruited by us specifically due to their experience. Our success depends in part upon the reputation and influence within the industry of our senior managers who have, over the years, developed long standing and favorable relationships with our vendors, card associations, bank sponsors and other payment processing and service providers. Each of our executive officers and other key employees may terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or members of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Remer, our President, Matthew Feierstein and our Chief Financial Officer, Ryan Siurek, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business or development objectives and could materially harm our business. Further, contractual 
I-24
obligations related to confidentiality and assignment of intellectual property rights may be ineffective or unenforceable, and departing employees may share our proprietary information with competitors in ways that could adversely impact us.
In addition, certain senior management personnel are substantially vested in their stock option grants or other equity compensation. While we periodically grant additional equity awards to management personnel and other key employees to provide additional incentives to remain employed by us, employees may be more likely to leave us if a significant portion of their equity compensation is fully vested.
We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous other technology companies. Often, significant amounts of time and resources are required to train technical personnel and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational and managerial requirements, on a timely basis or at all, and we have paid and may in the future be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so, including as a result of wage inflation. Because of the technical nature of our solutions and services and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, as well as our contract workers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sales or successfully develop new solutions, client and consulting services and enhancements of existing solutions and services. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information.
We may be unsuccessful in achieving our objectives through acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions.
Since April 2017, we have consummated 53 acquisitions and have generated significant growth through acquisitions. Although we expect to continue to acquire companies and other assets in the future, such acquisitions pose a number of challenges and risks, including the following:
•
the ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional assets at attractive valuations and on favorable terms;
•
the availability of suitable acquisition candidates;
•
the ability to compete successfully for identified acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business;
•
higher than expected or unanticipated acquisition costs;
•
effective integration and management of acquired businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition, due to difficulties such as incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems;
•
retention of an acquired company’s key employees or customers;
•
contingent or undisclosed liabilities, incompatibilities and/or other obstacles to successful integration not discovered during the pre-acquisition due diligence process;
•
the availability of management resources to evaluate acquisition candidates and oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses;
•
the ability to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions;
•
increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets;
•
significant dilution to our stockholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; and
•
the ability to generate cash necessary to execute our acquisition strategy and/or the reduction of cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or for other purposes.
While our acquisition strategy leverages our experience and utilizes internal criteria for evaluating acquisition candidates and prospective businesses, there can be no guarantee that each business will have all of the positive attributes we seek. If we complete an acquisition that does not meet some or all of our criteria, such acquisition may not be as successful as one involving a business that does meet most or all of our criteria. There can be no assurance that our criteria are accurate or helpful indicators of success, and we may fail or opt not to acquire successful businesses that do not otherwise satisfy our internal requirements and preferences. In addition, we may consider acquisitions outside of our existing vertical markets and in industries or services in which we have limited expertise or experience. While we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular acquisition candidate, there can be no assurance that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors to such new markets, industries or services.
Even if we are able to complete acquisitions and other investments, such activities may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our strategic goals and could be viewed negatively by existing or prospective customers, investors or other 
I-25
stakeholders. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions or other investments in the time frame expected or at all. For example, the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel. Further, acquisitions and consolidations may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business. Acquisitions can also result in a complex corporate structure with different systems and procedures in place across various acquired entities, particularly during periods in which acquired entities are being integrated or transitioned to our preferred systems and procedures. Initiatives to integrate these disparate systems and procedures can be challenging and costly, and the risk of failure high.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the future, or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms, our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting expected financial benefits.
The occurrence of any of these factors may result in a decrease in any or all acquisition activity and otherwise adversely impact our operations, which may lead to less growth and a deterioration of our financial and operational condition.
In addition, we may pursue dispositions and other strategic transactions, which could be material. For example, we have announced a strategic review of our Marketing Technology Solutions, which may not result in a successful sale or other dispositions. Dispositions and other strategic transactions may not have the anticipated impact on our business, may negatively impact revenues and may make it difficult to generate cash flows to meet our cash requirements.
Revenues and profits generated through acquisitions may be less than anticipated, and we may fail to uncover all liabilities of acquisition targets through the due diligence process prior to an acquisition, resulting in unanticipated costs, losses or a decline in profits, as well as potential impairment charges. Claims against us relating to any acquisition may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller’s indemnification obligations.
In evaluating and determining the purchase price for a prospective acquisition, we estimate the future revenues and profits from that acquisition based largely on historical financial performance. Following an acquisition, we may experience some attrition in the number of clients serviced by an acquired provider of billing and payment solutions and marketing and customer retention services. Should the rate of post-acquisition client attrition exceed the rate we forecasted, the revenues and profits from the acquisition may be less than we estimated, which could result in losses or a decline in profits, as well as potential impairment charges. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, including our revenue or return on investment assumptions, may not be realized.
We perform a due diligence review of each of our acquisition targets. This due diligence review, however, may not adequately uncover all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the proposed acquisition, exposing us to potentially significant, unanticipated costs, as well as potential impairment charges. Although a seller generally may have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition or merger agreement, these obligations usually will be subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. Certain transactions are also subject to limitations of the scope of a Representation and Warranty Insurance policy. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities that we may incur. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our insurance does not cover all of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-insured retentions and deductibles under our insurance. Although we believe we have sufficient reserves for contingencies, a judgment may be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured or which exceed the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and competitive position.
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $135.8 million, $190.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our New Revolver (as defined in Part II. Item 7. 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition 
- 
Liquidity and Capital Resources”)
 and $532.1 million outstanding under our Credit Facilities (as defined in Part II. Item 7. 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition 
- 
Liquidity and Capital Resources”)
. To service this debt and any additional debt we may incur in the future, we need to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash is subject, to a certain extent, to our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, including acquisition activity, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings or other financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs. To the extent we are required to use our cash flow from operations or the proceeds of any future financing to service our debt instead of funding working capital, capital 
I-26
expenditures, acquisition activity or other general corporate purposes, we will be less able to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, industry and in the economy generally. This will place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that the terms of that debt will allow any of the above alternative measures or that these measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to repay or refinance our debt on favorable terms, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the value of our outstanding debt. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.
In addition, the terms of our Credit Facilities contain, and any agreements evidencing or governing other future debt may contain, certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to engage in certain activities that are in our long-term best interests and align with our business strategies or operations, including our ability to:
•
incur liens on property, assets or revenues;
•
incur or assume additional debt or amend our debt and other material agreements;
•
declare or make distributions and redeem or repurchase equity interests or issue preferred stock;
•
prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;
•
make investments;
•
engage in certain business activities; and
•
engage in certain mergers and asset sales.
In addition, under certain circumstances, we will be required to satisfy and maintain a specified financial ratio under the terms of our Credit Facilities. While we have not previously breached and are not in breach of any of these covenants, there can be no guarantee that we will not breach these covenants in the future. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events and factors beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the terms of our indebtedness. An event of default would permit the lending banks to take certain actions, including terminating all outstanding commitments and declaring all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, including all outstanding borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts owing or payable with respect to such borrowings and any terminated commitments. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral we granted to them, which includes substantially all of our assets. If payment of outstanding amounts under our Credit Facilities accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such amounts in full, and our common stockholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.
As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. It may require significant resources and management oversight to maintain and, if necessary, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which would increase our costs and expenses.
As a public company, we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on the effectiveness of 
I-27
our internal control over financial reporting, provided that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date (i) we are either an “accelerated filer” or a “large accelerated filer,” each as defined in the Exchange Act, and (ii) we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management’s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. We are also required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff.
We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 that has not been remediated as of December 31, 2024, as described in Part II, Item 9A. The material weakness identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates to the lack of properly designed controls over certain of our order to cash revenue accounting processes. Specifically, adequate controls are not in place primarily as a result of (a) the lack of full system integration for certain of our order to cash systems and (b) control deficiencies within the manual controls designed to mitigate that risk. We have also previously identified a material weakness over internal control over financial reporting in the past.
In addition to taking remediation measures in response to the current material weakness we identified, we may need to expend additional resources and provide additional management oversight in order to establish effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our employees, entail substantial costs, take a significant period of time to complete or divert management’s attention from other business concerns. 
The material weakness will not be considered remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. At this time, we cannot predict the success of such efforts or the outcome of our assessment of the remediation efforts. We can give no assurance that our efforts will remediate this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and cause a decline in the price of our common stock. Additionally, ineffective internal control could expose us to an increased risk of financial reporting fraud and the misappropriation of assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list or to other regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.
In addition, as we continue to scale and improve our operations, including our internal systems and processes, we are currently implementing, and in the future may seek to implement, a variety of critical systems, such as billing, human resource information systems, financial reporting and accounting systems. We cannot assure you that new systems, including any increases in scale or related improvements, will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available to facilitate and manage these processes. Failure to implement necessary systems and procedures, transition to new systems and processes or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs, compromised internal reporting and processes and system errors or failures. The implementation and transition to any new critical system may be disruptive to our business if they do not work as planned or if we experience issues related to such implementation or transition, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.
In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) to offset future taxable income. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if there is a future change in our stock ownership (which may be outside of our control) that results in an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, or pre-2017 NOLs, are subject to expiration while U.S. federal and certain state NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, or post- 2017 NOLs, are not subject to expiration. Additionally, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, the deductibility of federal post-2017 NOLs is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL for such post-2017 NOLs. For these and other reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs. 
I-28
Government healthcare regulation, healthcare industry standards and other requirements create risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies within Health Services.
The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequently changing laws, regulations and industry standards. These laws and regulations may impact us directly or indirectly through our contracts with Health Services customers. Many healthcare laws and regulations are complex, and their application to specific solutions, services and relationships may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare IT solutions and services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our solutions and services in ways that we do not anticipate. In addition, federal and state efforts to reform or revise aspects of the healthcare industry or to revise or create additional legal or regulatory requirements could impact our operations, the use of our solutions and our ability to market new solutions, or could create unexpected liabilities for us. There can be no assurance that our business or operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives.
Scrutiny on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could increase our costs, harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results.
Companies are subject to scrutiny by multiple stakeholders on climate change, human capital management, and a variety of other environmental, social and other sustainability (“ESG”) matters. Expectations regarding ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs, compliance or disclosure obligations, or other impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
While we may, from time to time, engage in certain voluntary initiatives (which may include disclosures, policies, and targets, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our operations and/or products or respond to stakeholder considers, such initiatives may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Expectations around companies’ management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. In particular, we may make statements or actions based on various frameworks, methodologies, or data that we believe to be reasonable but which may ultimately be determined to be erroneous or inconsistent with future regulatory requirements or best practices. Even if this is not the case, our current actions may subsequently be determined to be insufficient or not aligned to best practices by various stakeholders. If we are not effective in addressing ESG matters affecting our business, or setting and meeting relevant sustainability goals, we may be subject to various adverse impacts, including reputational damage and potential stakeholder engagement and/or litigation.
In addition, this emphasis on ESG matters has resulted and may result in the adoption of new laws and regulations, including new reporting requirements. For example, various policymakers, such as the SEC, European Union and State of California, have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for companies to provide significantly expanded disclosures on, or take other actions regarding climate and/or other ESG topics. These requirements are not uniform across jurisdictions, and may be inconsistently applied, which can increase the complexity and cost of compliance, and increase the risk of enforcement or litigation relating to our ESG disclosures and initiatives. Moreover, some investors and financial institutions use ESG or sustainability scores, ratings or benchmarks to make financing, investment and voting decisions. Any reputational damage associated with ESG factors may also adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain employees, customers, and business partners. Simultaneously, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce companies’ efforts relating to certain ESG-related matters. Both advocates and opponents to certain ESG matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such activism, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and other stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified in this risk factor. Such ESG matters may also impact our suppliers, customers, capital providers, and other stakeholders, which may compound or cause new impacts on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce, and we may incur significant costs in enforcing or defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
Our success depends in part on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. However, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take to protect and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights will be successful. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our third-party licensors, and any of these claims or actions may result in restrictions on our use of our intellectual property or the conduct of our business. Our intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain service offerings or other 
I-29
competitive harm. Others, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our solutions and services, design around or reverse engineer our intellectual property, and in such cases neither we nor our third-party licensors may be able to assert intellectual property rights against such parties. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely on, certain services and intellectual property that we license from third parties for use in our product offerings and services. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others or that our suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the third-party technology incorporated into our platform in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Further, our contractual license arrangements may be subject to termination or renegotiation with unfavorable terms to us, and our third-party licensors may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other adverse business dynamics, any of which might affect our ability to use and exploit the products licensed to us by these third-party licensors. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights (including litigation against our third-party licensors), which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete.
Further, existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection and the laws of other countries in which we market our software solutions and services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. Therefore, our intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the U.S.
We may be subject to patent, trademark and other intellectual property infringement claims, which may be time-consuming, and cause us to incur significant liability and increase our costs of doing business.
We cannot be certain that our products and services and the operation of our business do not, or will not, infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future solutions, including for patent infringement, breach of copyright, trademark, license usage or other intellectual property rights. There may be existing patents or patent applications of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business; many patent applications are filed confidentially in the United States and are not published until 18 months following the applicable filing date. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have been purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. Even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees. In addition, the outcome of litigation is uncertain, and any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign or reengineer our affected solutions or services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly royalties, license fees or damage awards for which we may not have insurance, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our solutions or services. Even if we have an agreement for indemnification against such costs, the indemnifying party, if any in such circumstances, may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be materially and adversely affected.
We may be subject to claims asserting that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.
Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual’s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.
In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the creation or development of intellectual property on our behalf to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in having all such employees and contractors execute such an agreement. The assignment of intellectual property may not be self-executing or the assignment agreement may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against employees or third parties or defend claims that they may bring against us to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our use of “open source” software could adversely affect our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation.
We may use open source software in connection with the development and deployment of our solutions and services, and we expect to continue to use open source software in the future. Companies that use open source software in connection with their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a 
I-30
result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing or linked to open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code, which could include valuable proprietary code of the user, on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous and almost none of them have been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.
Further, in addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software carries greater technical and legal risks than does the use of third-party commercial software. For example, open source software is generally provided without any support or warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement or the quality of the code, including the existence of security vulnerabilities. To the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of open source software, any undetected errors or defects in open source software that we use could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our systems and injure our reputation. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Regulation
We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer and user bases, and thereby decrease our revenue.
Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and various state, local and foreign agencies. We collect personally identifiable information and other data from our customers and the end-customers they serve and use this information to provide services to such customers and end-customers, as well as to support, expand and improve our business.
U.S. and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use and dissemination of data, through websites or otherwise, and as regulating the presentation of website content. However, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. At the state level, lawmakers continue to pass new laws concerning privacy and data security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “CCPA”) requires covered businesses that process the personal information of California residents to, among other things: (i) provide certain disclosures to California residents regarding the business’s collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information; (ii) receive and respond to requests from California residents to access, delete, and correct their personal information, or to opt out of certain disclosures of their personal information; and (iii) enter into specific contractual provisions with service providers that process California resident personal information on the business’s behalf.
Similar laws have passed in other states, and are continuing to be proposed at the state and federal level. Recent and new state and federal legislation relating to privacy may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs, could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.
HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on “covered entities,” including certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as their covered subcontractors. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, whether as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information (“PHI”), a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Additionally, if we or our subcontractor business associates fail to comply with HIPAA or contractual requirements, or are otherwise involved in a HIPAA data breach, we may face significant fines and penalties, ongoing compliance requirements, reputational harm, contractual reimbursement, recoupment or other obligations, FTC enforcement actions and private litigation brought by impacted individuals.
I-31
Furthermore, the FTC and many state Attorneys General continue to enforce federal and state consumer protection laws against companies for online collection, use, dissemination and security practices that appear to be unfair or deceptive. The FTC has authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities that make deceptive statements about privacy and data sharing in privacy policies, fail to limit third-party use of personal health information, fail to implement policies to protect personal health information or engage in other unfair practices that harm customers. For example, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure can constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by FTC and state Attorneys General to regulate the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.
Outside of the United States, many jurisdictions have laws or regulations dealing with the collection, use, sharing, or other processing of personal information, including laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Canada, Middle East, Australia and South America. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), in the EEA and its equivalent in the United Kingdom (“UK”, and such equivalent, the “UK GDPR”), impose a strict data protection compliance regime (which will continue to be interpreted through guidance and decisions over the coming years. Failure to comply with these laws could result fines of up to the greater of €20 million ($22 million / £17 million) or 4% of global turnover, stop processing orders, or civil litigation.
Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EEA, and the United States remains uncertain. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) states that reliance on the standard contractual clauses - a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism - alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. We expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue. As a result, we may have to make certain operational changes and we will have to implement revised standard contractual clauses and other relevant documentation for existing data transfers within required time frames.
Privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations, and any other such changes or new laws or regulations, could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct. In addition, any such changes could compromise our ability to develop an adequate marketing strategy and pursue our growth strategy effectively, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The interpretations and measures conducted by us in our efforts to comply with the applicable data protection laws may have been or may prove to be insufficient or incorrect. If our privacy or data security measures or practices fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to claims, legal proceedings or other actions by individuals or governmental authorities based on privacy or data protection regulations and our commitments to customers and users, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may also be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our customers and users’ ability to use and share personal information or our ability to store, process and share personal information, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.
The regulatory framework governing the use of AI Technologies is rapidly evolving, and we cannot predict how future legislation and regulation will impact our ability to offer products or services that we develop which leverage AI Technologies.
We use AI Technologies throughout our business and are making significant investments in this area. The regulatory framework for AI Technologies is rapidly evolving as many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of our AI Technologies. As a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, or standards may have on our business and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations.
Already, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI Technologies, and new laws regulating AI Technologies are expected to enter into force in the United States and the EU in 2024. In the United States, the Biden administration issued a broad Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (the “2023 AI Order”) that sets out principles intended to guide AI design and deployment for the public and private sector and signals the increase in governmental involvement and regulation over AI Technologies. The 2023 AI Order established certain new requirements for the training, testing and cybersecurity of sophisticated AI models and large-scale compute centers used to train AI models. The 2023 AI Order also instructed several other federal agencies to promulgate additional regulations within specific 
I-32
timeframes from the date of the 2023 AI Order regarding the use and development of AI Technologies. Legislation related to AI Technologies has also been introduced at the federal level and is advancing at the state level.
In Europe, on May 21, 2024, the European Union legislators approved the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the “EU AI Act”), which establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The EU AI Act, as well as developing interpretation and application of the GDPR in respect of automated decision making, together with developing guidance and/or decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI Technologies and our ability to provide, improve or commercialize our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, and result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.
It is possible that further new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in other non-U.S. jurisdictions, or that existing laws and regulations, including competition and antitrust laws, may be interpreted in ways that would limit our ability to use AI Technologies for our business, or require us to change the way we use AI Technologies in a manner that negatively affects the performance of our products, services, and business and the way in which we use AI Technologies. We may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services in certain jurisdictions if the laws, regulations, or decisions are not consistent across jurisdictions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws, regulations, or decisions and/or guidance interpreting existing laws could be significant and would increase our operating expenses (such as by imposing additional reporting obligations regarding our use of AI Technologies). Such an increase in operating expenses, as well as any actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Through our relationships with third parties, including payment processors such as Worldpay, we must comply with certain laws. Our failure to comply could materially harm our business.
The local, state and federal laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes and industry standards that govern our business include, or may in the future include, those relating to underwriting, foreign exchange, payments services (such as money transmission), anti-money laundering, combating terrorist financing, escheatment, international sanctions regimes and other applicable rules, regulations, and laws.
As we expand into new jurisdictions, the number of foreign laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes and standards governing our business will expand as well. In addition, as our business and solutions continue to develop and expand, we may become subject to additional laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes and standards. We may not always be able to accurately predict the scope or applicability of certain laws, rules, regulations, licensing schemes, or standards to our business, particularly as we expand into new areas of operations, which could have a significant negative effect on our existing business and our ability to pursue future plans.
Evaluation of our compliance efforts, as well as the questions of whether and to what extent our solutions and services could be considered money transmission, are matters of regulatory interpretation and could change over time. We have taken the position that in all cases where we do not participate in the authorization of transactions, flow of funds or settlement of funds, that a solution or service does not meet the definition of a “money service business” under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 USC 5311 (and therefore we are not subject to the requirements set forth in the BSA and its implementing regulations). In the future, if regulators disagree with our position with respect to money transmission or other potentially applicable laws, including those related to money transmission, or if new guidance or interpretations thereof are issued, we could be subject to investigations and resulting liability, including governmental fines, restrictions on our business, or other sanctions, and we could be forced to cease conducting certain aspects of our business with residents of certain jurisdictions, be forced to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, or be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals, including state money transmitter licenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses, and, even if we were able to do so, there could be substantial costs and potential changes to our solutions or services involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, capitalization, corporate governance, or other requirements of such licenses. These factors could impose substantial additional costs, involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our solutions or services, require significant and costly operational changes, or prevent us from providing our solutions or services in any given market.
If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations with respect to government contracts, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties.
We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which affect how we conduct business with certain governmental entities. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs. Any non-compliance could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties, including contractual damages, and impact our ability to obtain additional business in the future. Our governmental entity clients periodically review our compliance with their contracts and our performance under the terms of such contracts. If we fail to comply with these contracts, laws and 
I-33
regulations, we may also suffer harm to our reputation, which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts.
Our sending of commercial emails and text messages and certain other telephonic services must comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and future legislation, regulatory actions, or litigation could adversely affect our business.
The United States regulates marketing by telephone and email and the laws and regulations governing the use of emails and telephone calls for marketing purposes continue to evolve, and changes in technology, the marketplace or consumer preferences may lead to the adoption of additional laws or regulations or changes in interpretation of existing laws or regulations. New laws or regulations, or changes to the manner in which existing laws and regulations or interpreted or enforced, may further restrict our ability to contact potential and existing customers by phone and email and could render us unable to communicate with consumers in a cost-effective fashion. For example, in the United States, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the “CAN-SPAM Act”), among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender.
In addition, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”) is a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls and faxes. Since its inception, the TCPA’s purview has extended to certain text messages sent to consumers. We must ensure that our services, including those that leverage text messaging, comply with the TCPA, including its implementing regulations and agency guidance. The scope and interpretation of the TCPA is continuously evolving and developing. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures compliant with the TCPA, a court or the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), as the agency that implements and enforces the TCPA, may disagree with our interpretation of the TCPA and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance.
Failure to comply with obligations and restrictions related to telephone, text message and email marketing could subject us to lawsuits, fines, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity and other losses that could harm our business. In addition, we provide certain services to our customers that involve text messaging that could be deemed to be automated dialing systems subject to restrictions under the TCPA. Consumers may bring, and have in the past brought, suit against us under the TCPA based on our services or our customers’ use of our services.
In particular, determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services or our customers’ use of our services violate the TCPA could subject us to civil damages and penalties, could invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, could require us to refund portions of our services fees and could have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by consumers or regulatory authorities to our services could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us. In addition, any uncertainty regarding whether and how the TCPA applies to our business could increase our costs, limit our ability to grow, and have an adverse effect on our business.
We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business.
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption laws. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public sector. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. As we increase our international cross-border business and expand operations abroad, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. As we increase our international business, our risks under these laws may increase.
Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties, injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas are received or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.
I-34
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated at the local, state and federal levels. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us or our customers, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.
As one of our three key verticals is Health Services, our operations and relationships, and those of our customers, are regulated by a number of federal, state and local governmental entities. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and laws, regulations and industry standards are constantly evolving due to the changing political, legislative and regulatory landscapes. There are a significant number of wide-ranging healthcare laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below, that may be directly or indirectly applicable to our operations and relationships or the business practices of our clients. Healthcare laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. Any failure of our solutions or services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal liability and could, among other things, adversely affect demand for our services, invalidate all or portions of some of our contracts with our customers, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our revenue, cause us to be disqualified from serving customers doing business with government payers and give our customers the right to terminate our contracts with them, any one of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Healthcare Fraud
. A number of federal and state laws, including the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims, such as the False Claims Act apply to healthcare providers and others that provide, offer, solicit or receive payments to induce or reward referrals of items or services for which payment may be made under any federal or state healthcare program and, under certain state laws, any third-party payor. These laws are complex and their application to our specific services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have recently increased fraud and abuse enforcement activities, including in the healthcare IT industry. Additionally, from time to time, participants in the healthcare industry receive inquiries or subpoenas to produce documents in connection with government investigations.
In addition, our solutions and services include electronically transmitting claims for services and items rendered by providers to payers for approval and reimbursement. We also provide revenue cycle management services to our clients that include the coding, preparation, submission and collection of claims for medical service to payers for reimbursement. Such claims are governed by U.S. federal and state laws. The federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes civil penalties on any persons that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, a false or fraudulent claim to a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid. U.S. federal law may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims. Further, the FCA contains a whistleblower provision that allows a private individual to file a lawsuit on behalf of the U.S. government and entitles that whistleblower to a percentage of any recoveries. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. We may be subject to government investigations, and if our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any investigation or proceeding related to these laws, even if unwarranted or without merit, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Security and Privacy of Health-Related Information
. Federal, state and local laws regulate the privacy and security of health-related information and the circumstances under which such health-related information may be used, disclosed, transmitted and maintained. For example, HIPAA regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. The privacy and security regulations promulgated under HIPAA regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, and impose privacy and security requirements on covered entities and their business associates. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies with respect to the protection of, use and disclosure of PHI, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect electronic PHI and certain notification requirements in the event of a data breach. The Company’s operations could be negatively impacted by a violation of the HIPAA privacy, security or breach notification rules. Additionally, if the Company or any of its downstream / subcontractor business associates fails to comply with HIPAA or contractual requirements, or create or are otherwise involved in a HIPAA data breach, the Company may face significant fines and penalties, ongoing compliance requirements, reputational harm, contractual reimbursement, recoupment or other obligations and private litigation brought by impacted individuals.
Promoting Interoperability Programs and Health IT Certification. 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing our use of health record technology. While a combination of our solutions has been certified as meeting standards for certified electronic health record technology, the regulatory standards to achieve certification will continue to evolve over time. We may incur increased development 
I-35
costs and delays in delivering solutions if we need to upgrade our software or healthcare devices to be in compliance with these varying and evolving standards. In addition, further delays in interpreting these standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our clients’ decisions to purchase our software solutions. If our software solutions are not compliant with these evolving standards, our relationships with current customers, market position and sales could be impaired and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our software solutions.
Information Blocking and Interoperability Rules
. Federal rules implementing the 21st Century Cures Act require developers of certified EHRs and health IT products to adopt standardized application programming interfaces, which help individuals to securely and easily access structured and unstructured electronic health information formats using smartphones and other mobile devices. These rules create a potentially lengthy list of certification and maintenance of certification requirements that developers of EHRs and other health IT products must meet in order to maintain approved federal government certification status. Meeting and maintaining this certification status could require additional development costs. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, HHS has the regulatory authority to investigate and assess civil monetary penalties against health IT developers and/or providers found to be guilty of “information blocking.” Any failure to comply with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors.
The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and results of operations;
•
the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;
•
failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
•
announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, results of operations or capital commitments;
•
changes in stock market valuations and operating performance of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;
•
price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;
•
changes in our board of directors or management;
•
sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by certain affiliates of Providence Strategic Growth, Silver Lake or our executive officers and directors;
•
lawsuits threatened or filed against us;
•
anticipated or actual changes in laws, regulations or government policies applicable to our business;
•
changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;
•
short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;
•
general economic conditions in the United States;
•
other events or factors, including those resulting from war (including the ongoing war in Ukraine), pandemics or other public health crises, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and
•
the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of companies have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to their results of operations. Market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of shares of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of your investment. Price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of shares of our common stock is low. Furthermore, in the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
I-36
The parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement hold a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, and such parties interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders.
The parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement own approximately 83.0% of our common stock. We have agreed to nominate to our board of directors individuals designated by Providence Strategic Growth and Silver Lake in accordance with the sponsor stockholders agreement. Providence Strategic Growth and Silver Lake each retain the right to designate directors for so long as they beneficially own at least 5% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, for so long as Providence Strategic Growth and Silver Lake collectively beneficially own at least 30% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding, certain actions by us or any of our subsidiaries require the prior written consent of each of Providence Strategic Growth and Silver Lake so long as such stockholder is entitled to designate at least two (2) directors for nomination to our board of directors. The actions that require prior written consent include: (i) change in control transactions, (ii) acquiring or disposing of assets or any business enterprise or division thereof for consideration in excess of $500.0 million in any single transaction or series of transactions, (iii) increasing or decreasing the size of our board of directors, (iv) terminating the employment of our chief executive officer or hiring a new chief executive officer, (v) initiating any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries and (vi) any transfer, issue, issuance, sale or disposition of any shares of common stock, other equity securities, equity-linked securities or securities that are convertible into equity securities of us or our subsidiaries to any person or entity that is a non-strategic financial investor in a private placement transaction or series of transactions.
Even when the parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement cease to own shares of our stock representing a majority of the total voting power, for so long as the parties to such agreement continue to own a significant percentage of our stock, they will still be able to significantly influence or effectively control the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval through their voting power. In addition, pursuant to the sponsor stockholder agreement, we are generally required to obtain the prior written consent of the parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement before we or our subsidiaries undertake certain actions. Accordingly, for such period of time, the parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement have significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies. In particular, for so long as the parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement continue to own a significant percentage of our stock, the parties to such agreement may be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our board of directors, and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our Company. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.
Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply with respect to certain parties to our stockholders agreements or their affiliates (other than us and our subsidiaries), and any of their respective principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees or other representatives (other than any such person who is also our employee or an employee of our subsidiaries), or any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries. See “-Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply with respect to certain parties to our stockholders agreements and any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.”
Substantial future sales by the parties to our stockholders agreements or other holders of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the price of our common stock.
The parties to our stockholders agreements collectively own approximately 88.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition to the limitations on the sale and transfer of shares of common stock held by such stockholders as set forth in the stockholders agreements, subject to the restrictions described in the paragraph below, future sales of these shares in the public market will be subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, for so long as such parties are deemed to be our affiliates, unless the shares to be sold are registered with the SEC. These stockholders are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares. We are unable to predict with certainty whether or when such parties will sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock. The sale by the parties to our stockholders agreements of a substantial number of shares, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.
We filed registration statements on Form S-8 registering under the Securities Act the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our incentive plan. If equity securities granted under our incentive plan are sold or it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital.
I-37
We are a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.
Certain affiliates of Providence Strategic Growth and Silver Lake own approximately 83.0% of our common stock and are parties, among others, to the sponsor stockholders agreement. The parties to the sponsor stockholders agreement have agreed to vote, or cause to vote, all of their outstanding shares of our common stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders in which directors are elected, so as to cause the election of the director nominees designated by each party. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:
•
the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors; 
•
the requirement that its director nominations be made, or recommended to the full board of directors, by its independent directors or by a nominations committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors and that it adopt a written charter or board resolution addressing the nominations process; and
•
the requirement that it have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.
We rely on certain of the exemptions, namely the requirement that director nominations be made, or recommended, by the independent directors or by a nominations committee comprised entirely of independent directors. As long as we remain a “controlled company,” we may elect in the future to take advantage of any of these exemptions. As a result of any such election, our board of directors would not have a majority of independent directors, our compensation committee would not consist entirely of independent directors and our directors would not be nominated or selected by independent directors. Accordingly, you do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the rules of Nasdaq.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or they publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or publish negative views on us or our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.
We are an “emerging growth company” and our compliance with the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies” may make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These provisions include, but are not limited to: being exempt from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; being exempt from any rules that could be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor’s report on financial statements; being subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and not being required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or on any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
In addition, while we are an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to comply with any new financial accounting standard until such standard is generally applicable to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that are not “emerging growth companies” or elect not to avail themselves of this provision.
We may remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as December 31, 2026, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, though we may cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier under certain circumstances, including if (i) we have more than $1.235 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (ii) we become a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year or (iii) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. The exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.
I-38
We incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.
As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act contains significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as “say on pay” and proxy access. Emerging growth companies are permitted to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the IPO. We intend to take advantage of this legislation for as long as we are permitted to do so. Once we become required to implement these requirements, we will incur additional compliance-related expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.
We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs adversely impact our net income or net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our solutions or services. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.
In addition, public company reporting and disclosure obligations may lead to threatened or actual litigation from time to time. If such claims are successful, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them and the diversion of management resources, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.
Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:
•
amendments to certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amendments to our amended and restated bylaws generally require the approval of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock;
•
our staggered board;
•
at any time when the parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, our stockholders may take action by consent without a meeting, and at any time when the parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than the majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, our stockholders may not take action by written consent, but may only take action at a meeting of stockholders;
•
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;
•
vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders, subject to the rights granted pursuant to the stockholders agreements;
•
a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or a majority of our board of directors;
•
unless we otherwise consent in writing, restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware or the federal courts, as applicable;
•
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and
I-39
•
advance notice procedures apply for stockholders (other than the parties to our stockholders agreements for nominations made pursuant to the terms of the stockholders agreements) to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.
In addition, we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, but our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested stockholder” (generally defined as any person who, together with that person’s affiliates and associates, owns, 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock) for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested stockholder” is prohibited, provided, however, that, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the parties to our sponsor stockholders agreement and their respective affiliates will not be deemed to be interested stockholders regardless of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock owned by them, and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.
These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided that the doctrine of “corporate opportunity” does not apply with respect to certain parties to our stockholders agreements and any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries.
The doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers or directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we renounce, to the fullest extent permitted by law and in accordance with Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law all interest and expectancy that we otherwise would be entitled to have in, and all rights to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any opportunity that may be presented to Providence Strategic Growth, Silver Lake or their affiliates (other than us and our subsidiaries), and any of their respective principals, members, directors, partners, stockholders, officers, employees or other representatives (other than any such person who is also our employee or an employee of our subsidiaries), or any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries. Providence Strategic Growth and Silver Lake or their affiliates and any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries, therefore, have no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, and have the right to either hold any corporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates’) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than us, including to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries. As a result, certain of our stockholders, directors and their respective affiliates are not prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We, therefore, may find ourselves in competition with certain of our stockholders, directors or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters and the federal district courts of the United States is the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, (A) (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended or restated) or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware; and (B) the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created 
I-40
by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Our decision to adopt such a federal forum provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that our federal forum provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of our federal forum provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision does not apply to claims seeking to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal court.
The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
General Risk Factors
Because we maintain and may expand our business that is located outside of the United States, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.
We maintain operations outside of the United States, including in Canada, the UK, Australia, Jordan and New Zealand, which we may expand in the future. Conducting and expanding international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These include:
•
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk;
•
difficulties in collecting payments internationally, and managing and staffing international operations;
•
establishing relationships with employees, independent contractors, subcontractors and suppliers in international locations;
•
the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international locations;
•
the burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws associated with international operations, including data privacy and security, taxes and customs;
•
significant fines, penalties and collateral consequences if we fail to comply with anti-bribery laws;
•
heightened risk of improper, unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies;
•
potentially adverse tax consequences, including in connection with repatriation of earnings;
•
increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•
political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and
•
reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.
We utilize and may in the future increase our utilization of independent contractors in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate, including India, Russia, Ukraine and Jordan. We currently depend on these independent contractors for certain software development activities. Our dependence on third-party contractors creates a number of risks, in particular, the risk that we may not maintain development quality, control, or effective management with respect to these business operations. In addition, poor relations between the United States and Russia, sanctions by the United States and the EU against Russia, ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Israel or the spreading or escalation of political tensions or economic instability in surrounding areas could have an adverse impact on our third-party software development in Russia, Ukraine and Jordan. In particular, increased tensions among the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia, including the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, could increase the threat of armed conflict, cyberwarfare and economic instability that could disrupt or delay the operations of our resources in Russia and Ukraine, disrupt or delay our communications with such resources or the flow of funds to support their operations, or otherwise render our resources unavailable.
I-41
Changes in accounting rules, assumptions and/or judgments could materially and adversely affect us.
Accounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our operations are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgment. These complexities could lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements. Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations or in our accounting assumptions and/or judgments could significantly impact our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
Litigation and the outcomes of such litigation could negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations.
We are, from time to time, subject to various litigation and legal proceedings. As a public company, we may be subject to proceedings across a variety of matters, including matters involving stockholder class actions, tax audits, unclaimed property audits and related matters, employment and others. For example, on January 31, 2024 plaintiff Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company, members of its Board of Directors (the “Board”) and the other parties to its sponsor stockholders agreement, dated June 30, 2021, Providence Strategic Growth II L.P., Providence Strategic Growth II-A L.P., Providence Strategic Growth III L.P., SLA Eclipse Co-Invest, L.P., and SLA CM Eclipse Holdings, L.P. (collectively, the “Sponsor Stockholders”), captioned 
Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust

v. Remer et. al
, Case No. 2024-0077-PAF (Del Ch.). The complaint generally alleges violations of Section 141(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) by providing the Sponsor Stockholders with an approval right over the Board’s ability to hire or fire the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Approval Right”) on the basis that it unlawfully limits the Board’s authority to manage the business and affairs of the Company. The plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment that the CEO Approval Right is invalid and void, and other declaratory and equitable relief for the class and/or the Company including attorneys’ and experts’ witness fees and other costs and expenses. On June 14, 2024, the Company filed its opening brief in support of its Motion to Dismiss, and on July 15, 2024, Plaintiff opposed that motion. On July 16, 2024, the court entered a stipulation and order dismissing the director defendants from the action. On August 29, 2024, the remaining defendants, the Company and Sponsor Stockholders (collectively, “Defendants”), filed their reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss, and pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply on September 26, 2024, which Defendants filed a response to on October 10, 2024. On October 15, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, arguing that the claims alleged are not ripe for adjudication and on November 15, 2024 Plaintiff opposed that motion. On December 9, 2024, Defendants filed their reply in support of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. On January 3, 2025, the Court entered a minute order deferring oral argument on the pending Motion to Dismiss until after the disposition of the appeal in 
Moelis & Company v. West Palm Beach Firefighters’ Pension Fund
, Case No. 340, 2024 (Del. Supr.).
The outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and the magnitude of potential losses therefrom, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Also, our insurance coverage may be insufficient, our assets may be insufficient to cover any amounts that exceed our insurance coverage, and we may have to pay damage awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such claims. Any such payments or settlement arrangements in current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Even if the plaintiffs’ claims are not successful, current or future litigation could result in substantial costs and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, and negatively affect the price of our common stock.
We may be subject to additional tax liabilities in connection with our operations or due to future legislation, each of which could materially impact our financial position and results of operation.
We are subject to federal and state income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, and such laws and rates vary by jurisdiction. We do not collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Similarly, non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed or proposed digital services taxes, including in connection with the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Project. These taxes, whether imposed unilaterally by non-U.S. jurisdictions or in response to multilateral measures (e.g., the “BEPS Project”), could result in taxation of companies that have customers in a particular jurisdiction but do not operate there through a permanent establishment. Changes to tax law or administration such as these, whether at the state level or the international level, could increase our tax administrative costs and tax risk and negatively affect our overall business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
I-42
Although we believe our tax practices and provisions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, there could be a material effect on our tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made, which could materially impact our financial results. In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period. Therefore, we may be subject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time. Further, any changes in the taxation of our activities, may increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, the United States government may enact significant changes to the taxation of business entities (such as the 2022 United States Inflation Reduction Act which, among other changes, introduced a 15% corporate minimum tax on certain United States corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain stock redemptions by United States corporations). We are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would on our business.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the terms of our existing Credit Agreement, and the expected terms of our Credit Facilities, restrict our ability to pay dividends, and any additional debt we may incur in the future may include similar restrictions. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.
We primarily depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund operations and expenses, including future dividend payments, if any.
We do not conduct significant business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to make future dividend payments, if any. We do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future; however, the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. See Part I, Item 2, “
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
.” The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could impair their ability to make distributions to us.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan.
We design and assess our program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the NIST CSF as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.
Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.
Our cybersecurity risk management program includes:
•
risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment;
•
a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;
•
the use of external service providers
, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;
I-43
•
cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; 
•
a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and
•
a third-party risk management process for certain service providers, suppliers, and vendors that have access to our critical systems and information.
We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
Cybersecurity Governance
Our board of directors (the “Board”) considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit

Committee (“Committee”) oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.

The Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.
The Committee reports to the full 
Board
 regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management program.

Board members receive presentations on relevant cybersecurity topics from our Senior Vice President of Security Operations and internal security staff.
Our management team, including our 
Chief Information Security Officer
 (CISO)/Senior Vice President of Information Technology and Security (SVP), is responsible for assessing and managing, and mitigating cyber risk and security threats. The Security team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both internal cybersecurity personnel and external cybersecurity consultants and contractors.
 The 
Security team members have diverse experience in security strategy, architecture, and operations. Additionally, the CISO/SVP has more than 30 years’ experience leading transformative security and technology. The CISO/SVP has earned the following certifications: Certified Information Systems Manager, Department of Homeland Security, Certified Incident Command, Certified Technical Emergency Response Training, Certified Incident Response, and the penetration testing team leader holds Offensive Security Certified Professional and Certified Red Team Operator certifications and the additional Security Operations team members hold a Security + certification
.
Our Security Operations team, in coordination with our legal and compliance teams, supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment. Our Security Operations team meets monthly with key executives and management to provide updates regarding the Company’s cybersecurity efforts. For more information, see the section titled 
“Risk Factor— Unauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification of data, disruption of our software or services or cyber breaches could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation and damage our reputation.”
