ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
We are subject to a number of risks potentially affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a company offering banking and other financial services, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make. We, therefore, encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. Our success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, capital risk, market risks, liquidity risks, cyber risk, interest rate risks, operational risks, model risks, technology, compliance, regulatory and legal risks, and strategic and reputational risks. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included in Part II, Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating whether to make or retain an investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The following risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that are not presently known or that we presently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Summary of Material Risk Factors
This section summarizes some of the risks potentially affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks and others are discussed in more detail further below in this section. You should consider this summary together with the more detailed information provided below.
There are various risks associated with our acquisition growth strategy, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
•
We may be unsuccessful in realizing the expected benefits of the Cambridge acquisition or other acquired businesses, including failure to retain key employees or customers, incurrence of unexpected difficulty or expense in integrating operations, technologies or customers, assumption of significant (and potentially unknown) liabilities, and inexperience with the products and/or geographies offered by the acquired business, all of which could divert our management’s attention and/or negatively impact our financial results.
•
When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. Under current accounting guidance, if we determine that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets.
•
We operate in a competitive market and may be unable to successfully identify additional acquisition opportunities or compete for attractive acquisition targets.
Various risks, including risks associated with changes in interest rates, loan losses, cybersecurity and regulatory compliance, are inherent in our business and our industry generally. 
•
Increases in interest rates have had and in the future may have a material adverse effect on many areas of our business, including net interest income, the earnings and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and loan delinquency, and increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
•
If our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.
•
The geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities in eastern Massachusetts and southern and coastal New Hampshire makes us vulnerable to a downturn in our local economy. 
•
We face security risks to our information databases, including information we maintain relating to our customers, as precautions taken by us and our vendors may not be completely effective to prevent unauthorized access, human error, phishing attacks or other events that could impact the security, reliability, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems or those of our vendors.
24
•
We operate in a highly competitive industry, and technological advances have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services, such as loans and payment services, that traditionally were banking products.
•
We may be unable to successfully execute on our strategic plan or performance targets, including through a failure to attract or retain the necessary highly skilled and qualified personnel. 
•
The fair value of our investments, including our securities portfolio, has declined due to increases in interest rates beginning in March 2022 and may decline further in the future. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale portfolio is recorded as other comprehensive income, which has the effect of reducing our shareholders’ equity and therefore our tangible book value per share, which is a metric many investors in our common stock consider.
•
Commercial loans, including those secured by commercial real estate, are generally riskier than other types of loans and constitute a significant portion of our loan and lease portfolio.
•
We face significant legal and regulatory risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us. 
•
Operational risk and losses can result from factors such as internal and external fraud; errors by employees or third parties; failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or utility outages; business continuity and data security system failures, including those encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems; or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls, including those of our suppliers or counterparties.
•
We may be adversely affected by weaknesses in financial institutions, the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States, market changes, or changes in equity markets.
•
We are subject to capital and liquidity standards that may change from time to time, and we may be unable to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.   
•
Our business is subject to extensive state and federal regulations, which often limit or restrict our activities and may impose material financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.
•
We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions, or could impede or materially delay our receipt of regulatory approval to acquire other companies.
•
We may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, which could include inadvertent or unintentional violations.
•
We may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators.
•
Our stock-based benefit plan, which we adopted in 2021, has increased and is expected to continue to increase our annual compensation and benefit expenses.
Certain provisions of our articles of organization, as well as state and federal banking laws, may make our stock a less attractive investment compared to the stock of peer companies.
•
Our articles of organization provide that state and federal courts located in Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes.
•
A beneficial holder of 10% or more of our shares is entitled to cast only one one-hundredth (1/100th) of a vote per share for each share in excess of the 10% threshold.

Risks potentially affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
You should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business, future operating results and financial condition, as well as the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. The following risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that are not presently known or that we presently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results 
25
of operations and business. Please refer to the note at the beginning of this section for important caveats related to the following risk factors.
Risks Related to Our Acquisition Strategy
The Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of Cambridge or other acquired businesses, particularly if the integration of the acquired businesses is more difficult than expected.
The Company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of Cambridge or other acquired businesses if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected. Furthermore, any number of unanticipated adverse occurrences for either the acquired business or the Company may cause us to fail to realize some or all of the expected benefits. The integration process, which is ongoing for Cambridge, could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Each of these issues might adversely affect the Company during the transition period, resulting in adverse effects on the Company following the merger. Additionally, our assumptions regarding the fair value of assets being acquired or projections of future benefits following the merger could prove to be inaccurate. As a result, revenues may be lower than expected or costs may be higher than expected and the overall benefits of the merger may not be as great as anticipated, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.
The Company may be unsuccessful in retaining our personnel or the personnel of the company we acquire.
The success of any merger or other acquisition that we pursue will depend in part on the Company’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by the Company and employees who join the Company from the acquired company. If the Company is unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the combined company, the Company could face disruptions in its operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, the Company’s business activities may be adversely affected, and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating the Company and the acquired company to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the Company’s business to suffer. In addition, the Company may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave the combined company.
The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs related to the acquisition and integration of Cambridge and other businesses.
The Company routinely incurs significant, non-recurring costs when it agrees to acquire other businesses. In addition, the Company incurs integration costs following the completion of acquisitions as it integrates the acquired business, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. The Company may also incur additional costs to retain key employees of the Company and the acquired business. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the acquired businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. 
Regulatory approvals related to proposed business acquisitions may not be received, may take longer to receive than expected, or may impose burdensome conditions, which could impose additional costs and could delay or prevent completion of the acquisition.
Before a merger or other acquisition may be completed, certain approvals or consents must be obtained from various bank regulatory and other authorities of the United States, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New Hampshire. These governmental entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the New Hampshire Banking Department, may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction or require changes to the terms of the transaction, require divestitures or place restrictions on our conduct after the completion of the transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the transaction or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the Company following the completion of the transaction, any of which might have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 The degree of scrutiny that our regulators give to mergers and other acquisitions can change from time to time. In general, we anticipate that as the Company increases in size and complexity, our proposed mergers and other acquisitions will receive greater regulatory scrutiny and the time that regulators will take to process the applications will increase.
In September 2024, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the FDIC announced that each respective agency has withdrawn the 1995 Bank Merger Competitive Review Guidelines (the “1995 Guidelines”). The Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division announced that it will instead evaluate the bank mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines that 
26
apply across all industries. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Federal Reserve Board has not released any new guidance on its approach to bank merger reviews, nor has it withdrawn from the 1995 Guidelines. Past statements from the Federal Reserve Board staff indicate that the Federal Reserve Board is not actively planning to alter its approach to bank merger reviews. The 2023 Merger Guidelines set forth more stringent concentration limits than the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines. The 2023 Merger Guidelines provide additional, largely qualitative grounds on which the Department of Justice could object to a transaction beyond traditional local market concentration. At this time, we are unable to predict whether the actions taken by the FDIC and the Department of Justice will have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire or merge with banking companies in our market area.
To the extent that we acquire other companies, our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent with such acquisitions. 
 A significant component of our business strategy is to grow through acquisitions of other financial institutions or business lines as opportunities arise. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:
•
Competition with other prospective buyers resulting in our inability to complete an acquisition or in our paying a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business;
•
Inability to obtain regulatory or shareholder approvals, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals; or the imposition of costly or burdensome conditions to regulatory approvals;
•
Potential difficulties and/or unexpected expenses relating to the integration of the operations, technologies, products and the key employees of the acquired business, resulting in the diversion of resources from the operation of our existing business;
•
Acquisitions of new lines of business may present risks that are different in kind or degree compared to those that we are accustomed to managing, requiring us to implement new or enhance existing procedures and controls and diverting resources from the operation of our existing business;
•
Inability to maintain existing customers of the acquired business or to sell the products and services of the acquired business to our existing customers;
•
Inability to retain key management of the acquired business;
•
Assumption of or potential exposure to significant liabilities of the acquired business, some of which may be unknown or contingent at the time of acquisition, including, without limitation, liabilities for regulatory and compliance issues;
•
Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired business;
•
Failure to mitigate deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at the acquired business;
•
Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired business; 
•
Inability to improve the revenues and profitability or realize the cost savings and synergies expected of the acquired business;
•
Potential future impairment of the value of goodwill and intangible assets acquired, as discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; and
•
Identification of internal control deficiencies of the acquired business.
We anticipate that whenever we acquire a business through a merger or another type of transaction, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition will be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, and our subsequent evaluation of that goodwill, at least annually, will be a critical accounting estimate. Under current accounting rules, at the time we complete an acquisition, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired will determine the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired, and subsequently, if we determine that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets. If such a write-down occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. (For more information regarding the risk of goodwill impairment, please see “We may be required to write down goodwill and other acquisition-related identifiable intangible assets.”)
All of these and other potential risks may serve as a diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns, and any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per share may occur in connection with any future transaction.
27
We may be unsuccessful identifying and competing for acquisitions.
We regularly look for acquisition opportunities of banks and financial institutions that meet our criteria, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance and could involve significant cash expenditures or result in a material increase in the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding. We face competition from other financial services institutions, some of which may have greater financial resources than us, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive opportunities may not be available to us, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, completing or integrating future acquisitions. We may not be able to acquire other institutions on acceptable terms. The ability to grow may be limited if we are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.
Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry Generally
Changes in interest rates have impacted and may continue to impact our profitability and financial condition.
Net interest income historically has been, and we anticipate that it will remain, a significant component of our total revenue. A high percentage of our assets and liabilities involve interest-bearing or interest-related instruments. Thus, changes in interest rates have impacted and will likely continue to impact many areas of our business, including net interest income, both the earnings and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as loan delinquency and the fair values of our investment portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including global, national, regional and local economic conditions, the effects of disease pandemics such as COVID-19, competitive pressures, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FOMC. Changes in interest rates have influenced and will continue to influence the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets, our net interest income may decline and, with it, a decline in our earnings may occur. Our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.
The fair values of our investment portfolio can be adversely affected by changes in interest rates or expectations of changes, and inflation rates or expectations of inflation, among other factors. The FOMC may and often does change its view as to whether the federal funds rate target band should increase or decrease and the rate at which such change should occur. The FOMC decreased the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a target range of 4.75% to 5.00% in September 2024 and by 25 basis points in November and December, reducing the federal funds rate target band at year end to 4.25% from 4.50%. However, in December 2024, the FOMC revised its outlook for rate cuts in 2025, indicating that FOMC members anticipated two reductions in 2025 instead of the four reductions that the FOMC members anticipated in September 2024. Jerome H. Powell, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, stated in December 2024 that after the FOMC decreased the federal funds rate target band in 2024 by a total of 100 basis points, the FOMC could be more cautious as it considers further adjustments, emphasizing that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess future economic data. Chairman Powell further explained in December 2024 that if the United States economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward the FOMC’s 2% target, the FOMC could decide to slow the pace at which it chooses to reduce the federal funds rate target band, but alternatively if the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to decline more quickly than anticipated, the FOMC could choose to accelerate the pace at which it chooses to reduce the federal funds rate target band.
Higher interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations and refinancings, while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations and refinancings. Our ability to generate gains on sales of mortgage loans is significantly dependent on the level of originations. Cash flows are affected by changes in market interest rates. Generally, in rising interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates are likely to decline, and in falling interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates are likely to increase. A significant amount of our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate, including multi-family residential real estate loans, are adjustable-rate loans and an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers, especially those with adjustable rate loans, to pay their loan obligations. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds and other factors may also cause the value of our loans held for sale to change. 
Although we have implemented risk management strategies, as well as policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates have from time to time had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
If actual borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions in the future are significantly different than we anticipate, then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
28
If our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to cover loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.
At December 31, 2024, our allowance for loan losses was $229.0 million, or 1.29% of total loans, compared to $149.0 million, or 1.07% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. If our assumptions in determining the amount of allowance for loan losses are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which could materially decrease our net income. 
In addition, our federal and state regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the allowance by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to income, or to charge-off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provision for loan losses or net increase in charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.
We primarily serve individuals, businesses and municipalities located in eastern and central Massachusetts, including the greater Boston metropolitan area, southern New Hampshire, including its coastal region, and northern Rhode Island. At December 31, 2024, approximately $13.0 billion, or 91.4% of our total loans secured by real estate were secured by real estate located in this market area. Therefore, our success is largely dependent on the economic conditions, including employment levels, population growth, income levels, savings trends and government policies, in this market area. Weaker economic conditions caused by recessions, unemployment, inflation, a decline in real estate values or other factors beyond our control may adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to service their debt obligations and could result in higher loan and lease losses and lower net income for us.
A substantial portion of our loan portfolio is composed of loans secured by real estate property located in the greater Boston metropolitan area. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions or other events could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure. 
A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects on our business, including the following: 
•
A decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products and services offered by us;
•
A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate; 
•
An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;
•
A decrease in interest income from variable rate loans due to declines in interest rates; and 
•
An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, net charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. 
Moreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment, public health crises or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, if present, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. If economic conditions worsen or volatility increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. For more information about our market area, please see the 
“Business” 
section included in Part I, Item 1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our ability to manage reputational risk is critical to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees and to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.
As a bank with strong local and community relationships, our reputation is a valuable component of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities in our market area. We strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our 
29
operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or by events beyond our control, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. 
Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, the perception of unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, cybersecurity breaches and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers and employees, costly litigation and increased governmental regulation, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. 
Social media may exacerbate the risk of negative publicity, including by amplifying and accelerating the dissemination of rumors and disinformation. The Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, released a report in October 2024 acknowledging the potential for social media to facilitate or accelerate deposit runs through the propagation of information, including rumors or false information. In its report, the Financial Stability Board noted that the repetition of information in social media, which users experience through the re-posting or liking of other people’s posts, can reinforce a message and may make the message more believable.
We face continuing and growing security risks to our information data bases, including information we maintain relating to our customers. 
We are subject to certain operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, inadequate or failed internal processes, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our business and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding customers. Our electronic communications and information systems infrastructure, as well as the systems infrastructures of the vendors we use, are inherently vulnerable to unauthorized access, human error, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, malicious code, spam attacks, phishing, ransomware or other forms of social engineering and other events that could impact the security, reliability, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems or those of our vendors. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. No matter how well designed or implemented our controls are, we will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and we may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches in a timely manner. A failure or circumvention of our security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.
We regularly assess and test our security systems and disaster preparedness, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. We are not able to fully protect against these events given the rapid evolution of new vulnerabilities, the complex and distributed nature of our systems, our interdependence on the systems of other companies and the increased sophistication of potential attack vectors and methods against our systems. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remain a priority. Accordingly, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. Any breach of our system security could result in disruption of our operations, unauthorized access to confidential customer information, significant regulatory costs, such as enforcement actions and/or the imposition of civil money penalties, litigation exposure and other possible damages, loss or liability. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of available insurance coverage, if any, and would adversely affect our earnings. Also, any failure to prevent a security breach or to quickly and effectively deal with such a breach could cause reputational harm, negatively impact customer confidence, undermine our ability to attract and keep customers, and possibly result in regulatory sanctions.
We rely on third-party vendors, which could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks.
Third-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, including certain data processing and information services. Third parties may transmit confidential, propriety information on our behalf. Although we require third-party providers to maintain certain levels of information security, such providers may remain vulnerable to operational and technology vulnerabilities, including cyber-attacks, security breaches, unauthorized access, breaches, fraud, phishing attacks, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks, which could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data, an interruption in service or other similar events that may impact our business. Although we may contractually limit 
30
liability in connection with attacks against third-party providers, we remain exposed to the risk of loss associated with such vendors. In addition, a number of our vendors are large national entities with dominant market presence in their respective fields. Their services could prove difficult to replace in a timely manner if a failure or other service interruption were to occur. We cannot predict the costs or time that would be required to find an alternative service provider. Failures of certain vendors to provide contracted services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and cause us to incur significant expenses. 
Industry competition may adversely affect our degree of success.
Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued industry consolidation. This consolidation may produce larger, better capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices.
In our market areas, we face competition from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, tax-exempt credit unions, financial technology companies (“fintechs”), internet banks, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage and investment banking firms, mortgage companies and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility or lower costs in competing for business.
Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of additional factors, including attractive yields, reputation and stability, customer convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, pricing and range of products, and ability to effectively implement and market technology-driven products and services, among others. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and to retain our current customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected, perhaps materially. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin and financial performance. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.
Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services, that traditionally were banking products, and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic, internet-based, and mobile phone-based financial solutions. 
Competition with non-banks, including technology companies, to provide financial products and services is intensifying. In particular, the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. The federal and state bank regulatory agencies have demonstrated a willingness to charter non-traditional bank charter applicants, such as fintechs, which increases competition in the industry. In addition, other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers under current and proposed interagency guidelines on third party relationships. Regulatory changes, such as revisions to the FDIC’s rules on brokered deposits intended to reflect recent technological changes and innovations, may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products. In addition to fintechs, the large technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers and are expected to continue to explore new ways to do so. Many of these companies, including our competitors, have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures, in part due to lack of physical locations and regulatory compliance costs. Some of these companies also have greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have. 
In addition to external competition, the financial services industry, including the banking sector, is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition, new, unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services. We believe our success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to use technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. However, we may not be able to, among other things, keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes, effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.
We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plan or achieve our performance targets.
An important goal of our strategic plan is expanding our profitable loan and deposit market share through both organic growth and opportunistic strategic transactions. (For a more complete discussion of our strategic plan, please see the 
“Business”
 section included in Part I, Item 1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.) It is possible that one or more factors, including factors outside of our control, may hinder or prevent us from achieving our growth objectives. Our key assumptions include: 
31
•
that we will be able to attract and retain the requisite number of skilled and qualified personnel required to increase our loan origination volume, especially in our commercial banking portfolios. The marketplace for skilled personnel is competitive, which means hiring, training and retaining skilled personnel is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to increase the number of our loan professionals sufficiently to successfully achieve our loan origination targets; 
•
that we will be able to fund asset growth by growing deposits with our overall cost of funds at a rate consistent with our expectations; 
•
that we will be able to successfully identify and purchase high-quality interest-earning assets that perform over time in accordance with our expectations; and 
•
that there will be no material change in competitive dynamics, including as a result of our seeking to increase market share.
If one or more of our assumptions prove incorrect, we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plan, we may never achieve our indicative performance targets and any shortfall may be material.
Our business strategy includes projected growth in our core businesses, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.
Despite recent challenges within the banking sector, we expect to experience growth in the amount of our assets, the level of our deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our customers’ ability to meet their obligations to us, our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available, or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. 
We could fail to attract, retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel, including our senior management, other key employees or members of our Board, which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business.
A cornerstone of our strategic plan involves retaining as well as hiring highly skilled and qualified personnel. Accordingly, our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel, including our senior management and other key employees and directors. The failure to attract or retain, including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel, or ability to replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel, could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy, which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully, achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions, such as us, can compensate their officers and employees may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with financial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.
The fair value of Eastern Bank’s investments has declined and could decline further due to a variety of factors.
Most of Eastern Bank’s investment securities portfolio is designated as available-for-sale. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale portfolio is recorded as other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Due to increases in interest rates in 2022 and 2023, the fair value of Eastern Bank’s investment portfolio declined, causing a corresponding decline in shareholders’ equity, and additional increases in interest rates could lead to a further corresponding decline in shareholders’ equity. Management believes that several factors will affect the fair values of the investment portfolio, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates or expectations of changes, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation and the slope of the interest rate yield curve. Adverse developments in the factors used to assess credit related impairment could require us to recognize an impairment in the value of our investment securities portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.
32
Commercial loans, including those secured by commercial real estate, are generally riskier than other types of loans and constitute a significant portion of our loan portfolio.
Our commercial loan portfolio, including those secured by commercial real estate, comprised $12.2 billion, or 68.8% of our total loans at December 31, 2024. Commercial loans generally carry larger balances and involve a higher risk of nonpayment or late payment than residential mortgage loans. Most of the commercial and industrial loans are secured by borrower business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and other fixed assets. Compared to real estate, these types of collateral are more difficult to monitor, harder to value, may depreciate more rapidly and may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Repayment of commercial and industrial loans is largely dependent on the business and financial condition of borrowers. Business cash flows are dependent on the demand for the products and services offered by the borrower’s business. Such demand may be reduced when economic conditions are weak or when the products and services offered are viewed as less valuable than those offered by competitors. In addition, some of our commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. These balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the balloon payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. In addition, because of the risks associated with commercial loans, including the economic stress in our market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increasing prevalence of hybrid and remote work, and a higher interest rate environment than existed when loans were first originated, we may experience higher rates of default than if the portfolio were more heavily weighted toward residential mortgage loans. Higher rates of default could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we foreclose on commercial collateral, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for one- to four-family residential real estate loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral, which can result in substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability.
We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with real estate lending activities.
A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. At December 31, 2024, $14.3 billion, or 80.4% of our total loans, comprised loans secured by real estate. If we foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans, we may be exposed to environmental liability risk such as remediation costs, personal injury and property damage, and civil fines and criminal penalties, regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected the property, and we may be limited in our ability to use or sell the affected property or in our remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties. Although management has implemented policies and procedures to mitigate this risk, they may not be sufficient in all instances to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Our business may be adversely affected by credit risks associated with residential property.
At December 31, 2024, loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate were $5.5 billion, or 31.2% of total loans. Loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate include residential real estate mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit and investment real estate loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties. At December 31, 2024, $236.1 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans were part of the commercial loan portfolio. One- to four-family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss. Residential loans with relatively high combined loan-to-value ratios are more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and, therefore, may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. For home equity loans and lines of credit, we may be unsuccessful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on our home equity loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
A portion of our loan portfolio consists of loan participations, which may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we are not the lead lender and we have limited control over credit monitoring.
We routinely purchase loan participations. Although we underwrite these loan participations consistent with our general underwriting criteria, loan participations may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we rely on the lead lender to disclose relevant financial information on a timely basis. Moreover, our decision regarding the classification of a loan participation and loan loss provisions associated with a loan participation is made in part based upon information provided by the lead lender and/or our regulators. A lead lender also may not monitor a participation loan in the same manner as we would for loans that we originate. At December 31, 2024, we held loan participation interests in commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking loans totaling $2.1 billion.
33
Hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings.
We employ techniques that are intended to limit, or “hedge,” the adverse effects of changing interest rates on our loan portfolios. We also engage in hedging strategies with respect to arrangements where our customers swap floating interest rate obligations for fixed interest rate obligations, or vice versa. Our hedging activity varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates and other changing market conditions. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, interest rate swaps, collars and floors. There are, however, no perfect hedging strategies, and interest rate hedging may fail to protect us from loss. Moreover, hedging activities could result in losses if the event against which we hedge does not occur. Additionally, interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because, among other things: 
•
available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought; 
•
the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability; 
•
the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay;
•
the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; 
•
the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value; and/or 
•
downward adjustments, or “mark-to-market” losses, would reduce our shareholders’ equity. 
New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.
From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved; price and profitability targets may not prove feasible; and customers may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology of introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We may be required to write down goodwill and other acquisition-related identifiable intangible assets.
When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. As of December 31, 2024, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $1.1 billion. Under current accounting guidance, if we determine that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets. We conduct an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired. We conduct a quarterly review for indicators of impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Our management recently completed these reviews and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2024. We cannot provide assurance whether we will be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.
We are subject to stringent capital requirements and may need to raise additional capital in the future, and that capital may not be available or its cost may be high. 
We are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which we must maintain. If we fail to meet these capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, then our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. From time to time, our regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. We may need to raise additional capital to meet these heightened capital requirements or to otherwise support growth. Any changes to regulatory capital requirements could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital. 
Our ability to raise additional capital will depend, for example, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and our recent operating results at that time and expectations regarding our future operating results. If we are unable to raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us or at all, our operations or our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected, and we may be subject to adverse 
34
regulatory action. Additionally, if we raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other securities, it could adversely impact the ownership interests or create rights senior to those of existing shareholders or dilute the per share value of our common stock.
We face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us.
From time to time, we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Actions against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we could experience a high level of litigation related to our businesses and operations. There could be substantial cost and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations. 
Our businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject us to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure our operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing our revenue. Please see the sections titled “Business—Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1, and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate or expensive.
We maintain an insurance coverage program that provides limited coverage for some, but not all, potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. We may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, certain risks generally are not fully insurable. Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or under-insured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.
The loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase our cost of funding and our funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth.
Our funding costs increased materially beginning in 2022 and may continue to increase if our deposits decline and we are forced to replace them with more expensive sources of funding, if clients shift their deposits into higher cost products, or if we raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Increases to the federal funds rate in 2022 and 2023, and competitor and customer responses to those increases, have caused and potentially may cause competitive pressures to provide elevated deposit interest rates. The reduction in our overall level of deposits has increased and could continue to increase the extent to which we rely on other, more expensive sources for funding. 
As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These additional sources consist primarily of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank that we sometimes refer to as “advances,” proceeds from the sale of loans or investments, reciprocal deposits and brokered deposits. As we continue to grow, or as competitive pressures increase with regard to core funding sources, we could become more dependent on these additional sources. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability in accessing these additional funding sources, constraining our financial flexibility. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Various factors beyond our control, including interest rate increases and competition from banks and other financial institutions, adversely affect our liquidity.
Liquidity describes our ability to meet financial needs that arise in the normal course of our business, including deposit withdrawals and anticipated loan fundings, as well as current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from calls, maturities and sales of securities. The significant increases in market interest rates beginning in 2022 initially contributed and may continue to contribute to a decline in our core deposits as customers seek higher interest rates from sources such as non-bank money market funds and bank competitors. We have undertaken and may continue to undertake measures to mitigate market-wide competitive deposit pressures or interest rate uncertainty or to otherwise manage our liquidity position. These have included and may 
35
continue to include accessing alternative funding sources, such as FHLBB advances and brokered certificates of deposit, as noted above.
Our investment portfolio also provides a potential source of liquidity that we have from time to time elected to and may continue to access. Due to the increase in interest rates, the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio has declined in value since our initial purchase, resulting in a net unrealized loss position. We have in the past elected to sell a significant amount of investment securities with substantial unrealized losses, and we may choose to do so from time to time in the future. In that event, we would recognize a loss and take a charge to our operating results in the quarter in which a decision to sell such securities is made. 
Deterioration in the performance or financial position of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston might restrict the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston’s ability to meet the funding needs of its members, cause a suspension of its dividend and cause its stock to be determined to be impaired.
Significant components of Eastern Bank’s liquidity needs are met through its access to funding pursuant to its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. Any deterioration in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston’s performance or financial condition may affect our ability to access funding and/or require us to deem the required investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock to be impaired. If we are not able to access funding through the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, we may not be able to meet our liquidity needs, or we may need to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources, either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Similarly, if we deem all or part of our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock impaired, such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
We may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, or such implementations could be delayed materially, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability. 
We invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, or such implementations could be delayed materially, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which in turn could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and suspension of trading in our stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations. 
Failure to optimize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.
We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. 
Third-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we believe we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. We cannot assure that our third-party service providers will be able to continue to provide their services in an efficient, cost-effective manner, if at all, or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. Any problems caused by these third-parties, including an interruption in service, or as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, could cause a disruption to our business and could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant and unpredictable delay and expense. 
Operational risks are inherent in our businesses.
Our enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance and reputational. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
36
In addition to the necessity of maintaining our enterprise risk management framework, our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations. Operational risk and losses can result from factors such as internal and external fraud; errors by employees or third parties; failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical, telecommunications or other essential utility outages; business continuity and data security system failures, including those caused by computer viruses, cyber-attacks or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems; or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls, including those of our suppliers or counterparties. Although we have implemented and routinely refine our risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and we devote substantial resources to developing efficient procedures, identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and staff training, it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks we face. Any weakness in these systems or controls, or any violation or alleged violation of applicable laws or regulations, could result in increased regulatory supervision, enforcement actions and other disciplinary action, and have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, reputation and ability to obtain future regulatory approvals, including those necessary to complete mergers or other acquisitions. 
Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and our financial condition or operating results.
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and those that will be included in periodic reports that we will file in the future under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our valuation of goodwill and core deposit intangible in connection with our periodic impairment assessment of such balances, valuation of our retirement plans and pension benefits, our determination of our income tax provision, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, and our evaluation of the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. Please see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” within Item 7 for more information and 
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our internal controls, procedures and policies may fail or be circumvented, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. A failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with related regulations could result in regulatory investigations or penalties, reduce investor confidence, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
In particular, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes numerous requirements, including an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, a report on these controls, and a formal attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm. If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.
We maintain a significant investment in projects that generate tax credits, which we may not be able to fully utilize, or, if utilized, may be subject to recapture or restructuring.
As part of Eastern Bank’s community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in qualified affordable housing projects and other tax credit investment projects. Eastern Bank receives low-income housing tax credits, investment tax credits, rehabilitation tax credits and other tax credits as a result of its investments in these limited partnership investments. At December 31, 2024, we maintained investments of approximately $222.7 million in entities for which we receive allocations of tax credits, excluding investments of approximately $3.9 million in qualified zone academy bond investments, which we utilize to offset our income tax liability. We recorded the benefit of $17.0 million in credits for the year ended December 31, 2024. We intend to utilize all tax credits, as of December 31, 2024, to offset income tax liability. Substantially all of these tax credits are related to development projects that are subject to ongoing compliance requirements over certain periods of time to fully realize their value. If these projects are not operated in full compliance with the required terms, the tax credits could be subject to 
37
recapture or restructuring. Further, we may not be able to utilize any future tax credits. If we are unable to utilize our tax credits or, if our tax credits are subject to recapture or restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties. 
In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. If any of such information is incorrect, then the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties may be misrepresented, which would increase our credit risk and expose us to possible write-downs and losses. 
We may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. 
We rely on a combination of owned and licensed trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and other intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain services or other competitive harm. In addition, certain aspects of our business and our services rely on technologies licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all. The loss or diminution of our intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain third-party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete. 
We may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services infringe upon or otherwise violate a third party’s proprietary rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be granted, intellectual property rights, including trademarks, that could be infringed by our services or other aspects of our business. Third parties have made, and may make, claims of infringement against us with respect to our services or business. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. Even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our services. Any intellectual property related dispute or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and by economic conditions generally. 
Weakness in the U.S. economy may adversely affect our business. A deterioration of business and economic conditions has adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect the credit quality of our loans, results of operations and financial condition. Increases in loan delinquencies and default rates could adversely impact our loan charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses. Deterioration or defaults made by issuers of the underlying collateral of our investment securities may cause additional credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charges to our income statement. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. 
In addition to these specific effects, widespread adverse economic conditions that could affect us include: 
•
Reduced consumer spending;
•
Increased unemployment;
•
Lower wage income levels;
•
Declines in the market value of residential and commercial real estate, including real estate that collateralizes our loans;
•
Inflation or deflation; 
•
Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; 
•
Volatility in short-term and long-term interest rates (For more information regarding the potential effect of fluctuating interest rates, see “Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability.”); and 
•
Higher bankruptcy filings. 
38
Changes in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.
Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board changes the financial accounting and reporting principles that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Additionally, significant changes to accounting standards may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expense that will negatively impact our operating results. 
The financial weakness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. 
Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial financial weakness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interconnected as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. We may be exposed to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 
Market changes may adversely affect demand for our services and impact results of operations. 
Channels for servicing our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and increased demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. We compete with larger providers who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process. We have a process for evaluating the profitability of our branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.
Changes in the equity markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for fee-based services. 
Economic downturns could affect the volume of revenue from and demand for fee-based services. Revenue from Eastern Bank’s wealth management division depends in large part on the level of assets under management and administration. Market volatility and the potential of such volatility to lead customers to liquidate investments, as well as lower asset values, could reduce the level of assets under management and administration and thereby decrease our investment management revenue.
Climate change, natural disasters, public health crises, geopolitical developments, acts of terrorism and other external events could harm our business. 
Natural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our local market area and ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including a possible resurgence of the COVID-19 virus or the possible emergence of the H5 avian influenza), domestic or geopolitical crises, such as terrorism, military conflict, wars or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, political instability or civil unrest, or other conflict, human error or other events outside of our control, could cause disruptions to our business or the United States economy as a whole, and our business and operating results could suffer. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 
Climate change may worsen the severity and impact of future hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and other extreme weather-related events that could cause disruption to our business and operations. Chronic results of climate change such as shifting weather patterns could also cause disruption to our business and operations.
Rising sea levels projected for the coastal regions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire could adversely affect our business. 
We believe that progressively rising sea levels will be an area of risk over time for the coastal regions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in our market, both as the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increase and as 
39
currently inhabited property and land parcels are exposed to episodic flooding and routinely higher tides. The increase in the relative sea level in Boston, as a coastal city, and other coastal regions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in our market is expected to result in higher coastal surges during storm events and, when considered with projected increases in precipitation intensities, an increase in stormwater flooding. These effects in Boston and similar conditions elsewhere in our market area may adversely affect the value of commercial and residential properties that secure some of our loans and may adversely affect economic develop in portions of our market area. 
Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. 
Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts, and consumers and businesses also may change their behavior as a result of these concerns. Eastern Bank and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns, which could involve cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, and the like. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. 
We are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the trading price of our common stock. 
We are subject to a variety of environmental, social and governance risks (“ESG matters”). Risks arising from ESG matters may adversely affect, among other things, our reputation and the trading price of our common stock. 
As a financial institution with a diverse base of customers, vendors and suppliers, we may face potential negative publicity based on the identity of those we choose to do business with. If our relationships with our customers, vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be negatively impacted and our stock price may also be impacted. 
Additionally, many investors now consider how corporations are addressing ESG matters when making investment decisions, such as the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies’ responses to climate change and other ESG matters. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock if investors believe that we do not sufficiently address ESG matters in accordance with their or third-party standards for evaluating ESG matters.
Further, our regulators, including the SEC, may adopt regulations related to ESG matters that could require the collection, assessment, and reporting of extensive data, including emissions-related data, in categories and formats that are novel to us. Although we have begun considering and developing various measures to address potential future regulatory requirements, these measures may not be sufficient in every instance to ensure full compliance with such requirements. 
The prevalence of remote and hybrid working arrangements has reduced demand for office space in our market.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused many employers to shift to remote and/or hybrid workforce arrangements in which employees work from their homes instead of going into their employers’ offices. Remote and/or hybrid work patterns may have long-term implications for how many businesses successfully operate and, in turn, their need for leased office space. A reduction in the need for office space could result in a reduction in our loan demand and/or in our customers’ ability to repay their loans, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, any material reduction in the demand for these categories of commercial office space in our market could adversely affect both the value of the collateral securing a portion of our commercial real estate loans and the demand by developers and other borrowers for new commercial real estate loans, which, in turn, may have a negative impact on our business and financial results.
Risks Related to Regulations
Monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the monetary and related policies of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board, acting through its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), regulates the money supply and credit conditions by using instruments such as open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks’ reserve requirements against bank deposits and the interest rate paid on such reserves. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 
40
The monetary and related policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond Eastern Bank’s control and the effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted. 
Our business is highly regulated, which could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.
Eastern Bank and Eastern Bankshares, Inc. are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by regulatory authorities, including the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible non-banking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on stock repurchases and dividend payments. The FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks have the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve Board possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we and Eastern Bank may conduct business and obtain financing. Regulatory requirements, as well as our own internal stress testing and capital management policies, may, among other things, require us to increase our capital levels, limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders, modify our business strategies, or decrease our exposure to various asset classes. Certain capital transactions, including share repurchases and the declaration and issuance of dividends, are subject to the approval of our regulators. These requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments. 
Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other impacts. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See the section titled “Business—Supervision and Regulation” included in Part I, Item 1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the regulations to which we are subject. 
Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, monetary laws, rules, standards, policies and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. 
In addition, changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance. Our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals, final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business. Also, our regulators expect us to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with third-party technology providers. 
We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.
The Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these federal laws and regulations and comparable state provisions. Various federal banking agencies have recently completed significant changes to their respective Community Reinvestment Act regulations. Federal, state, or local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
41
We may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.
The financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of federal and state regulations, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with anti-money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals. Enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. Failure to comply with these and other regulations, and supervisory expectations related thereto, may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage or restrictions on our business including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. 
Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.
The USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. Although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. 
An increase in FDIC insurance assessments could significantly increase our expenses. 
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits of federally insured banks and savings institutions. The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”), up to prescribed limits. To fund the DIF, the FDIC imposes assessments on the insured banks and savings institutions. The FDIC has established a long-term deposit insurance reserve ratio of 2.0% and thus seeks to fund the DIF at 2% of estimated deposits. In September 2020, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan designed to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 2028. In October 2022, the FDIC increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules for all FDIC insured depository institutions by 2 basis points, beginning with the quarterly assessment period ending March 31, 2023. The new base assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the DIF reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2%, absent further FDIC action. The FDIC also imposed a special assessment arising out of the banking crisis in early 2023, for which we expensed approximately $10.8 million in total in the fourth quarter of 2023. In February 2024, the FDIC updated the estimated loss related to the banking crisis to $20.4 billion, an increase from its original estimate of $16.3 billion. Accordingly, based on the FDIC’s modified loss estimate, we experienced an increase in special assessment expense in June 2024 of $1.9 million. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change, and additional increases or modifications to assessments, due to, for example, changes in base or special assessments or downgraded ratings of Eastern Bank, could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may be unable to disclose some restrictions or limitations on our operations imposed by our regulators. 
Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial institution’s activities. In some instances, we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions. In addition, as part of our regular examination process, our and our banking subsidiary’s respective regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Any such actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could adversely affect our costs and revenues. Moreover, efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems, as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention. As a result, such supervisory actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations; and, in certain instances, we may not be able to publicly disclose these matters. 
We could be required to act as a “source of strength” to our banking subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Federal law and policy require bank holding companies such as Eastern Bankshares, Inc. to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when Eastern Bankshares, Inc. might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so might not otherwise be in the interests of the shareholders or creditors of Eastern Bankshares, Inc., and may include one or more of the following: 
42
•
Any extension of credit from Eastern Bankshares, Inc. to Eastern Bank or any other bank subsidiary that is included in the relevant bank’s capital would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks.
•
In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment that the bank holding company had been required to make to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
•
In certain circumstances if we have two or more bank subsidiaries, one bank subsidiary could be assessed for losses incurred by another bank subsidiary. In addition, in the event of impairment of the capital stock of one of our banking subsidiaries, Eastern Bankshares, Inc., as our banking subsidiary’s shareholder, could be required to pay such deficiency. 
Laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
We currently are subject to state and federal rules regarding privacy and data protection, such as the Massachusetts data security law (Standards for the Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth). Our growth and expansion into a variety of new fields may potentially involve new U.S.-based regulatory issues/requirements including, for example, the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation or the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). In addition, other authorities may take the position that we are subject to additional data protection laws or regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation if, for example, some of our customers are or become residents of applicable countries or states while maintaining account relationships with us. The potential costs of compliance with or imposed by new or existing laws and regulations and policies may affect the use of our products and services and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
Changes in tax laws and regulations and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely affect our financial statements and our operating results. 
From time to time, local, state or federal tax authorities change tax laws and regulations, which may result in a decrease or increase to our deferred tax asset. Local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken on tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, penalties or litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 
Due to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, we may not be able to deduct all of the compensation of some executives, including executives of companies we may acquire in the future. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits to $1 million annual deductions for compensation paid to “covered employees” of any publicly held corporation, such as Eastern Bankshares, Inc. The definition of “covered employees” generally includes anyone who served as the principal executive officer (“PEO”) or principal financial officer (“PFO”) at any time during the taxable year; the three highest compensated executive officers (other than the PEO or PFO), determined under SEC rules; and any individual who was a covered employee, including of a “predecessor company,” at any point during a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2017, even after the employee terminates employment. We expect that in most if not all cases a publicly traded company that we might acquire in the future will be a “predecessor company.” Accordingly, we expect that the number of our covered employees will increase if Eastern acquires one or more publicly held corporations. Beginning in 2027, the definition of “covered employees” under Section 162(m) will include, in addition to the CEO, CFO and the three highest-paid executive officers already covered by Section 162(m), our five next most highly compensated employees. We expect that we will not be able to deduct all of the compensation paid to covered employees so long as Eastern qualifies as a “publicly held corporation,” thus increasing our income taxes and reducing our net income.
Regulatory developments could adversely affect our business by increasing our costs and thereby making our business less profitable.
Our profitability may be adversely affected by current and future rulemaking and enforcement activity by the various federal, state and self-regulatory organizations to which we are subject. Regulations can adversely affect our compliance costs and other non-interest expenses, and failure to comply with regulations could subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
New laws, rules and regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, rules or regulations, from time to time could increase our expenses, causing our recent historical expenses not to be indicative of future expenses, and could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct or plan to conduct, modifications to our current or future business practices, and increased capital requirements.
43
It is unclear how and whether our regulators, including the SEC, FDIC, other banking regulators and other state insurance regulators may respond to, or enforce elements of, these new regulations or develop their own similar laws and regulations. The impacts, degree and timing of the effect of applicable laws, future regulations and industry principles on our business cannot now be anticipated and may have further impacts on our products and services and the results of operations.
Our business may be adversely affected by the public policy priorities of the Trump administration.
Changes in the public policy priorities of elected officials and appointed regulators can affect our business directly, including through changes in the regulatory environment in which we and our competitors operate, and the markets that we serve, which could have an indirect impact on our business. 
Changes associated with the Trump administration’s emphasis on stablecoins and digital assets could have an adverse impact on our business.
President Trump’s Executive Order entitled “American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” could result in larger scale adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets, which could potentially impact the number of customers who choose to engage with the traditional banking system and as a result could have a direct or indirect impact on our performance. The Executive Order includes directives to promote dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide, promote the use of blockchain networks to transact and maintain self-custody of digital assets, and to promote and protect access to banking services for related companies and other law-abiding entities. If implemented, these directives could result in broader adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets into the bank regulatory perimeter and the U.S. payment system, which could threaten deposits held at traditional banks, including Eastern Bank.  
Risks Related to Stock-Based Benefit Plans
Our stock-based benefit plans have increased and will continue to increase our expenses and reduce our income.
In 2021, we adopted the Equity Plan, which impacts our annual compensation and benefit expenses related to awards granted to participants under such plan. The actual amount of the stock-related compensation and benefit expenses will depend on the number of awards actually granted under the Equity Plan, the fair market value of the awards on the date of grant, the vesting period, and other factors which we cannot predict at this time.
In addition, we recognize compensation expense monthly for our employee stock ownership plan (which we sometimes refer to as our ESOP) when shares are committed to be released to participants’ accounts, and we recognize compensation expense for restricted stock awards, performance stock units and restricted stock units over the vesting period of awards made to recipients.
Risks Related to Our Articles of Organization and State and Federal Banking Laws
Various factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve.
Certain provisions of our articles of organization and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of Eastern Bankshares, Inc. without our Board of Directors’ approval. For example, if a person were to acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of our common stock, the holder of shares in excess of the 10% threshold will be entitled to cast only one one-hundredth (1/100) of a vote per share for each share in excess of the 10% threshold. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring control of a bank holding company. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company, including shares of our common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer “controls” the bank holding company. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any bank, including Eastern Bank, and certain non-bank companies. 
Provisions in our articles of organization may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt, including, among others, a provision that prohibits any person from casting a full vote for any shares of common stock exceeding the 10% threshold, as described above; the prohibition on removal of directors without cause; and the required approval of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares then-outstanding entitled to vote for business combination transactions with interested shareholders. Additionally, our Board of Directors is currently classified, with directors serving three-year staggered terms. However, the classified structure is being phased out, and by our 2027 annual meeting of stockholders, directors will be elected for annual terms. Furthermore, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock options that we may grant to employees and directors, stock ownership by our management and directors, employment agreements and/or change in control agreements that we have entered into with our executive officers and other factors may make it more expensive for companies or persons to acquire control of Eastern Bankshares, Inc. Taken as a whole, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of 
44
organization could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
The articles of organization of Eastern Bankshares, Inc. provide that state and federal courts located in Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 
The articles of organization of Eastern Bankshares, Inc. provide that state and federal courts located in Massachusetts will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. The articles of organization further provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Business Litigation Session of the Suffolk County Superior Court (the “BLS”) (1) is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Eastern Bankshares, Inc., any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Massachusetts corporate law, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and (2) is a concurrent jurisdiction for any claim arising under the Securities Act of 1933 or the rules and regulations thereunder. The articles of organization also provide that the exclusive forum provision does not apply to any claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, including all suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes and could discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find our choice of forum provision inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
The market price of our stock value may be negatively affected by applicable regulations that restrict stock repurchases by us.
Our repurchase of shares of common stock is subject to Federal Reserve Board policy related to repurchases of shares by depository institution holding companies. To date, we have received three notices of non-objection to proposed share repurchase programs, as previously discussed. Each notice of non-objection has covered an approximately 12-month period. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain notices of non-objection from the Federal Reserve Board in the future.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
We embrace a “defense in depth” approach to assess, identify, and manage cybersecurity threats. A defense in depth approach seeks to implement multiple layers of defenses in order to help reduce the risk that a single process or control failure might result in a material incident. 
We utilize a risk management framework to assess, manage, and report on material risks and threats. In light of the importance of cybersecurity matters, we have developed as part of this framework a risk domain specific to cybersecurity matters, including specifying applicable risk tolerances and metrics.

The 
Executive Vice President, Chief Information Officer (CIO)
, who has served in information technology leadership roles with the Company since 2007 and has over 20 years of experience with matters related to cybersecurity, including as an executive leader and consultant, and Executive Vice President, Enterprise Risk Management (EVP, ERM), who has served in risk management leadership roles for the Company since 2015, have oversight over information technology and enterprise risk management matters, respectively, and receive monthly reports on cyber-related metrics and activities from their teams.
 In addition, we have implemented escalation procedures and protocols, including an incident response team that includes key members of management such as the CIO and EVP, ERM, to manage and coordinate responses to potentially significant cybersecurity incidents.

Third party vendors are utilized to help validate our security posture and controls, and we have developed a third party vendor management program to assess and monitor risks arising from third party vendor systems.

The Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors has responsibility for oversight of the design, implementation, and operation of our enterprise risk management framework, including review and approval of risk management policies and review of our monitoring of risk, the effectiveness of its risk management processes, and material changes in risk. As part of this enterprise risk management oversight, our management team, including the EVP ERM and his team, provides quarterly reporting on our cybersecurity risk domain to the Risk Management Committee.

The Risk Management Committee in turn reports on significant enterprise risk management issues to the full 
Board
.

In 2024, no cybersecurity events were identified that materially impacted our business strategy, operations, or financial condition.
 As further detailed in the “Risk Factors” section In Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe cybersecurity 
45
matters could pose a material risk to our strategy, operations, or financial condition. For example, a significant breach of our system security, or that of our third-party service providers, could enable access to Company or customer sensitive or confidential information or assets or could disrupt our business operations. This could result in costs of investigation, remediation and/or payment of a ransom; reputational harm and impairment of customer relationships; loss of revenue and regulatory sanctions and penalties, lawsuits, and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
