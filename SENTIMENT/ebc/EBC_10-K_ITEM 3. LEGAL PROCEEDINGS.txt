Dividends
We intend to continue to pay regular cash dividends to holders of our common stock; however, any future determination to declare and pay cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a variety of factors, including applicable laws, our financial condition, results of operations, business prospects, general business or financial market conditions, regulatory environment and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. To the extent dividends from Eastern Bank will be a source of cash used by the Company to pay its dividends, dividends from the Bank will be dependent on the Bank’s future earnings, capital requirements, and financial condition.
Repurchases of Common Shares
On July 25, 2024, we announced the approval by our Board of Directors of a new share repurchase program. The program authorized the purchase of up to 10,800,000 shares over a 12-month period and is limited to $200.0 million through July 31, 2025 and may be modified or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time. Repurchases are made at management’s discretion from time to time at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders, subject to the availability of shares, general market conditions, the trading price of the shares, alternative uses for capital and liquidity, and our financial performance. Repurchases may be suspended, terminated or modified by us at any time for any reason.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and prospects based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those in this discussion as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a bank holding company, and our principal subsidiary, Eastern Bank, is a Massachusetts-chartered bank that has served the banking needs of our customers since 1818. Our business philosophy is to operate as a diversified financial services enterprise providing a broad array of banking and other financial services primarily to retail, commercial and small business customers. We had total assets of $25.6 billion and $21.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the New Hampshire Banking Department, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Our business consists of a full range of banking, lending (commercial, residential and consumer), savings and small business offerings, including our wealth management and trust operations that we conduct through our Cambridge Trust Wealth Management division. Previously, our wealth management and trust operations were conducted through Eastern Wealth Management. Following our merger with Cambridge Bancorp, described further below, the wealth management divisions of both banks now operate under the “Cambridge Trust Wealth Management, a division of Eastern Bank,” brand name.
On July 12, 2024, we completed our previously announced merger with Cambridge and Cambridge Trust. In accordance with the terms of the definitive merger agreement, through which we agreed to acquire Cambridge through a merger with the Company as the surviving entity, each share of Cambridge common stock was exchanged for 4.956 shares of our common stock. The transaction qualified as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes and provided Cambridge shareholders with a tax-free exchange of their shares of Cambridge common stock in exchange for our common stock as the consideration they received in the merger. We issued 38.9 million shares of our common stock in the exchange which resulted in a transaction value of approximately $580.6 million based upon the closing price of our common stock on July 12, 2024 of $14.87 per share.
Cambridge, a Massachusetts corporation, was a federally registered bank holding company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cambridge Trust, a Massachusetts-chartered trust company formed in 1890, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cambridge that operated through a network of 18 full-service banking offices in eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire with $5.3 billion in total assets and $3.9 billion in deposits as of July 12, 2024. Cambridge’s core services also included wealth management. Through its wealth management group, which had offices in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, it offered comprehensive investment management, as well as trust administration, estate settlement, and financial planning services. Cambridge had assets under management and administration of approximately $5.0 billion as of July 12, 2024. Cambridge Trust’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cambridge Trust Company of New Hampshire Inc. (“CTCNH”), offered trust services pursuant to New Hampshire law and was regulated by the New Hampshire Banking Department. CTCNH is now a subsidiary of Eastern Bank. 
In recent years, we managed our business under two business segments: our banking business and our insurance agency business. On October 31, 2023, we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of our insurance agency business. In the third quarter of 2023, following management’s decision to sell our insurance agency business, we reclassified the related assets and liabilities to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, the results of discontinued operations were reclassified to “net income from discontinued operations” on our Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional discussion of discontinued operations, refer to 
Note 23, “Discontinued Operations”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion excludes amounts reported as discontinued operations.
Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, computed in accordance with GAAP, was $119.6 million, as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent increase to net income during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the sale of available for sale securities at a loss in connection with our balance sheet repositioning completed in March 2023. Partially offsetting the increase to net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 were one-time expenses associated with our merger with Cambridge including the allowance for loan losses associated with non-purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans, which was recorded subsequent to the completion of the 
49
merger and is hereafter referred to as the “non-PCD loan day-2” provision for the allowance for loan losses, and merger and acquisition expenses recorded.
Net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 and net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 included items that our management considers non-core, which management excludes for purposes of assessing our operating net income, a non-GAAP financial measure. Operating net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $192.6 million compared to $163.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increased net interest income and noninterest income on an operating basis for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to year ended December 31, 2023 partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense on an operating basis over the same period. See 
“Non-GAAP Financial Measures” 
and 
“Results of Operations”
 below for a reconciliation of operating net income to net income on a GAAP basis and further discussion of noninterest income and noninterest expense.
The following chart shows our basic earnings per share from continuing operations on a GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) basis over the past four years (refer to the 
“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
 section below for a reconciliation of GAAP earnings to operating earnings):
Earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, on a GAAP basis, increased from $(0.39) for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $0.66 for the year ended December 31, 2024. The loss per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a result of a loss on sale of AFS securities in March 2023, which was part of our balance sheet repositioning, as described above. 
Operating earnings per share increased from $1.01 for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $1.06 for the year ended December 31, 2024, a 5.8% increase. The increase was primarily due to an increase net interest income and noninterest income on an operating basis which were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense on an operating basis. Refer to the
“Results of Operations”
 section below for additional discussion of the changes in net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense. 
50
The following chart shows our efficiency ratio on a GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) basis over the past five years (refer to the 
“Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
 section below for additional information on the determination of each measure):
Both the GAAP efficiency ratio and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio decreased during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in the GAAP efficiency ratio is primarily due to lower security losses during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in the non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio was primarily due to increased net interest income and increased noninterest income on an operating basis which increased at a greater rate than noninterest expenses on an operating basis. Refer to the 
“Results of Operations”
 section below for additional discussion of the changes in net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense. 
Outlook and Trends
Interest Rates
Beginning in March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) voted to increase the federal funds rate multiple times from a range of 0.00% to 0.25% to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% on July 26, 2023, when the FOMC stated that it will continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. At its meeting on September 18, 2024, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points from the range set at its July 26, 2023 meeting to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%. At its meeting on November 7, 2024, the FOMC then decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%. At its most recent meeting on January 29, 2025, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at the range established following its November 7, 2024 meeting and indicated, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, it will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The FOMC further indicated it is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and reducing the annual inflation rate to its 2 percent objective.
Inevitably, not all of our interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities will re-price simultaneously and in equal volume in response to changes in the federal funds rate, and therefore the potential for interest rate exposure exists. Management believes that several factors will affect the actual impact of interest rate changes on our balance sheet and operating results, including, but not limited to, actual changes in interest rates or expectations of future changes, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation, and the slope of the interest rate yield curve. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by identifying, quantifying, and, where appropriate, hedging our exposure. Approximately 31% of the outstanding principal balance of our loans, gross of outstanding interest rate swaps as described further below, as of December 31, 2024 was indexed to a market rate that is expected to reprice with similar magnitude and direction as the federal 
51
funds rate. A portion of these loans have been hedged using interest rate swaps to convert the floating rate interest receipts to a fixed rate. The notional amount of floating rate loans swapped totaled $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, representing approximately 13% of the outstanding principal balance of our loans at that date. For more detail regarding such hedging financial instruments, refer to 
Note 18, “Derivative Financial Instruments” 
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to the section titled 
“Management of Market Risk”
 within this Item 7 for additional discussion including the estimated change to our net interest income under interest rate risk measurement methodologies that use a variety of hypothetical scenarios assuming immediate and parallel changes in interest rates that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We present certain non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses to evaluate our performance, and which exclude the effects of certain transactions, non-cash items and GAAP adjustments that we believe are unrelated to our core business and are therefore not necessarily indicative of our current performance or financial position. Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility for investors into our core business as well as underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items in the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Except as otherwise indicated, the information presented for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020 within this section excludes discontinued operations. Refer to 
Note 23, “Discontinued Operations”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding discontinued operations.
There are items in our financial statements that impact our results but which we believe are unrelated to our core business. Accordingly, we present operating net income, noninterest income on an operating basis, noninterest expense on an operating basis, total operating revenue, operating earnings per share, tangible net income to average tangible shareholders’ equity, tangible operating net income to average tangible shareholders’ equity, tangible book value per share, and the operating efficiency ratio, each of which excludes the impact of such items because we believe such exclusion can provide greater visibility into our core business and underlying trends. Such items that we do not consider to be core to our business include (i) income and expenses from investments held in rabbi trusts, (ii) gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, net, (iii) gains and losses on the sale of other equity investments, (iv) gains and losses on the sale of other assets, (v) rabbi trust employee benefits expense, (vi) impairment charges on tax credit investments and associated tax credit benefits, (vii) expenses indirectly associated with our IPO, (viii) other real estate owned (“OREO”) gains, (ix) merger and acquisition expenses, including the “day-2” provision for allowance for loan losses for non-PCD acquired loans, (x) the stock donation to the Eastern Bank Foundation (the “Foundation”) in connection with our mutual-to-stock conversion and IPO, (xi) settlement of putative consumer class action litigation matters related to overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees, and associated settlement expenses, (xii) the non-cash pension settlement charge recognized related to our Defined Benefit Plan, and (xiii) certain discrete tax items.
We also present tangible shareholders’ equity, tangible assets, the ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets, average tangible shareholders’ equity, the ratios of tangible net income (loss) from continuing operations and tangible operating net income to average tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per share, each of which excludes the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, as we believe these financial measures provide investors with the ability to further assess our performance, identify trends in our core business and provide a comparison of our capital adequacy to other companies. We have included the tangible ratios because management believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management to assess performance and identify trends. 
In the third quarter of 2024, we changed our return on average tangible shareholders’ equity and operating return on average tangible shareholders’ equity computations to utilize tangible net income (loss) from continuing operations and tangible operating net income, respectively, in the numerators of the computations. Tangible net income (loss) from continuing operations excludes the amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effect and tangible operating net income excludes, in addition to the adjustments to derive operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets and related tax effect. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, we changed the computation of our operating efficiency ratio to exclude, in addition to the adjustments made to operating net income, the amortization of intangible assets. Management believes the changes to such ratios result in a more meaningful measure of our financial performance and such measures are used by management when analyzing corporate performance. 
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to GAAP net income (loss), or as an indication of our cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. An item which we consider to be non-core and exclude when computing these non-GAAP financial measures can be of substantial importance to our results for any particular period. In addition, our methodology for calculating non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar performance measures and, accordingly, our reported non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the same or similar performance measures reported by other companies.

Total cash and cash equivalents increased by $313.8 million, or 45.3%, to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 from $693.1 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of AFS securities of $1.1 billion and proceeds from maturities and principal paydowns of AFS and HTM securities of $0.4 billion. Partially offsetting these increases were net repayments of FHLB advances of $739.9 million, which includes repayment of advances assumed in connection with our merger with Cambridge, a net decrease in deposits, excluding deposits acquired from Cambridge, of $178.3 million, and a net increase in gross loans, excluding loans acquired from Cambridge, of $171.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. For further discussion of the change in securities, loans, and deposits, refer to the later 
“Securities,” “Loans,”
 and
 “Deposits” 
sections in this Item 7. For further information regarding our merger with Cambridge, refer to 
Note 3, “Mergers and Acquisitions”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Securities
Our current investment policy authorizes us to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate notes, asset-backed securities and state and municipal securities. The Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for approving and overseeing our investment policy, which it reviews at least annually. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns and market risk considerations. We do not engage in any investment hedging activities or trading activities, nor do we purchase any high-risk investment products. We typically invest in the following types of securities:
U.S. government securities:
 Our U.S. government securities consists of U.S. Agency bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. We maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, at zero risk weighting for capital purposes, and as collateral for interest rate derivative positions. U.S. Agency bonds include securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHLB, and the Federal Farm Credit Bureau.
Mortgage-backed securities:
 We invest in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae, including collateralized mortgage obligations. We have not purchased any privately-issued mortgage-backed securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve a positive interest rate spread with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae.
Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or 
57
accretion adjustments. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.
State and municipal securities:
 We invest in fixed rate investment grade bonds issued primarily by municipalities in our local communities within Massachusetts and by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The market value of these securities may be affected by call options, long dated maturities, general market liquidity and credit factors.
The following table shows the fair value of our securities by investment category as of the dates indicated:

Our securities portfolio has decreased $0.4 billion, or 8.5%, to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2024 from $4.9 billion at December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to sales of AFS securities of $1.1 billion and maturities and principal paydowns of AFS and HTM securities of $0.4 billion. Included in this activity are principal paydowns and proceeds from the sale of securities acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge of $883.0 million, representing all of the securities acquired at fair value. All acquired securities paid down or were sold immediately following the completion of the merger. No gain or loss was recognized upon the sale as the securities were marked to fair value in connection with our purchase accounting based upon quoted sale prices. Partially offsetting these items were purchases of AFS securities of $199.5 million.
We did not have trading investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
A portion of our securities portfolio continues to be tax-exempt. Investments in federally tax-exempt securities totaled $183.1 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $191.1 million at December 31, 2023.
Our AFS securities are carried at fair value and are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of model inputs. Securities which require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no securities categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

The following tables show contractual maturities of our AFS and HTM securities and weighted average yields at and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Maturities of our securities portfolio are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the effect of scheduled principal repayments, prepayments, or early redemptions that may occur. Weighted average yields in the tables below have been calculated based on the amortized cost of the security:

Investment security weighted-average yields were calculated on a level-yield basis by weighting the tax equivalent yield for each security type by the book value of each maturity category.
The yield on tax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions has been adjusted to a fully-taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis by adjusting tax-exempt income upward by an amount equivalent to the prevailing federal income taxes that would have been paid if the income had been fully taxable.

We consider our loan portfolio to be relatively diversified by borrower and industry. Our loans increased $4.1 billion, or 29.4%, to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2024 from $14.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase as of December 31, 2024 was primarily due to loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge. Refer to 
Note 3, “Mergers and Acquisitions”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. Excluding the addition of acquired loans, our gross loans increased $171.0 million, or 1.2%, which was primarily attributable to increased balances of business banking and consumer home equity loans.
•
Excluding Cambridge-acquired loans, our business banking portfolio increased by $242.0 million, or 22.3%, from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 which was primarily due to transfers from our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios. These transfers contributed to an overall decrease in the total balance of our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios and were partially offset by originations in those portfolios. In the normal course of business, loans are transferred from our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios to our business banking portfolio once the loan balances reach a certain dollar threshold.
•
Excluding Cambridge-acquired loans, our consumer home equity portfolio increased by $89.4 million, or 7.4%, from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 which was primarily due to additional draws by borrowers on home equity lines of credit.
We believe that our commercial loan portfolio composition is relatively diversified in terms of industry sectors, property types and various lending specialties. As of December 31, 2024, the amortized cost balances of concentrations in our commercial loan portfolios were as follows:

We believe that the loan to value ratio (“LTV”) is an important factor in monitoring the risk characteristics of our loans secured by real estate. The following tables show the distribution of loan balances, on an amortized cost basis, by LTV and year of origination for each of our portfolios of loans secured by real estate as of December 31, 2024:

The interest rate risk of our loan portfolio is an important element in the management of net interest margin. We attempt to manage the relationship between the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to produce an effective interest differential that is not significantly impacted by changes in the level of interest rates.

Asset quality.
 We continually monitor the asset quality of our loan portfolio utilizing portfolio scorecards and various credit quality indicators. Based on this process, loans meeting certain criteria are categorized as delinquent or non-performing and further assessed to determine if non-accrual status is appropriate.
For the commercial portfolio, which includes our commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking loans, we monitor credit quality using a risk rating scale, which assigns a risk-grade to each borrower based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors associated with a commercial loan transaction. Management utilizes a loan risk rating methodology based on a 15-point scale with the assistance of risk rating scorecard tools. Pass grades are 0-10 and non-pass categories, which align with regulatory guidelines, are: special mention (11), substandard (12), doubtful (13) and loss (14).
Risk rating assignment is determined using one of 15 separate scorecards developed for distinctive portfolio segments based on common attributes. Key factors include: industry and market conditions, position within the industry, earnings trends, operating cash flow, asset/liability values, debt capacity, guarantor strength, management and controls, financial reporting, collateral and other considerations.
Special mention, substandard and doubtful loans totaled 4.9% and 4.1% of total commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was driven by several risk rating downgrades of loans in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios.
Our philosophy toward managing our loan portfolios is predicated upon careful monitoring, which stresses early detection and response to delinquent and default situations. We seek to make arrangements to resolve any delinquent or default situation over the shortest possible time frame.
For the retail portfolio, which includes residential real estate, consumer home equity, and other consumer portfolios, we monitor credit quality using the borrower’s FICO score. As of December 31, 2024, 72.0% of retail borrowers, based on amortized cost balances, have a FICO score of 740 or greater. The following table shows the balances by borrowers’ current FICO scores as of the dates indicated:

As a general rule, loans more than 90 days past due with respect to principal or interest are classified as non-accrual loans. However, based on our assessment of collateral and/or payment prospects, certain loans that are more than 90 days past due may be kept on an accruing status. Income accruals are suspended on all non-accrual loans and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current income. A loan is expected to remain on non-accrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest, the loan is liquidated, or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses.
Non-performing assets (“NPAs”) are comprised of non-performing loans (“NPLs”), OREO and non-performing securities. NPLs consist of non-accrual loans and loans that are more than 90 days past due but still accruing interest. OREO consists of real estate properties, which primarily serve as collateral to secure our loans, that we control due to foreclosure. These properties are recorded at the fair value less estimated costs to sell on the date we obtain control. Any write-downs to the cost of the related asset upon transfer to OREO to reflect the asset at fair value less estimated costs to sell is recorded through the allowance for loan losses.
NPLs increased $83.3 million, or 158%, to $135.8 million at December 31, 2024 from $52.6 million at December 31, 2023. NPLs as a percentage of total loans increased to 0.76% at December 31, 2024 from 0.38% at December 31, 2023. Refer to the later 
“Allowance for Credit Losses”
 section in this Item 7 for a discussion of the change in non-accrual loans which comprise our NPLs as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
The total amount of interest recorded on NPLs during both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not significant. The gross interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of those loans if they had been performing amounted to $8.8 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
In the course of resolving NPLs, we may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. We attempt to work-out alternative payment schedules with the borrowers in order to avoid foreclosure actions. The aggregate amortized cost balance as of December 31, 2024 of loans modified during the year ended December 31, 2024 which were determined to be modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was $30.7 million. Included in such modifications were four commercial real estate loans collateralized by properties in our office risk segment. The aggregate amortized cost balance as of December 31, 2023 of loans modified during the year ended December 31, 2023 which were determined to be modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was $19.4 million. 
As of December 31, 2024, there were three loans with an aggregate balance of $0.5 million that had been modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the during the twelve-month period then ended which had subsequently defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, there were no loans that had been modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the twelve-month period then ended which had subsequently defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Our policy is that any restructured loan, which is on non-accrual status prior to being modified, remain on non-accrual status for approximately six months subsequent to being modified before we consider its return to accrual status. If the restructured loan is on accrual status prior to being modified, we review it to determine if the modified loan should remain on accrual status.
Purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans are loans that we acquired that have shown evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and, therefore, it was deemed unlikely that all contractually required payments would be collected upon the merger date. We consider factors such as payment history, collateral values and accrual status when determining whether there was evidence of deterioration at the merger date. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
64
the carrying amount of PCD loans was $331.4 million and $49.1 million, respectively. The increase in PCD loans was due to our acquisition of PCD loans in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with our merger with Cambridge which was completed on July 12, 2024 and which added $356.1 million in PCD loans on a gross amortized cost basis.
Potential Problem Loans. 
In the normal course of business, we become aware of possible credit problems in which borrowers exhibit the potential to be unable to comply in the future with the contractual terms of their loans, but which currently do not yet meet the criteria for classification as NPLs. These loans are neither delinquent nor on non-accrual status. Our potential problem loans, or loans with potential weaknesses that were not included in the non-accrual loans or in the loans 90 or more past due categories, increased by $38.3 million, or 10.2%, to $412.0 million at December 31, 2024 from $373.7 million at December 31, 2023. These loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 2.3% at December 31, 2024 from 2.7% at December 31, 2023. The increase in potential problem loans from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the downgrade of certain commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans during the year ended December 31, 2024, including certain commercial real estate loans collateralized by properties in the office risk segment, and the addition of certain loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge. Refer to the below 
“Commercial Real Estate Office Exposure”
 section of this Item 7 for additional information.
Commercial Real Estate Office Exposure.

Our total office-related commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans (which is comprised of loans within our commercial real estate and construction portfolios that are secured by office space, medical office space, and mixed-use properties where rental income is primarily from office space) totaled $1.0 billion and $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in this total as of December 31, 2024 were loans with a balance of $288.1 million which were acquired during year ended December 31, 2024 in connection with our merger with Cambridge. As of December 31, 2024, our office-related CRE loans are primarily concentrated in Massachusetts, where approximately 92.1% of the total recorded investment balance of office-related CRE loans are located, and approximately 20.4% of the total recorded investment balance of office-related CRE loans are located in the City of Boston.
Given prevailing market conditions such as reduced occupancy as a result of the increase in hybrid and fully remote work arrangements post-COVID and lower commercial real estate valuations, we are carefully monitoring these loans for signs of deterioration in credit quality. Such monitoring includes incremental risk management strategies undertaken by management including monthly internal CRE office exposure portfolio reporting, more frequent portfolio reviews, ongoing monitoring of market conditions, and additional portfolio analysis such as maturity risk analysis and rent rollover risk analysis. As of December 31, 2024, twelve of our office-related CRE loans, which had a total recorded investment balance of $87.0 million, were on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2023, two of our office-related CRE loans were on non-accrual status and had a total recorded investment balance of $14.0 million.

Allowance for credit losses. 
For the purpose of estimating our allowance for loan losses, we segregate the loan portfolio into loan categories, for loans that share similar risk characteristics, that possess unique risk characteristics such as loan purpose, repayment source, and collateral that are considered when determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses for each category. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans are evaluated individually.
While we use available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions or subtractions to/from the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in NPLs, changes in economic conditions, or other reasons. Additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of our examination process, periodically assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to assess whether the allowance for loan losses was determined in accordance with GAAP and applicable guidance.
We perform an evaluation of our allowance for loan losses on a regular basis (at least quarterly), and establish the allowance for loan losses based upon an evaluation of our loan categories, as each possesses unique risk characteristics that are considered when determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses, including:
•
known increases in concentrations within each category;
•
certain higher risk classes of loans, or pledged collateral;
•
historical loan loss experience within each category;
•
results of any independent review and evaluation of the category’s credit quality;
•
trends in volume, maturity and composition of each category;
•
volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals;
•
national and local economic conditions and downturns in specific local industries;
•
corporate goals and objectives;
•
lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices; and
•
current and forecasted banking industry conditions, as well as the regulatory and competitive environment.
Loans are evaluated on a regular basis by management. Expected lifetime losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics and are determined using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. For commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking portfolios, the quantitative model uses a loan rating system which is comprised of management’s determination of probability of default, or PD, loss given default, or LGD, and exposure at default, or EAD, which are derived from historical loss experience and other factors. For residential real estate, consumer home equity and other consumer portfolios, our quantitative model uses historical loss experience.
The allowance for loan losses is allocated to loan categories using both a formula-based approach and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment. We use a methodology to systematically estimate the amount of expected credit loss in the loan portfolio. Under our current methodology, the allowance for loan losses contains reserves related to loans for which 
66
the related allowance for loan losses is determined on an individual loan basis and on a collective basis, and other qualitative components.
The allowance for loan losses increased by $80.0 million, or 53.7%, to $229.0 million, or 1.29% of total loans, at December 31, 2024 from $149.0 million, or 1.07% of total loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to our merger with Cambridge, which was completed on July 12, 2024. In connection with the merger, we recorded an allowance for acquired PCD loans of $55.8 million, as a gross-up of the corresponding loan balance, and an allowance for acquired non-PCD loans of $40.9 million, recognized through the provision for allowance for loan losses immediately following the completion of the merger. Excluding these amounts, the allowance for loan losses decreased by $16.7 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. For further discussion of the change in the allowance for loan losses and the provision for allowance for loans losses, refer to 
Note 5, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become payable. The credit risk associated with these commitments is evaluated in a manner similar to the reserving method for loans receivable previously described. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our reserve for unfunded lending commitments decreased by $1.0 million, or 7%, to $13.1 million at December 31, 2024 from $14.1 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower reserve rates and unfunded balances within the commercial construction portfolio, which were attributable to an improved economic forecast and draws by borrowers which served to reduce unfunded balances. The decrease in our reserve for unfunded lending commitments contributed to a decrease in our other non-interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Non-accrual loans increased $83.3 million, or 158%, to $135.8 million at December 31, 2024 from $52.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to loans acquired from Cambridge and which were already on non-accrual or were transferred to non-accrual following the completion of the merger. As of December 31, 2024, the amount of loans on non-accrual which were acquired from Cambridge was $59.3 million. For additional information regarding the credit quality of our loans, see

To determine if a loan should be charged-off, all possible sources of repayment are analyzed. Possible sources of repayment include the potential for future cash flows, liquidation of the collateral and the strength of co-makers or guarantors. When available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged-off against the allowance for loan losses and any recoveries of such previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
Regardless of whether a loan is unsecured or collateralized, we charge off the amount of any confirmed loan loss in the period when the loans, or portions of loans, are deemed uncollectible. For troubled, collateral-dependent loans, loss

confirming events may include an appraisal or other valuation that reflects a shortfall between the value of the collateral and the carrying value of the loan or receivable, or a deficiency balance following the sale of the collateral.
For additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses, see 
Note 5, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Federal Home Loan Bank stock
The FHLBB is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for our membership in the FHLBB is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding and as a tool to manage interest rate risk. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. We purchase and/or are subject to redemption of FHLBB stock proportional to the volume of funding received and view the holdings as a necessary long-term investment for the purpose of balance sheet liquidity and not for investment return.
We held an investment in the FHLBB of $5.9 million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amount of stock we are required to purchase is in proportional to our FHLB borrowings and level of total assets.

The balance of our goodwill and other intangible assets was $1.1 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was due to our merger with Cambridge during the third quarter of 2024. Refer to 
Note 3, “Mergers and Acquisitions”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. We did not record any impairment to our goodwill or other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For discussion of the impairment testing performed, refer to 
Note 8, “Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangible Asset”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities
Deposits originating within the markets we serve continue to be our primary source of funding our earning assets. Historically, we have been able to compete effectively for deposits in our primary market areas. The distribution and market share of deposits by type of deposit and type of depositor are important considerations in our assessment of the stability of our funding sources and our access to additional funds. Furthermore, we shift the mix and maturity of the deposits depending on economic conditions and loan and investment policies in an attempt, within set policies, to minimize cost and maximize net interest margin.

Deposits increased by $3.7 billion, or 21.0%, to $21.3 billion at December 31, 2024 from $17.6 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the addition of deposits acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge, which was completed on July 12, 2024. Excluding the acquired deposit balances, deposits decreased $178.3 million, or 1.0%, at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the balances of omnibus deposit accounts which decreased $285.3 million from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 and which contributed to the decrease in interest checking deposits, excluding the impact of our merger with Cambridge. Further, the remaining changes, which taken together comprise an overall increase, reflect organic deposit growth and a continued shift in deposit mix from non-interest-bearing/low-yielding deposit accounts to interest-bearing/higher-yielding deposit account types during the year ended December 31, 2024. The shift in deposit mix was due primarily to increases in rates paid on money market investment deposits and certificates of deposit, which attracted depositors to such products.
The Bank’s estimate of total uninsured deposits was $9.0 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In accordance with the FDIC’s Call Report instructions, these estimates include accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries, the holding company, and internal operating deposit accounts (together referred to as “internal deposit accounts”). In addition, these estimates include municipal deposit accounts for which securities were pledged by us to secure such deposits (“collateralized deposits”). For liquidity monitoring purposes, we exclude internal deposit accounts and collateralized deposits from our estimate of uninsured deposits. Our estimate of uninsured deposits, excluding internal deposit accounts and collateralized deposits, was $6.9 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Our total borrowings increased by $45.7 million to $93.9 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $48.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased balances of interest rate swap collateral funds. Refer to the later 
“Liquidity, Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies”
 section in this Item 7 for additional discussion of our liquidity position.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Interest and Dividend Income
Interest and dividend income increased by $150.3 million, or 18.9%, to $946.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $796.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio and our yields and was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on securities and other short-term investments.
•
Interest income on loans increased $155.9 million, or 23.9%, to $808.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $652.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in interest income on our loans was due to an increase in the average balance of our loans and an increase in the yield on our loans. The average balance of our loans increased $2.0 billion, or 14.3%, to $15.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $13.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily due to loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge of $3.7 billion. The increase in yield, which increased 39 basis points to 5.22% during the year ended December 31, 2024, from 4.83% during the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to accretion of the discount on loans acquired in our merger with Cambridge, increases in market rates of interest which resulted in increased yields on variable rate loans which repriced, and new loans originated at higher rates of interest.
•
Interest income on securities and other short-term investments decreased by $5.6 million, or 3.9%, to $138.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $144.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the average balance of our securities and other short-term investments, which decreased $0.8 billion, or 11.2%, to $6.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $7.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in the average balance was primarily due to our sales of AFS securities during the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as maturities and principal paydowns on AFS and HTM securities. Partially offsetting the decrease in the average balance of our securities and other short-term investments, and contributing to the overall increase in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2024, was an increase in our yield on our securities and other short-term investments which increased 16 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2024 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the rate paid on our cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from an average of 5.10% during the year ended December 31, 2023 to an average of 5.21% during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $93.1 million to $339.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $246.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The overall increase was attributable to an increase in deposit interest expense partially offset by a decrease in borrowings interest expense.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense on our interest-bearing deposits increased by $111.3 million to $337.4 million from $226.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2024, average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 9.8%, to $14.1 billion, from $12.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of our merger with Cambridge which added approximately $2.9 billion in interest-bearing deposits. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in rates paid on deposits. Rates paid on deposits increased by 63 basis points to 2.40% during the year ended December 31, 2024 from 1.77% during the year ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily due to our increasing overall deposit rates paid in response to an increase in market rates of interest and heightened industry-wide competition for deposits, as well as a shift in deposit mix from lower interest-bearing account types to higher interest-bearing account types. 
Interest expense related to our borrowings decreased by $18.2 million to $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $20.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in borrowings interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to a decrease in our utilization of our FHLB borrowing capacity. Our utilization of FHLBB borrowings was greater during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2024 as we had bolstered our on-balance sheet liquidity in response to the bank failures in the first quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we paid down our FHLB advances primarily with the proceeds from the sale of our insurance agency business, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. Both of these factors resulted in a reduced average balance of borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Net Interest Income
73
Net interest income increased by $57.2 million, or 10.4%, to $607.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, from $550.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. Net interest income increased due to a increase in the balance of average total interest-earning assets of $1.2 billion, or 5.7%, to $22.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $20.8 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as an increase in our net interest margin during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The following chart shows our net interest margin over the past five years:
Net interest margin is determined by dividing FTE net interest income by average-earning assets. For purposes of the following discussion, income from tax-exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to an FTE basis, using a marginal tax rate of 21.8%, 21.8%, and 21.6% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Net interest margin increased 12 basis points basis points to 2.85% during the year ended December 31, 2024, from 2.73% during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 from the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in the average balance and yield on interest-earning assets which exceeded the increase in the cost of our interest-earning liabilities.
74
The following tables set forth average balance sheet items, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances in the table reflect daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees and costs, and discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. Average asset and liability balances included in discontinued operations are included in non-interest-earnings assets and liabilities, respectively.

Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses represents the charge to expense that is required to maintain an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses.
We recorded a provision for allowance for loan losses of $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a provision of $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a provision for allowance for loan losses of $40.9 million related to non-PCD loans acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge which closed on July 12, 2024. Excluding this amount, the provision for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $26.5 million. Management determined a provision to be necessary for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to $42.6 million in charge-offs of commercial real estate loans and due to an increase in specific reserves for commercial real estate loans collateralized by property in the office risk segment. Included in charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $41.3 million of charge-offs on loans collateralized by property in the office risk segment which transitioned to non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2024 and had not been previously reserved for on a specific reserve basis, and $19.8 million of charge-offs on PCD loans acquired in the merger with Cambridge.        
Management’s estimate of our allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2024 and the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2024, was supported, in part, by Oxford Economics’ December 2024 Baseline forecast (“the forecast”) which was used to develop management’s estimate of the effect of expected future economic conditions on the allowance for loan losses. The forecast assumed U.S. economic growth in 2025 will be consistent with 2024 as U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) will grow by 2.6%. This forecast reflects the impact of steady consumer spending but a slight increase in the unemployment rate. Primary macroeconomic assumptions included in management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses included a rise in the unemployment rate and a slight decline in the growth rate of U.S. GDP. Further, the forecast assumed that the FOMC will decrease federal funds rates several times in 2025. Refer to the section titled 
“Outlook and Trends”
 within this Item 7 for additional discussion. For additional discussion of our allowance for credit losses measurement methodology, see 
Note 5, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
To illustrate the sensitivity of the modeled result to the impact of a hypothetical change in the economic forecast, management calculated the allowance for loan losses assuming the downside economic forecast scenario and, separately, the upside economic forecast scenario. The downside scenario assumed the U.S. economy will experience a slight growth in GDP in 2025 of 0.1%. Use of the downside scenario would have resulted in an incremental increase in the allowance for loan losses of approximately $16.9 million as of December 31, 2024. The upside scenario assumed GDP growth of 3.3% in 2025 along with sustained recovery. Use of the upside scenario would have resulted in an incremental decrease in the allowance for loan losses of approximately $6.3 million as of December 31, 2024. 
77
Our periodic evaluation of the appropriate allowance for loan losses considers the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and trends in loan delinquencies and charge-offs.

Noninterest income increased $361.7 million, or 152.1%, to $123.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from a net loss of $237.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a $316.4 million decrease in losses on sales of securities available for sale, a $21.9 million increase in trust and investment advisory fees, a $15.4 million increase in other noninterest income, and a $3.4 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts.
•
We recorded losses of $16.8 million and $333.2 million on sales of securities available for sale, net, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
◦
In the second quarter of 2024, an early withdrawal of an omnibus deposit contract occurred which had a balance of $100.0 million at the time of the contract termination. Management made the decision to sell certain available for sale securities following the early termination in order to recoup liquidity.
◦
In July 2024, following our merger with Cambridge, we sold all securities that we had acquired through the merger. However, such securities had been adjusted to fair value in connection with our merger purchase accounting based upon the quoted sale price. As such, no gain or loss was recognized from the sale of such securities.  
◦
In the fourth quarter of 2024, management made the decision to sell lower yielding available for sale securities at a loss to offset a gain recognized upon sale of an other equity investment we sold in the fourth quarter of 2024.
◦
We recorded losses during the year ended December 31, 2023 as management made the decision to sell certain available for sale securities in connection with a balance sheet repositioning in March 2023.
•
Trust and investment advisory fees increased due to an increase in our assets under management, which increased due to an increase in our wealth management and trust operations as a result of our merger with Cambridge through which we acquired $5.0 billion in assets held in a fiduciary, custodial or agency capacity for customers.
•
Other noninterest income increased primarily as a result of a $9.3 million gain on sale of an other equity investment held by us, as described above. Also contributing to the increase was $7.8 million of fee income received as a result of the early withdrawal of an omnibus deposit contract which had a balance of $100.0 million, as described above.
•
Service charges on deposit accounts increased primarily as a result of increased corporate account analysis charges as a result of an increase in our account analysis service prices charged to customers during the year ended December 31, 2024.

We recorded merger and acquisition expenses of $36.7 million and $5.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to our merger with Cambridge. These columns display the period-over-period change in merger and acquisition expenses by financial statement line item and the change in account balances excluding such amounts.
Noninterest expense increased by $89.8 million, or 21.4%, to $508.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $418.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in merger and acquisition expenses of $31.2 million and the following items, which exclude merger and acquisition expenses: a $34.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $16.5 million increase in data processing, a $12.8 million increase in amortization of intangible assets, and a $5.9 million increase in office occupancy and equipment. These increases were partially offset by a $8.0 million decrease in FDIC insurance expenses.
•
Merger and acquisition expenses increased as our merger with Cambridge was completed in the third quarter of 2024 around such time the majority of the related expenses were incurred.
•
Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages expense, an increase in share-based compensation, an increase in pension service cost.
◦
Salaries and wages expense, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased $20.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of our merger with Cambridge as well as regular annual wage increases.
◦
Share-based compensation, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased due to an increase in the number of employees in the “2021 Equity Plan”, which was the result of our merger with Cambridge, as well as additional restricted stock awards granted to two new executives who were hired during the year ended December 31, 2024.
◦
Pension service cost primarily increased due to an increase in the number of employees enrolled in our Defined Benefit Plan during the year ended December 31, 2024. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in the interest crediting rate on cash balance accounts in the plan during the year ended December 31, 2024.  
•
Data processing, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily as a result of a increase in software expenses, which were primarily driven by an increase in cybersecurity software expenses. The increase in these expenses was driven by efforts to improve our cybersecurity technology to better protect against cybersecurity threats. 
•
Amortization of intangible assets increased primarily due to an increase in intangible assets in connection with our merger with Cambridge, resulting in a corresponding increase in amortization expense.
•
Office

occupancy and equipment, excluding merger and acquisition expenses, increased primarily due to the addition of properties resulting from our merger with Cambridge.
79
•
FDIC insurance expenses

decreased primarily due to the FDIC's special assessment for which the majority was accrued for in the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2023, the FDIC announced that, as required by the FDIA, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a special assessment. On November 16, 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register its final rule that imposes special assessments to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023, following the closures of SVB and Signature Bank, as required by the FDIA. We recognized the special assessment estimate of $10.8 million in full upon finalization of the rule in the fourth quarter of 2023. In June 2024, we received the FDIC’s additional special assessment invoice, which included an incremental assessment amount of $1.9 million. We recorded this amount during the second quarter of 2024.  
Income Taxes
We recognize the tax effect of all income and expense transactions in each year’s consolidated statements of income, regardless of the year in which the transactions are reported for income tax purposes. The following table sets forth information regarding our tax provision included in continuing operations and applicable tax rates for the periods indicated:

Income tax expense increased by $99.5 million to expense of $36.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 from a benefit of $63.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase to net expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to pre-tax losses resulting from losses on sales available for sale securities in the first quarter of 2023. Also contributing to the increase was a $7.4 million expense recorded in 2024 for the lost state tax benefit associated with the 2024 Massachusetts state tax net operating loss which cannot be carried over. The state tax net operating losses were due to the tax losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of the securities acquired in connection with our merger with Cambridge.
During the first quarter of 2023, we liquidated Market Street Securities Corporation (“MSSC”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and transferred all of MSSC’s assets to Eastern Bank. In connection with the liquidation and subsequent transfer of securities previously held by MSSC to Eastern Bank, the Company recognized an additional deferred income tax benefit of $23.7 million. This deferred income tax benefit resulted from a state tax rate change applied to the deferred tax asset related to the securities transferred to Eastern Bank.

Note 13, “Income Taxes” 
within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
While our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in 
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Allowance for Loan Losses
. The allowance for credit losses, or ACL, is established to provide for our current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost and unfunded lending commitments at the balance sheet date and is established through a provision for credit losses charged to net income.
Management uses a methodology to systematically estimate the amount of expected lifetime losses in the portfolio. Expected lifetime losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics and are 
80
determined using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. For commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking portfolios, the quantitative model uses a loan rating system which is comprised of management’s determination of a financial asset’s probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) and exposure at default (“EAD”), which are derived from historical loss experience and other factors. For residential real estate, consumer home equity and other consumer portfolios, our quantitative model uses historical loss experience. 
The quantitative model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the estimated life of the exposure, considering the effect of prepayments. Economic forecasts, one of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL, are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of eight quarters, beyond which is a reversion to our historical loss average which occurs over a period of four quarters. 
For further discussion of management’s economic forecast assumptions and our sensitivity analysis of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2024, refer to the earlier 
“Provision for Loan Losses”
 discussion within the 
“Results of Operations”
 within this Item 7. For additional information on our allowance for loan losses, refer to 
Note 5, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Goodwill.
 Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, which we performed as of September 30, 2024, using a quantitative impairment approach. Following management’s decision to change its annual assessment date, we performed an assessment as of November 30, 2024, described further below. For additional information regarding the change in annual assessment date, refer to 
Note 8, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An assessment is also performed to the extent relevant events and/or circumstances occur which may indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The quantitative impairment test compares the book value to the fair value of each reporting unit. If the book value exceeds the fair value, an impairment is charged to net income. As of December 31, 2024, management identified one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment: the banking business.
We performed our annual assessment of impairment for the banking business as of September 30, 2024. The assessment included a comparison of the banking reporting unit’s carrying value of equity to estimated fair value of equity using the market capitalization method of the market approach. We evaluated conditions as of the assessment date and how a market participant would evaluate a control premium for the banking reporting unit. The implied control premium was estimated using the discounted cash flow method of the income approach by evaluating the present value of market participant cost savings and synergies. Based upon the assessment, we determined there was no impairment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2024.
In addition, following management’s decision to change the date at which our annual impairment assessment is performed, we performed our annual assessment for the banking business as of November 30, 2024, our new annual assessment date. The assessment included a comparison of the banking reporting unit’s carrying value of equity to estimated fair value of equity based on our market capitalization. The assessment also considered the changes in market conditions from the September 30, 2024 assessment. Based upon the assessment, it was determined there was no impairment of our goodwill as of November 30, 2024. Refer to 
Note 8, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the change in annual impairment assessment date.
Significant management judgment is necessary in the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit as the estimated fair value of equity and of the implied control premium requires estimation of future cash flows and the evaluation of the present value of market participant cost savings and synergies. The determination of fair value is a highly subjective process, and actual future cash flows may differ from forecasted results.
Our discount rate was based upon the estimated cost of equity under the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, size premium, company specific premium and beta specific to a particular reporting unit.
For additional information on our goodwill and other intangibles, refer to 
Note 8, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Combinations
. As indicated above, acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the related transaction costs expensed in the period incurred. We use third party valuation specialists to assist in the determination of fair value of certain assets and liabilities at the merger date, 
81
including loans, core deposit intangibles, customer list intangibles, trade name intangibles and time deposits. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, the estimates are inherently uncertain. For further discussion of our methodology for estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in connection with our merger with Cambridge, see 
Note 3, “Mergers and Acquisitions”
 within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The allowance for credit losses on PCD loans is recognized within business combination accounting. The allowance for credit losses on non-PCD loans is recognized as a provision expense in the same period as the business combination. For further discussion of our accounting policies for estimating credit losses on acquired loans, see 
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”
 within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Income Taxes
. We account for income taxes by establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates. We make significant judgments regarding the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. This requires subjective projections of future taxable income resulting from interest on loans and securities, as well as noninterest income. A valuation allowance is established if it is considered more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Interest and penalties paid on the underpayment of income taxes are classified as income tax expense.
We periodically evaluate the potential uncertainty of our tax positions as to whether it is more-likely-than-not its position would be upheld upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that we believe is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.
For additional information on our income taxes, refer to 
Note 13, “Income Taxes”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Pension and other Post Retirement Benefit Plans
. For information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans including our pension contributions, investment strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligation and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments, refer to 
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”
 and 
Note 15, “Employee Benefits”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan (“Defined Benefit Plan”), a discount rate, lump sum conversion rates, compensation and benefit limitation increase assumptions, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets that is utilized in determining Defined Benefit Plan pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, investment policy, amount and types of expenses that will be paid from the Defined Benefit Plan, and the expected long-term return for the Defined Benefit Plan using recent forward looking capital market assumptions published by leading financial organizations. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
In November 2024, an investment policy study was completed for the Defined Benefit Plan. As a result of the study, it was determined that the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets of 7.25% was reasonable as of December 31, 2024.
Another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for all pension plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along the Financial Times Stock Exchange (“FTSE”) above-median yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
For our Defined Benefit Plan and the Non-Qualified Benefit Equalization Plan, the interest rates used to convert annuities to the actuarial equivalent lump sum amounts were selected based on the applicable segment rates under Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e) and rounded up to the nearest 25 basis points to account for the increase in bond yields during December 2024.
The Society of Actuaries (“SOA”) most recently issued mortality improvement tables during the year ended December 31, 2021. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions were appropriate to measure our pension plan obligations as of December 31, 2024.
Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in 
82
unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on all of our pension plans was $34.1 million and $69.7 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The year-over-year change was primarily due to an increase in plan assets and an increase in discount rates, partially offset by a decrease in lump sum conversion rates assumptions used for determining the benefit obligation.
The overfunded status of all of our pension plans improved during the year ended December 31, 2024 to $110.9 million from $69.0 million primarily due to: (i) actual pension plan investment returns greater than expected of $12.7 million; and (ii) the favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $22.2 million; partially offset by (iii) changes in other actuarial assumptions and demographic data updates; and (iv) the unfavorable effect of a decrease in lump sum conversion rates of $0.3 million.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Relevant standards that we adopted during the year ended December 31, 2024:
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, 
Investments–Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method 
(“ASU 2023-02”). This update permits reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if the following conditions are met:
1.
It is probable that the income tax credits allocable to the tax equity investor will be available.
2.
The tax equity investor does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the underlying project.
3.
Substantially all of the projected benefits are from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. Projected benefits include income tax credits, other income tax benefits, and other non-income-tax-related benefits. The projected benefits are determined on a discounted basis, using a discount rate that is consistent with the cash flow assumptions used by the tax equity investor in making its decision to invest in the project.
4.
The tax equity investor’s projected yield based solely on the cash flows from the income tax credits and other income tax benefits is positive.
5.
The tax equity investor is a limited liability investor in the limited liability entity for both legal and tax purposes, and the tax equity investor’s liability is limited to its capital investment.
Under previously effective accounting standards, the proportional amortization method was allowable only for equity investments in low-income-housing tax credit structures. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). Updates made by ASU 2023-02 allow a reporting entity to make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis. The Company had previously made an accounting policy election to account for its investments in low-income-housing tax credit investments using the proportional amortization method. This election was made upon the Company’s adoption of ASU 2014-01, 
Investments–Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects
, which 
83
introduced the option to apply proportional amortization to low-income-housing tax credit investments
.
 We adopted this standard on January 1, 2024 and such adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The amendments in this update are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update:
1.
Require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss (collectively referred to as the “significant expense principle”).
2.
Require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. The other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss.
3.
Require that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
 in interim periods.
4.
Clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit. However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements. In other words, in addition to the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles under U.S. GAAP, a public entity is not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss that are used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
5.
Require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
6.
Require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Relevant standards that were recently issued but which we had not yet adopted as of December 31, 2024:
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, 
Disclosure Improvements–Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative
 (“ASU 2023-06”)
.
 The amendments in this update modify the disclosure or presentation requirements for a variety of topics in the codification. Certain amendments represent clarifications to or technical corrections of the current requirements. The following is a summary of the topics included in the update and which pertain to the Company:
1.
Statement of cash flows (Topic 230): Requires an accounting policy disclosure in annual periods of where cash flows associated with derivative instruments and their related gains and loses are presented in the statement of cash flows;
2.
Accounting changes and error corrections (Topic 250): Requires that when there has been a change in the reporting entity, the entity disclose any material prior-period adjustment and the effect of the adjustment on retained earnings in interim financial statements;
3.
Earnings per share (Topic 260): Requires disclosure of the methods used in the diluted earnings-per-share computation for each dilutive security and clarifies that certain disclosures should be made during interim periods, and amends illustrative guidance to illustrate disclosure of the methods used in the diluted earnings per share computation;
4.
Commitments (Topic 440): Requires disclosure of assets mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise subject to lien and the obligations collateralized; and
5.
Debt (Topic 470): Requires disclosure of amounts and terms of unused lines of credit and unfunded commitments and the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding short-term borrowings.
For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2023-06 are effective on the date which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation and S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the codification and will not become effective for any entity. Early adoption is not permitted and the 
84
amendments are required to be applied on a prospective basis. We expect the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The amendments in this update are intended to improve income tax disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures related to the existing requirements to disclose a rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and certain other required disclosures. Specifically, the amendments in this update:

Management of Market Risk
General.
 Market risk is the sensitivity of the net present value of assets and liabilities and/or income to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and other market-driven rates or prices. Interest rate sensitivity is the most significant market risk to which we are exposed. Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of the net present value of assets and liabilities and income to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates, as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of assets and liabilities, affect net interest income, our primary source of income. Interest rate risk arises directly from our core banking activities. In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the amount of loans originated, the timing of cash flows on loans and securities, and the fair value of assets and liabilities, as well as other aspects of our business.
Governance.
 The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to attempt to control this risk within policy limits approved by the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors (“RMC”), and within the Risk Appetite Statement formally adopted by the Board of Directors and described further below. 
85
These limits reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons, are designed to encompass market rate shocks that would take place with both gradual and immediate effect and cover a range of scenarios from mild to extreme market shocks. More specifically, and as further described below, our policy limits govern:
•
The maximum amount of acceptable earnings loss due to market risk in year one of a two-year earnings simulation, determined by net interest income analysis;
•
The maximum amount of acceptable earnings loss due to market risk in year two of a two-year earnings simulation, determined by net interest income analysis;
•
The maximum amount of acceptable decline in the present value of equity due to market risk, determined by economic value of equity analysis;
•
The maximum acceptable size of the investment portfolio relative to total assets;
•
Concentration limits on investment asset types to ensure appropriate portfolio diversification;
•
Maximum maturity and weighted average life per security at time of purchase in both a base case and a shocked rate scenario to measure extension risk;
•
The maximum acceptable duration of the investment and hedging derivatives portfolio; and
•
Guidelines on accounting classification of securities including held for trading, available for sale and held to maturity.
Policy limits are tested quarterly, and the results are reported to the Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is a subcommittee of management’s Enterprise Risk Management Committee (“ERMC”), and to RMC. RMC advises the Board of Directors with respect to the adequacy of capital allocated based on the level of risk as well as risk issues that could impact liquidity and/or capital adequacy. From time to time, we expect we will exceed policy limits, in which case we may seek corrective action after considering, among other things, market conditions, customer reaction, and the estimated impact on profitability. A remediation plan will be presented to ALCO, ERMC and RMC that carefully outlines the proposed corrective action.
We attempt to manage interest rate risk by identifying, quantifying, and where appropriate, hedging our exposure to market risk. If assets and liabilities do not re-price simultaneously and in equal volume, the potential for interest rate exposure exists. Our objective is to maintain stability in the growth of net interest income through the maintenance of an appropriate mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and, when necessary and within limits that management determines to be prudent, through the use of off-balance sheet hedging instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, floors and caps.
Our asset-liability management strategy is devised and monitored by our ALCO in accordance with policies approved by RMC. ALCO operates under a charter developed and approved by ERMC. ALCO meets monthly, or more frequently as needed, to review, among other things, our sensitivity to interest rate changes, loan pricing and activity, investment activity and strategy, hedging strategies, deposit pricing and funding strategies with respect to overall balance sheet composition, as well as earnings simulations over multiple years. ALCO may meet more frequently if there are changes in the economic environment, such as rapid increases or decreases in interest rates due to or as a result of exogenous or unknown factors so that ALCO can make any necessary strategic adjustments to better manage interest rate risk. ALCO’s membership is comprised of executive management of the Company, and representatives from various lines of business are in regular attendance, including representation from Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”). ALCO reports regularly to RMC on these risks and objectives with independent oversight and reporting from our Financial and Model Risk Management group within ERM.
As a company offering banking and other financial services, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make. We, therefore, encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks. In its oversight of our risk management framework, the Board of Directors has adopted a formal Risk Appetite Statement (“RAS”) which defines the aggregate level of risk and the types of risk the Company is willing to assume to achieve its corporate strategy and objectives. The Board of Directors regularly assesses whether the approved policy limits, as described further above, conform to stated risk appetite. The Board of Directors monitors, on at least a quarterly basis, a set of key risk metrics, including those, but not limited to those, pertaining to market risk. Monitoring these metrics can help to identify trends in risk profile or emerging risks over time, and where applicable, determine where adjustments may be required to business strategy or tactics. Within our risk management framework, the functional responsibilities of risk management are divided into a tiered model, involving three lines of defense:
86
1.
The Finance Department to which primary market risk ownership belongs including monitoring and tracking of risk, model development and maintenance, and execution of strategy and tactics to mitigate market risk;
2.
The ERM Department which conducts independent risk and controls assessments to ensure appropriate risk identification, management, and reporting. The Model Risk Management group (“MRM”) within ERM is responsible for independent oversight of models used to measure market risk, including model and assumption implementation, development, and conceptual soundness; and
3.
The Internal Audit Department which independently assesses the operating effectiveness of the first- and second-line processes and controls.
Comments on Recent Developments.
 During the past several years, the U.S. economy has experienced both sharp increases and decreases in interest rates. As noted in the earlier section titled 
“Outlook and Trends”
 within this Item 7, beginning in March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) voted to increase the federal funds rate multiple times from a range of 0.00% to 0.25% to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% on July 26, 2023. The FOMC next adjusted the federal funds rate on September 18, 2024, when the FOMC reduced the target range by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% and again on November 7, 2024, when the FOMC reduced the target range further by 25 basis points to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%. Our market risk management framework is designed for the potential for such rapid changes in interest rates, by establishing policy limits on such rapid shocks and periodically back-testing modeled to actual results. Back-testing of top-line results as well as key assumptions is performed against established thresholds as part of our ongoing monitoring governance of our models, and results are reported to ALCO and MRM. Should back-testing results exceed established performance thresholds, the model and underlying assumptions will be reviewed for recalibration.
Net Interest Income Analysis.
 We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income (“NII”) model. We model our NII over a 12-month and 24-month period assuming no changes in interest rates and a static balance sheet, where cash flows from financial assets and liabilities are replaced with new business of similar terms at current rates. The impact of our interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments are included in the model results. We then model NII for the same period under the assumption that market rates increase and decrease instantaneously by certain basis point increments, which vary by period depending upon market conditions, with changes in interest rates representing immediate, permanent, and parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the “Changes in Interest Rates” column in the table below. 
Many assumptions are made in the modeling process for both NII and economic value of equity (“EVE”, discussed further below), including but not limited to the repricing and maturity characteristics of existing and new business, loan and security prepayments, administered deposit rate betas, duration of deposits without stated maturity dates, and other option risks. Management believes these assumptions to be reasonable for the various interest rate environments modeled. However, differences in actual results from these assumptions could change our exposure to interest rate risk. The models assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Additionally, the model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates. We do not model negative interest rate scenarios.
Because of the limitations inherent in any modeling approach used to measure market risk, including NII and EVE sensitivity analysis, and because, in the event of changes in interest rates, management would take active steps to manage interest rate risk exposure among its financial assets and liabilities, modeling results, including those discussed in “Interest Rate Sensitivity” and “EVE Interest Rate Sensitivity” below, should not be relied upon as a forecast of actual NII or EVE, nor should they be interpreted as management’s expectations of actual results in the event of such interest rate fluctuations. The tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, and actual results may differ.
87
The tables below set forth, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the modeled changes in our net interest income on an FTE basis that would result from the designated immediate changes in market interest rates:

Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
As of December 31, 2024, our model, as indicated above, shows a decline in our net interest income in rising rate scenarios. In the rising rate scenarios, funding costs are modeled to rise faster than income on earning assets, due, in part, to the mix of funding which has shifted towards higher rate paying deposits, which are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. As shown in the table above, the model generated similar results as of December 31, 2023. That is, the model showed a decline in our net interest income in the rising rate scenarios as funding costs were modeled to rise faster than income on earning assets, due, in part, to the shift in our mix of funding. The simulation results are within policy limits and management therefore does not expect a material change to our current strategy over the near term. The rate scenarios that we model at each period end are dependent upon market conditions, which is why the rate scenarios that we model may differ from period-to-period.
Management may use techniques such as investment strategy, loan and deposit pricing, non-core funding strategies, and interest rate derivative financial instruments, within internal policy guidelines, to manage interest rate risk as part of our asset/liability strategy. Hedging strategies such as, for example, receive-fixed and pay-fixed swaps, interest rate caps, floors, or collars, may be used to protect against benchmark interest rates either rising or falling. The type of derivatives we primarily use to hedge market risk are interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedging instruments. When the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March of 2022 from very low levels, management began evaluating a derivative strategy designed to limit our exposure to downward rate scenarios. In 2022, management executed a total of $2.4 billion in notional value of receive-fixed interest rate swap agreements on floating-rate loans. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and management believes these derivatives provide significant protection against falling interest rates, as they have the effect of converting floating rate loan exposure to fixed rates. These receive-fixed swaps constitute the entirety of our current hedge portfolio. Management may, from time to time, due to actual or projected changes in market rates or our risk exposure, evaluate other hedging strategies, although we believe our current Net Interest Income and Economic Value of Equity simulation analyses support maintaining the current derivatives strategy. For additional information related to our interest rate derivative financial instruments, see 
Note 18, “Derivative Financial Instruments”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Economic Value of Equity Analysis.
 We also analyze the sensitivity of our financial condition to changes in interest rates through our EVE model. This analysis calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities assuming various changes in current interest rates.
The tables below represent an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in our EVE, resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in the yield curve (+100, +200, +400 basis points and -100, -200, and -400 basis points) at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates.
Our earnings are not directly or materially impacted by movements in foreign currency rates or commodity prices. Movements in equity prices may have a modest impact on earnings by affecting the volume of activity or the amount of fees from investment-related business lines and by affecting the amount of unrealized gains and losses from securities held in rabbi trusts, the latter of which are partially offset by a corresponding but opposite impact to the amount of employee benefit expense associated with the change in value of plan assets.

Liquidity, Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies
Liquidity.
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet deposit withdrawals and anticipated loan fundings, as well as current and planned expenditures. We seek to maintain sources of liquidity that are reliable and diversified and that may be used during the normal course of business as well as on a contingency basis.
Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from calls, maturities and sales of securities, subject to market conditions. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan and securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are unencumbered cash and cash equivalents and securities classified as available for sale, which could be liquidated, subject to market conditions. In the future, 
89
our liquidity position will continue to be affected by the level of customer deposits and payments, loan originations and repayments, as well as any acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases in which we may engage. For the next twelve months, we believe that our existing resources, including our capacity to use brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings, will be sufficient to meet the liquidity and capital requirements of our operations. We may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt financing to fund business activities such as strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, or other purposes beyond the next twelve months.
We participate in the IntraFi Network, which allows us to provide access to FDIC deposit insurance protection on customer deposits for consumers, businesses and public entities that exceed same-bank FDIC insurance thresholds. We can elect to sell or repurchase this funding as reciprocal deposits from other IntraFi Network banks depending on our funding needs. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no IntraFi Network one-way sell deposits. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had repurchased $2.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of previously sold reciprocal deposits.
Although customer deposits remain our preferred source of funds, maintaining additional sources of liquidity is part of our prudent liquidity risk management practices. We have the ability to borrow from the FHLBB. At December 31, 2024, we had $17.6 million in outstanding advances and the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.4 billion. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. At December 31, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to $2.8 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Discount Window. At December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $1.0 billion and secured borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank totaled $5.2 billion, providing total liquidity sources of $6.2 billion. These liquidity sources provided 90% coverage of all customer uninsured and uncollateralized deposits, which totaled $6.9 billion, or 32% of total deposits, as of December 31, 2024. For further discussion of uninsured deposits, refer to the

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, loans with a carrying value of $2.3 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, and securities with a carrying value of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 were pledged to the FHLBB resulting in this additional unused borrowing capacity. No securities were pledged to the FHLBB as collateral as of December 31, 2023.
(3)
Securities with a carrying value of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2023 were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under the Bank Term Funding Program, resulting in this additional unused borrowing capacity. The Bank Term Funding Program ceased extending new loans March 11, 2024. Accordingly, we had no additional capacity nor any securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston under the Bank Term Funding Program as of December 31, 2024.
(4)
Loans with a carrying value of $3.1 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and securities with a carrying value of $794.8 million and $168.8 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were pledged to the Discount Window, resulting in this additional borrowing capacity. The increase in the amount of securities pledged to the Discount Window at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was due to additional securities pledged which were previously pledged as collateral to the Bank Term Funding Program.
We believe that advanced preparation, early detection, and prompt responses can avoid, minimize, or shorten potential liquidity constraints. Our Board of Directors and management’s ALCO oversee the assessment and monitoring of risk levels, as well as potential responses during unanticipated stress events. As part of our risk management framework, we perform periodic liquidity stress testing to assess our need for liquid assets as well as backup sources of liquidity.
Capital Resources.
 We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve (with respect to our consolidated capital requirements). At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and were considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. For additional information regarding our regulatory capital requirements, refer to 
Note

14, “Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements”
 within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies.
 In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. The amounts below assume the contractual obligations and commitments will run through the end of the applicable term and, as such, do not include early termination fees or penalties where applicable.
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. The financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit, unadvanced portions of construction loans and standby letters of credit, all of which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The following table summarizes our short-term (e.g. maturity of one year or less) and long-term (e.g. maturity of greater than one year) contractual obligations, other commitments and contingencies at December 31, 2024.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eastern Bankshares, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eastern Bankshares, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Allowance for loan losses
Description of the Matter
The Company’s loan portfolio totaled $18.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, management established an allowance for loan losses of $229 million. As described in Note 2 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses its allowance methodology to systematically estimate the amount of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio. Expected lifetime losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics and are determined using a quantitative model based on management’s determination of a loan’s probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default, which are derived from the Company’s historical losses, industry loss experience and other factors, adjusted for economic forecasts. The quantitative model is combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. Additionally, the Company estimates an allowance for loan losses on an individual basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, based on discounted cash flows or fair value of collateral.
Auditing the Company’s allowance for loan losses was complex due to the quantitative modeling used, the subjective judgment involved to evaluate management’s assessment of qualitative factors in determining adjustments to the quantitative model output, and the subjective judgment involved to evaluate management’s individual allowance assessments.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s allowance for loan losses process, which included, among others, controls over the appropriateness of the methodology, the development, operation and monitoring of the quantitative model, management’s review of the qualitative adjustments to the quantitative model output and overall model result, and individual allowance assessments.
We tested management’s quantitative model including, among other procedures, evaluating the model validation procedures performed over conceptual soundness of model methodology, and with the assistance EY Specialists, we tested management’s quantitative model including an evaluation of the model validation procedures performed over conceptual soundness of model methodology, assessed model governance policies and procedures, and assessed the conceptual soundness of the Company’s qualitative factor framework utilized in determining the overall allowance for loan losses.
To test the qualitative risk factors, among other procedures, we assessed management’s methodology and considered whether relevant risks were reflected in the models and whether adjustments to the model output were appropriate. We tested the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying data used to estimate the qualitative adjustments. We evaluated whether qualitative adjustments were reasonable based on changes in key model data, market conditions, the credit quality and composition of the loan portfolio, and the economic forecast. We tested whether management’s final qualitative factor weighting was consistent with the external and internal evidence obtained. We performed an independent test over the existence of potential new or contrary information relating to risks impacting the qualitative adjustments to validate that management’s considerations were appropriate. Additionally, we performed an analysis examining quarter-over-quarter changes to the Company’s qualitative factor adjustments to test reasonableness and timing of changes to the Company’s qualitative factors. 
To test the allowance on loans individually assessed for impairment among other procedures, on a sample basis we assessed credit risk-rating assignments, evaluated the fair value of collateral, and involved EY specialists to evaluate assumptions and fair value of certain collateral.

Fair Value of Acquired Loans and Core Deposit Intangible Recognized as Part of the Cambridge Bancorp, Inc. Merger
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Cambridge Bancorp, Inc. (Cambridge) on July 12, 2024. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination and accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Cambridge were recorded at fair value as of the merger date. The fair value of loans acquired from Cambridge was approximately $3.65 billion as of July 12, 2024. As disclosed by the Company, the fair value of acquired loans was determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, as adjusted for an estimate of future credit losses and prepayments, and then applying a market-based discount rate to those cash flows. Additionally, the Company recognized a core deposit intangible asset of approximately $115 million as of July 12, 2024. The fair value of the core deposit intangible asset was determined based on projected cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with market participants.
Auditing the Company’s estimates of the fair value of acquired loans and core deposit intangible asset was complex due to the judgment required by management in determining the discount rates and prepayment rates used in the discounted cash flow methodology for the fair value of acquired loans and the discount rate, projected deposit attrition rates, deposit account servicing costs, and the cost of alternate funding sources assumptions for the fair value of the core deposit intangible asset. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the judgments made by management, and required the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process for estimating the acquired loans and core deposit intangible asset fair values, including management’s controls over completeness and accuracy of key inputs and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology, including loan and deposit data.
To test the estimated fair value of acquired loans, our audit procedures included, among others, involving EY specialists to assist us in testing management’s methodology and significant assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the acquired loan portfolio. We involved our specialists to test, on a sample basis, the determination and application of discount rates and prepayment rates by comparing management’s selected assumptions to independently developed ranges based on third party market data. We tested, on a sample basis, completeness and accuracy of the underlying loan data provided by management that was used in the fair value calculation. On a sample basis, we performed independent comparative calculations of the fair value adjustment to the acquired loans.
To test the estimated fair value of the core deposit intangible asset, our audit procedures included, among others, involving EY specialists to assist us in testing management’s methodology and significant assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the core deposit intangible. We involved our specialists to test the determination and application of discount rate, projected deposit attrition rates, deposit account servicing costs, and cost of alternate funding sources assumptions by comparing management’s selected assumptions to independently developed ranges based on third party market data. Additionally, we tested completeness and accuracy of the underlying deposit data provided by management that was used in the fair value calculation. Lastly, we performed an independent comparative calculation of the core deposit intangible asset fair value.

EASTERN BANKSHARES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Corporate Structure and Nature of Operations; Basis of Presentation
Corporate Structure and Nature of Operations
Eastern Bankshares, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the “Company”), is a bank holding company. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eastern Bank (the “Bank”), the Company provides a variety of banking services and trust and investment services, through its full-service bank branches, located primarily in eastern Massachusetts, and southern and coastal New Hampshire.
Eastern Insurance Group was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. On September 19, 2023, the Company and the Bank entered into an asset purchase agreement in which Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (“Gallagher”) agreed to purchase substantially all of Eastern Insurance Group’s assets for cash consideration and to assume certain liabilities. On October 31, 2023, the Company completed its sale of its insurance agency business to Gallagher. Refer to 
Note 23, “Discontinued Operations”
 for further discussion regarding discontinued operations.
The activities of the Company are subject to the regulatory supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). The activities of the Bank are subject to the regulatory supervision of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The Company and the activities of the Bank and its subsidiaries are also subject to various Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island business, banking and trust-related regulations.
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and its Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) as well as the rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities laws.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities in which it holds a controlling financial interest through being the primary beneficiary or through holding a majority of the voting interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and income and expenses for the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates based on changing conditions, including economic conditions and future events. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, valuation and fair value measurements, allowance for credit losses on investment securities, the liabilities for benefit obligations (particularly pensions), the provision for income taxes and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold, and other short-term investments including restricted cash pledged, all of which have an original maturity of 90 days or less.
 Cash and cash equivalents includes $
30.0
 million and $
11.5
 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which for purposes of the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, is included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
Securities
Debt securities are classified at the time of purchase as either “trading,” “available for sale” (“AFS”) or “held to maturity” (“HTM”). Equity securities are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of resale in the near term are classified as trading securities 
102
and recorded at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value included in net income. Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTM securities and recorded at amortized cost. 
Debt securities not classified as either trading or HTM are classified as AFS and recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value excluded from net income and reported in other comprehensive income, net of related tax. Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are computed using the effective interest rate method.
ASU 2016-13 made targeted changes to ASC 320 to eliminate the concept of “other than temporary” from the impairment loss estimation model for AFS securities. A summary of the changes made by the Company to the existing impairment model (previously referred to as the “OTTI” model) as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-13 is as follows:
•
The use of an allowance approach, rather than a permanent write-down of a security’s cost basis upon determination of an impairment loss.
•
The amount of the allowance is limited to the amount at which the security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis.
•
The Company may not consider the length of time a security’s fair value has been less than amortized cost.
•
The Company may not consider recoveries in fair value after the balance sheet date when assessing whether a credit loss exists.
The Company’s AFS securities are carried at fair value. For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, management will first evaluate whether there is intent to sell a security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the Company will record a write-down of the security’s amortized cost basis to fair value through income. For those AFS securities which do not meet the intent or requirement to sell criteria, management will evaluate whether the decline in fair value is a result of credit related matters or other factors. In performing this assessment, management considers the creditworthiness of the issuer including whether the security is guaranteed by the U.S. federal government or other government agency, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes in credit rating during the period, among other factors. If this assessment indicates the existence of credit losses, an allowance for credit losses will be established, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis. To the extent the estimated cash flows do not support the amortized cost, the deficiency is considered to be due to credit loss and is recognized in earnings.
Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when the security is determined to be uncollectible, or when either of the aforementioned criteria surrounding intent or requirement to sell have been met. On January 1, 2022, the date on which the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, 
no
 allowance for credit losses was recorded for AFS securities.
Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized at the time of sale on the specific-identification basis.

Refer to 
Note 4, “Securities”
 for additional information regarding the measurement of impairment losses on AFS securities.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Held to Maturity Securities
The Company measures expected credit losses on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type which, as of December 31, 2024, included government-sponsored residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Securities in the Company’s HTM portfolio are guaranteed by either the U.S. federal government or other government sponsored agencies with a long history of no credit losses. As a result, management has determined that these securities have a zero loss expectation and therefore does not record an allowance for credit losses on these securities. Refer to 
Note 4, “Securities”
 for additional information regarding the measurement of credit losses on HTM securities.
Loans
Loans are reported at their principal amount outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs and any unearned discount or unamortized premium for acquired loans. Unearned discount and unamortized premium are accreted and amortized, respectively, to interest and dividend income on a basis that results in level rates of return over the terms of the loans. For originated loans, origination fees and related direct incremental origination costs are offset, and the resulting net amount is deferred and amortized over the life of the related loans using the effective interest method, assuming a certain level of prepayments. When loans are sold or repaid, the unamortized fees and costs are recorded to interest and dividend income. Interest income on loans is accrued based upon the daily principal amount outstanding except for loans on non-accrual status. For acquired loans, interest income is also accrued based upon the daily principal amount outstanding and is adjusted further by the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium associated with the loan.

103
Non-performing Loans (“NPLs”)
Non-accrual Loans
Interest accruals are generally discontinued when management has determined that the borrower may be unable to meet contractual obligations and/or when loans are 90 days or more past due. Exceptions may be made if management believes that collateral held by the Company is clearly sufficient and in full satisfaction of both principal and interest. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period income and amortization of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premiums and unearned discounts is discontinued. Interest received on non-accrual loans is either applied against principal or reported as income according to management’s judgment as to the collectability of principal. Non-accrual loans may be returned to an accrual status when principal and interest payments are no longer delinquent, and the risk characteristics of the loan have improved to the extent that there no longer exists a concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Loans are considered past due based upon the number of days delinquent according to their contractual terms. Non-accrual loans and loans that are more than 90 days past due but still accruing interest are considered NPLs.

Loans Individually Assessed for Impairment
ASC 326 indicates that a loan should be measured for impairment individually if that loan shares no similar risk characteristics with other loans. For the Company, loans which have been identified as those to be individually assessed for impairment under CECL include loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans in the corresponding reserve segment. Characteristics of loans meeting this definition may include, but are not limited to:
•
Loans determined to be collateral dependent as defined below;
•
Loans on non-accrual status;
•
Loans with a risk rating of 12 under the Company’s risk rating scale, substandard (well-defined weakness) or worse;
•
Loans to borrowers actively involved in bankruptcy proceedings; and
•
Loans that have been partially charged-off.
Collateral-Dependent Loans
Management considers a loan to be collateral-dependent when foreclosure of the underlying collateral is probable. In addition, in accordance with ASC 326, the Company elected to apply the collateral-dependent practical expedient whereby the Company measures expected credit losses using the fair value of the collateral, less any estimated costs to sell, when foreclosure is not probable but repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.
Modifications of Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, 
Receivables—Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors
, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Thus, as a result of adoption of this standard on January 1, 2023, rather than applying the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, the Company now applies the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance codified in paragraphs 310-20-35-9 through 35-11 of the Accounting Standards Codification to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. 
Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty include principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays and combinations thereof. Expected losses or recoveries related to loans where modifications have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty have been included in the Company’s determination of the allowance for loan losses. Upon adoption of ASU 2022-02, the Company is no longer required to use a discounted cash flow method to measure the allowance for loan losses resulting from a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Accordingly, the Company now applies the same credit methodology it uses for similar loans that were not modified. The Company adopted ASU 2022-02 using the modified retrospective transition method. Accordingly, upon adoption, commercial loan TDRs existing at that time which were measured using a discounted cash flow methodology and all residential real estate and consumer home equity loan TDRs were transitioned to the applicable segment of loans collectively evaluated for impairment based upon their risk characteristics. Those commercial loans that were determined to be TDRs under previously effective accounting guidance, and which were determined to be collateral dependent, continue to be assessed for impairment on an individual basis.
104
Prior to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2022-02, in cases where a borrower was experiencing financial difficulties and the Company made certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan was classified as a TDR. Modifications included adjustments to interest rates, extensions of maturity, consumer loans where the borrower’s obligations had been effectively discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the borrower had not reaffirmed the debt to the Company, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Management identified loans as TDR loans when it had a reasonable expectation that it would execute a TDR modification with a borrower. In addition, management estimated expected credit losses on a collective basis if a group of TDR loans shared similar risk characteristics. If a TDR loan’s risk characteristics were not similar to those of any of the Company’s other TDR loans, expected credit losses on the TDR loan were measured individually. The impairment analysis discounted the present value of the anticipated cash flows by the loan’s contractual rate of interest in effect prior to the loan’s modification or the fair value of collateral if the loan was collateral dependent. The amount of credit loss, if any, was recorded as a specific loss allocation to each individual loan or as a loss allocation to the pool of loans, for those loans for which credit loss was measured on a collective basis, in the allowance for credit losses. Any commercial (commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction, and business banking loans) or residential loan that had been classified as a TDR and which subsequently defaulted was reviewed to determine if the loan should be deemed collateral-dependent. In such an instance, any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the book value of the loan was determined by measuring the recorded investment in the loan against the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.
Refer to 
Note 5, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”
 for additional information regarding the Company’s measurement of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and information regarding the Company’s TDR loans for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Loans
The Company applied the prospective transition approach with respect to PCD assets upon adoption of ASU 2016-13. Under this approach, loans previously determined to be PCI loans are considered to be PCD loans as of January 1, 2022. PCD loans are acquired individual loans (or acquired groups of loans with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company’s assessment. A PCD loan is recorded at its purchase price plus the allowance for loan losses expected at the time of acquisition, or “gross up” of the amortized cost basis, if any. Changes in the current estimate of the allowance for loan losses subsequent to acquisition from the estimated allowance previously recorded are recognized in the income statement as provision for credit losses or reversal of provision for credit losses in subsequent periods as they arise. A purchased loan that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to the Company’s method of accounting for originated assets, whereby an allowance for loan losses is recognized with a corresponding increase to the income statement provision for loan losses. Evidence that purchased loans, measured at amortized cost, have more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination and, therefore meet the PCD definition, may include past-due status, non-accrual status, risk rating and other standard indicators (i.e., modification due to financial difficulty, charge-offs, bankruptcy).
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, or “ACL,” is established to provide for the Company’s current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost and unfunded lending commitments at the balance sheet date and is established through a provision for credit losses charged to net income. Credit losses are charged directly to the ACL. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL. Commercial and residential loans are charged-off in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Delinquent loans in these product types are subject to ongoing review and analysis to determine if a charge-off in the current period is appropriate. For consumer finance loans, policies and procedures exist that require charge-off consideration upon a certain triggering event depending on the product type. Charge-off triggers include: 120 days delinquent for automobile, home equity, and other consumer loans with the exception of cash reserve loans for which the trigger is 150 days delinquent; death of the borrower; or Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In addition to those events, the charge-off determination includes other loan quality indicators, such as collateral position and adequacy or the presence of other repayment sources. 
The ACL is evaluated on a regular basis by management. Management uses a methodology to systematically estimate the amount of expected lifetime losses in the portfolio. Expected lifetime losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics and are determined using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. For the commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction and business banking portfolios, the quantitative model uses a loan rating system which is comprised of management’s determination of a financial asset’s probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) and exposure at default (“EAD”), which are derived from both the Company’s and industry historical loss experience and other factors. For residential real estate, consumer home equity and other consumer portfolios, the Company’s quantitative model uses historical loss experience. 
105
The quantitative model estimates expected credit losses using loan level data over the estimated life of the exposure, considering the effect of prepayments. Economic forecasts are incorporated into the estimate over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, beyond which is a reversion to the Company’s and/or industry historical loss average. Management has determined that a reasonable and supportable forecast period of eight quarters, and a straight-line reversion period of four quarters, are appropriate forecast periods for purposes of estimating expected credit losses. As described above, quantitative model results are adjusted for risk factors not considered within the model but which are relevant in estimating the expected credit losses within the loan portfolio. The qualitative risk factors impacting the expected risk of loss within the loan portfolio include the following:
•
Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices;
•
Nature and volume of the portfolio;
•
Volume and severity of past-due, non-accrual and classified loans;
•
The value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent;
•
Concentrations of credit risk;
•
Model and data limitations; and
•
Other external factors, such as changes in legal, regulatory or competitive environments.
Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual evaluation and are removed from the collectively assessed pools. For loans that are individually evaluated, the Company uses either a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) approach or, for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure is probable, a fair value of collateral approach. 
Accrued interest receivable amounts are excluded from balances of loans held at amortized cost and are included within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Management has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses on these amounts as the Company employs a timely write-off policy. Consistent with the Company's policy for non-accrual loans, accrued interest receivable is typically written off when loans reach 90 days past due and are placed on non-accrual status.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become payable. The credit risk associated with these commitments is evaluated in a manner similar to the reserving method for loans receivable previously described. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the Company’s examination process, periodically assess the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses and may require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, in accordance with GAAP.
Refer to 
Note 5, “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”
 for additional information regarding the Company’s measurement of credit losses on loans receivable and off-balance sheet commitments to lend as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and comparative loan modification information for which ASC 310, 
“Receivables”
 was applied (i.e., prior to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2022-02) for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Mortgage Banking Activities
Mortgage loans held for sale to the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value on an individual loan basis. The Company enters into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans with an offsetting forward commitment to sell them in the secondary markets in order to mitigate interest rate risk. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income at the time of sale. Interest income is recognized on loans held for sale between the time the loan is funded and the loan is sold. Direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred upon origination and are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on the date of sale.

Other Real Estate Owned 
OREO consists of properties and other assets acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is recorded in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, on an individual asset basis at the fair value less estimated costs to sell on the date control is obtained. Any write-downs to the cost of the related asset upon transfer to OREO to reflect the asset at fair value less estimated costs to sell is recorded through the allowance for loan losses. The Company relies primarily on third-party valuation information from certified appraisers and values are generally based upon recent appraisals of the underlying collateral, brokers’ opinions based upon recent sales of comparable properties, estimated 
106
equipment auction or liquidation values, income capitalization, or a combination of income capitalization and comparable sales.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held 
no
 OREO. 
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock
The Company, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Boston (“FHLBB”), is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of the FHLB. Based on redemption provisions, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost.

Premises and Equipment
Land is carried at cost. Buildings, leasehold improvements and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated lives of the improvements. Expected lease terms include lease options to the extent that the exercise of such options is reasonably assured. 
Banking premises and equipment held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the net assets of the companies acquired are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent acquired assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights, or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own, or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. 
The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of November 30, or more often if warranted, using a quantitative impairment approach. Previously, the Company’s annual evaluation of its goodwill for impairment was performed on September 30 of each year. Refer to 
Note 8, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” 
for additional discussion of the change in impairment assessment date. The quantitative impairment test compares the book value to the fair value of each reporting unit. If the book value exceeds the fair value, an impairment is charged to net income. Management has identified 
one
 reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment which is referred to as “the banking business.”
Other intangible assets, all of which are definite-lived, are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The Company evaluates other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recovered. The Company considers factors including, but not limited to, changes in legal factors and business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset. Any impairment losses are charged to net income. The Company amortizes other intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of core deposit identifiable intangible assets fall within a range of 
five
 to 
seven years
 and the estimated useful lives of the customer list and trade name intangible assets from the Cambridge Bancorp (“Cambridge”) merger are 
eleven
 and 
five years
, respectively. The Company reassesses the useful lives of other intangible assets at least annually, or more frequently based on specific events or changes in circumstances.

Retirement Plans
The Company provides benefits to its employees and executive officers through various retirement plans, including a defined benefit plan, a defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan, a defined contribution plan, a benefit equalization plan, and an outside directors’ retainer continuance plan. 
The Company provides pension benefits for its employees using a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit plan, through membership in the Savings Banks Employees Retirement Association (“SBERA”). The Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan (“Defined Benefit Plan”) is a noncontributory, defined benefit plan. The Company’s employees become eligible after attaining age 
21
 and completing 
one year
 of service. Effective November 1, 2020, the Defined Benefit Plan, sponsored by the Company, was amended to convert the plan from a traditional final average earnings plan design to a cash balance plan design. 
Under the final average earnings plan design, benefits became fully vested after 
three years
 of eligible service for individuals employed on or before October 31, 1989. For individuals employed subsequent to October 31, 1989 and who were already in the Defined Benefit Plan as of November 1, 2020, benefits became fully vested after 
five years
 of eligible service. 
Under the cash balance plan design, hypothetical account balances are established for each participant and pension benefits are generally stated as the lump sum amount in that hypothetical account. Contribution credits equal to a percentage of 
107
a participant’s annual compensation (if the participant works at least 
1,000
 hours during the year) and interest credits equal to the greater of the 
30-Year
 Treasury rate for September preceding the current plan year or 
3.5
% are added to a participant’s account each year. For employees hired prior to November 1, 2020, annual contribution credits generally increase as the participant remains employed with the Company. Employees hired on and after November 1, 2020 receive annual contribution credits equal to 
5
% of annual compensation, with no future increases. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, since a cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan, the annual retirement benefit payable at normal retirement (age 
65
) is an annuity, which is the actuarial equivalent of the participant’s account balance under the cash balance plan design, plus their frozen benefit under the final average earnings plan design. However, under the Defined Benefit Plan, participants may elect, with the consent of their spouses if they are married, to have the benefits distributed as a lump sum rather than an annuity. The lump sum is equal to the sum of the actuarial equivalent of their frozen benefit under the final average earnings plan design, plus their cash balance account. Under the Company’s non-Qualified Benefit Equalization Plan (“BEP”), which is described further below, benefits are generally only payable as a lump sum, which is equal to the sum of the actuarial equivalent of their frozen benefit under the final average earnings plan design, plus their cash balance account. The Company’s annual contribution to the plan is based upon standards established by the Pension Protection Act. The contribution is based on an actuarial method intended to provide not only for benefits attributable to service to date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future.
The Company also has an unfunded Defined Benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“DB SERP”) that provides certain retired officers with defined pension benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by U.S. federal tax law. The DB SERP has a plan year end of December 31. 
The Company’s BEP, which is an unfunded plan, provides retirement benefits to certain employees whose retirement benefits under the Defined Benefit Plan are limited per the Internal Revenue Code. The BEP has a plan year end of October 31. Effective November 1, 2020, the BEP, sponsored by the Company, was amended to convert the plan from a traditional final average earnings plan design to a cash balance plan design.
The Company also has an unfunded Outside Directors’ Retainer Continuance Plan (“ODRCP”) that provides pension benefits to outside directors who retire from service. The Outside Directors’ Retainer Continuance Plan has a plan year end of December 31. Effective December 31, 2020, the Company closed the ODRCP to new participants and froze benefit accruals for active participants.
In connection with the Company’s merger with Cambridge, the Company acquired Cambridge’s post-retirement health care plan. Benefits for the postretirement health care plan are based on years of service. Expenses for the postretirement health care plan are recognized over the employee's service life utilizing the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. Effective November 7, 2019, the postretirement health care plan was frozen for employees hired after that date. The frozen health care plan is not accruing and is only in payout status.
Defined Benefit Plan assets are invested in various investment funds and held at fair value which generally represents observable market prices. Pension liability is determined based on the actuarial cost method factoring in assumptions such as salary increases, expected retirement date, mortality rate, and employee turnover. The actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expense is the traditional unit credit method. The projected benefit obligation is principally determined based on the present value of the projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate (which is the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date). The discount rate which is utilized is determined using the spot rate approach whereby the individual spot rates on the Financial Times and Stock Exchange (“FTSE”) above-median yield curve are applied to each corresponding year’s projected cash flow used to measure the respective plan’s service cost and interest cost. Periodic pension expense (or income) includes service costs, interest costs based on the assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, if applicable, based on the market value of assets and amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Net periodic benefit cost excluding service cost is included within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Service cost for all plans is included in salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amortization of actuarial gains and losses for the DB SERP and ODRCP is determined using the 10% corridor minimum amortization approach and is taken over the average remaining future service of the plan participants for the ODRCP, and over the average remaining future life expectancy of plan participants for the DB SERP. The amortization of actuarial gains and losses for the Defined Benefit Plan is determined without using the 10% corridor minimum amortization approach and is taken over the average remaining future service of the plan participants. The overfunded or underfunded status of the plans is recorded as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in that status recognized through other comprehensive income, net of related taxes. Funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the market value of the plan’s assets.
Employee Tax Deferred Incentive Plan
The Company has an employee tax deferred incentive plan (“401(k) plan”) under which the Company makes voluntary contributions within certain limitations. All employees who meet specified age and length of service requirements are 
108
eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan. The amount contributed by the Company is included in salaries and employee benefits expense. 
Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
The Company has a defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan (“DC SERP”), which allows certain senior officers to earn benefits calculated as a percentage of their compensation. The participant benefits are adjusted based upon a deemed investment performance of measurement funds selected by the participant. These measurement funds are for tracking purposes and are used only to track the performance of a mutual fund, market index, savings instrument, or other designated investment or portfolio of investments. Effective December 31, 2021, the Company closed the DC SERP to new participants and froze benefit accruals for active participants. The total amount due to participants under this plan is included in other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Deferred Compensation
The Company sponsors 
four
 plans which allow for elective compensation deferrals by directors, former trustees, and certain senior-level employees. Each plan allows its participants to designate deemed investments for deferred amounts from certain options which include diversified choices, such as exchange traded funds and mutual funds. Portfolios with various risk profiles are available to participants with the approval of the Compensation Committee. The Company purchases and sells investments which track the deemed investment choices, so that it has available funds to meet its payment liabilities. Deferred amounts, adjusted for deemed investment performance, are paid at the time of a participant designated date or event, such as separation from service, death, or disability. The total amounts due to participants under these plans are included in other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”)
Unallocated ESOP shares are shown as a reduction of equity and are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity as unallocated common stock held by ESOP. Compensation expense for the Company’s ESOP is recorded at an amount equal to the shares committed to be allocated by the ESOP multiplied by the average fair market value of the shares during the year. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the year based upon the Company’s estimate of the number of shares committed to be allocated by the ESOP. When the shares are committed to be released, unallocated common stock held by ESOP is reduced by the cost of the ESOP shares released and the difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares committed to be allocated by the ESOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The Company’s ESOP is classified as an internally leveraged plan as defined by ASC 718, 
“Compensation-Stock Compensation.”
 Accordingly, the loan receivable from the ESOP is not reported as an asset nor is the Company’s guarantee to fund the ESOP reported as a liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures share-based compensation on the grant date fair value on a straight-line basis over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award; the requisite service period. The Company uses various pricing models to estimate the fair value of stock awards granted. The Company measures the fair value of the restricted stock using the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company records compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the Company’s restricted stock with a corresponding increase in equity. Reductions in compensation expense associated with forfeited awards are accounted for as incurred. Upon vesting, the tax effect of the difference between the fair value of the award and the recorded expense is recognized as a component of income tax expense. Refer to 
Note 16, “Share-Based Compensation”
 for additional information regarding the Company’s share-based compensation plan.
Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”) and Voting Interest Entities (“VOE”) 
The Company is involved in the normal course of business with various types of special purpose entities, some of which meet the definition for VIEs and VOEs. 
VIEs are entities that possess any of the following characteristics: 1) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; 2) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack any of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest; or 3) the equity investors’ voting rights are not proportional to the economics, and substantially all of the activities of the entity either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. The Company consolidates entities deemed to be VIEs when it, or a wholly-owned subsidiary, is determined to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis is a qualitative analysis based on power and economics. An enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a VIE if it has both 1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s 
109
economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE. 
VOEs are entities in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities. The Company generally consolidates VOEs when it, or a wholly-owned subsidiary, holds the majority of the voting interest in the VOE. 
Rabbi Trusts
The Company established rabbi trusts to meet its obligations under certain executive non-qualified retirement benefits and deferred compensation plans and to mitigate the expense volatility of the aforementioned retirement plans. The rabbi trusts are considered VIEs as the equity investment at risk is insufficient to permit the trust to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from the Company. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trusts as it has the power to direct the activities of the rabbi trusts that significantly affect the rabbi trust’s economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the rabbi trusts that could potentially be significant to the rabbi trusts by virtue of its contingent call options on the rabbi trust’s assets in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy. As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Company consolidates the rabbi trust investments. In general, the rabbi trust investments and any earnings received thereon are accumulated, reinvested and used exclusively for trust purposes. These rabbi trust investments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government agency obligations, equity securities, mutual funds and other exchange-traded funds, and are recorded at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value are recorded in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These rabbi trust assets are included within other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Bank Owned Life Insurance 
The Company holds bank-owned life insurance on the lives of certain participating executives, primarily as a result of mergers and acquisitions. The amount reported as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is the sum of the cash surrender values reported to the Company by the various insurance carriers. Certain policies are split-dollar life insurance policies whereby the Company recognizes a liability for the postretirement benefit related to the arrangement. This postretirement benefit is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled. A valuation allowance is established if it is considered more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Interest and penalties paid on the underpayment of income taxes are classified as income tax expense. 
The Company periodically evaluates the potential uncertainty of its tax positions as to whether it is more-likely than-not its position would be upheld upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.

Low Income Housing Tax Credits and Other Tax Credit Investments
As part of its community reinvestment initiatives, the Company primarily invests in qualified affordable housing projects in addition to other tax credit investment projects. The Company receives low-income housing tax credits, investment tax credits, rehabilitation tax credits, solar tax credits and other tax credits as a result of its investments in these limited partnership investments. 
The Company accounts for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method and amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits allocated to the Company. The amortization of the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated residual value is included as a component of income tax expense. At investment inception, the Company records a liability for the committed amount of the investment; this liability is reduced as contributions are made. 
The Company evaluates investments in tax credit investment companies for consolidation based on the variable or voting interest entity guidance, as appropriate. Other tax credit investment projects are accounted for using either the cost method or equity method.
110
Trust Operations 
The Bank is a full-service trust company that provides a wide range of trust services to customers that includes managing customer investments, safekeeping customer assets, supplying disbursement services, and providing other fiduciary services. Trust assets held in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as they are not assets of the Company. The fees charged are variable based on various factors such as the Company’s responsibility, the type of account, and account size. Customers are also charged a base fee which is prorated over a twelve-month period. Fees for additional or special services are generally fixed in nature and are charged as services are rendered. Revenue from administrative and management activities associated with these assets is recognized as performance obligations of underlying agreements are satisfied.
Derivative Financial Instruments 
Derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument is determined by whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, by the type of hedging relationship. At the inception of a hedge, the Company documents certain items, including, but not limited to, the following: the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, the Company’s risk management objectives, hedging strategies, and the evaluation of hedge transaction effectiveness. Documentation includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. 
The Company’s derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are classified as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction). As such, changes in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects net income. Such reclassifications are presented in the same income statement line item as the net income effect of the hedged item. If the hedging instrument is not highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the revised contractually specified interest rate(s), hedge accounting will be discontinued. At that time, accumulated other comprehensive income would be frozen and amortized, as long as the forecasted transactions are still probable of occurring. If a cash flow hedge is terminated, hedge accounting treatment would be retained, and accumulated other comprehensive income would be frozen and amortized, as long as the forecasted transactions are still probable of occurring.
The Company’s derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in other noninterest income. Derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments include interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts offered to commercial customers to assist them in meeting their financing and investing objectives for their risk management purposes, and risk participation agreements entered into as financial guarantees of performance on customer-related interest rate swap derivatives. The interest rate and foreign exchange risks associated with customer interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with correspondent bank counterparties. 
All derivative financial instruments eligible for clearing are cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”). In accordance with its amended rulebook, CME legally characterizes variation margin payments made to and received from the CME as settlement of derivatives rather than as collateral against derivatives.

Fair Value Measurements
ASC 820 “
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
” (“ASC 820”) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements), and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
111
Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions that are significant to the fair value measurement. 
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Leases
The Company leases certain office space and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases, some of which have renewal options to extend lease terms. At lease inception, the Company evaluates the lease terms to determine if the lease should be classified as an operating lease or a finance lease and recognizes a right of use (“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability. The Company makes the decision on whether to renew an option to extend a lease by considering various factors. The Company will recognize an adjustment to its ROU asset and lease liability when lease agreements are amended and executed. The discount rate used in determining the present value of lease payments is based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate for borrowings with terms similar to each lease at commencement date. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. The Company has elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.
Common Share Repurchases
Shares repurchased by the Company under the Company’s share repurchase programs have been classified as authorized but unissued shares. The cost of shares repurchased by the Company has been accounted for as a reduction to common stock and additional paid in capital balances. Massachusetts state law calls for repurchased shares to be classified as authorized but unissued shares. U.S. GAAP states that the accounting for share repurchases shall conform to state law where applicable.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share represents income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Unallocated ESOP shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations. ESOP shares committed to be released are considered to be outstanding for purposes of the earnings per share computation. ESOP shares that have not been legally released, but that relate to employee services rendered during an accounting period (interim or annual) ending before the related debt service payment is made, are considered committed to be released. Diluted earnings per share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate to outstanding stock awards and are determined using the treasury stock method.
Segment Reporting
An operating segment is defined as a component of a business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. The Company has determined that its CODM is its Executive Chair. The Company has 
one
 reportable segment: its banking business, which consists of a full range of banking lending, savings, and small business offerings, and its wealth management and trust operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Relevant standards that were recently issued but not yet adopted as of December 31, 2024:
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, 
Disclosure Improvements–Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative
 (“ASU 2023-06”)
.
 The amendments in this update modify the disclosure or presentation requirements for a variety of topics in the codification. Certain amendments represent 
112
clarifications to or technical corrections of the current requirements. The following is a summary of the topics included in the update and which pertain to the Company:
1.
Statement of cash flows (Topic 230): Requires an accounting policy disclosure in annual periods of where cash flows associated with derivative instruments and their related gains and loses are presented in the statement of cash flows;
2.
Accounting changes and error corrections (Topic 250): Requires that when there has been a change in the reporting entity, the entity disclose any material prior-period adjustment and the effect of the adjustment on retained earnings in interim financial statements;
3.
Earnings per share (Topic 260): Requires disclosure of the methods used in the diluted earnings-per-share computation for each dilutive security and clarifies that certain disclosures should be made during interim periods, and amends illustrative guidance to illustrate disclosure of the methods used in the diluted earnings per share computation;
4.
Commitments (Topic 440): Requires disclosure of assets mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise subject to lien and the obligations collateralized; and
5.
Debt (Topic 470): Requires disclosure of amounts and terms of unused lines of credit and unfunded commitments and the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding short-term borrowings.
For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2023-06 are effective on the date which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation and S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the codification and will not become effective for any entity. Early adoption is not permitted and the amendments are required to be applied on a prospective basis. The Company expects the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The amendments in this update are intended to improve income tax disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures related to the existing requirements to disclose a rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and certain other required disclosures. Specifically, the amendments in this update:
1.
Require that a public entity disclose, on an annual basis: (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The update requires disclosure of such reconciling items according to requirements indicated in the update.
2.
Require that all entities disclose certain disaggregated information regarding income taxes paid.
3.
Require that all entities disclose certain disaggregated information regarding income tax expense.
4.
Eliminate the requirement to: (1) disclose the nature and estimate of the range of reasonably possible changes in the unrecognized tax benefits balance in the next 12 months or (2) make a statement that an estimate of the range cannot be made.
5.
Remove the requirement to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a deferred tax liability is not recognized because of exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures.
For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption should be done on a prospective basis and retrospective application is permitted.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income–Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40).
 The amendments in this update require disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments require that at each interim and annual reporting period an entity:
1.
Disclose the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) intangible asset amortization, and (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil and gas-producing activities (or other amounts of depletion expense) included in each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations that contains any of the expense categories listed in (a)–(e).
2.
Include certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current GAAP in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements.
3.
Disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively.
113
4.
Disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.
For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2024-03 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update are to be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this update or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements.
Relevant standards that were adopted during the year ended December 31, 2024:
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, 
Investments–Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method 
(“ASU 2023-02”). This update permits reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if the following conditions are met:
1.
It is probable that the income tax credits allocable to the tax equity investor will be available.
2.
The tax equity investor does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the underlying project.
3.
Substantially all of the projected benefits are from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. Projected benefits include income tax credits, other income tax benefits, and other non-income-tax-related benefits. The projected benefits are determined on a discounted basis, using a discount rate that is consistent with the cash flow assumptions used by the tax equity investor in making its decision to invest in the project.
4.
The tax equity investor’s projected yield based solely on the cash flows from the income tax credits and other income tax benefits is positive.
5.
The tax equity investor is a limited liability investor in the limited liability entity for both legal and tax purposes, and the tax equity investor’s liability is limited to its capital investment.
Under previously effective accounting standards, the proportional amortization method was allowable only for equity investments in low-income-housing tax credit structures. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). Updates made by ASU 2023-02 allow a reporting entity to make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis. The Company had previously made an accounting policy election to account for its investments in low-income-housing tax credit investments using the proportional amortization method. This election was made upon the Company’s adoption of ASU 2014-01, 
Investments–Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects
, which introduced the option to apply proportional amortization to low-income-housing tax credit investments
.
 The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2024 and such adoption did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The amendments in this update are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update:
1.
Require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss (collectively referred to as the “significant expense principle”).
2.
Require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. The other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss.
3.
Require that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
 in interim periods.

Clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit. However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements. In other words, in addition to the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles under U.S. GAAP, a public entity is 
114
not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss that are used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
5.
Require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
6.
Require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mergers and Acquisitions
Cambridge Bancorp, Inc. Merger
On July 12, 2024, the Company completed its merger with Cambridge. In accordance with the merger agreement, each share of Cambridge common stock was exchanged for 
4.956
 shares of Company common stock. The transaction qualified as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes and provided Cambridge shareholders with a tax-free exchange of their shares of Cambridge common stock for Company common stock as the consideration they received in the merger. In connection with the merger, Citadel MS 2023, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into Cambridge, with Cambridge continuing as the surviving entity. Immediately after the merger, Cambridge merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. Immediately following, Cambridge Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cambridge, merged with and into Eastern Bank, with Eastern Bank continuing as the surviving entity. The Company issued 
38.9
 million shares of its common stock in the merger. Based upon the closing price of Company common stock on July 12, 2024 of $
14.87
 per share, the transaction is valued at $
580.6
 million, which includes cash paid in-lieu of fractional shares and recognition of restricted stock units (“RSU”) and performance share units (“PSU”) service accruals for service accrued by Cambridge personnel prior to the merger. In addition to increasing its loan and deposit base, the merger enabled the Company to expand its wealth management customer base and service offerings, which includes comprehensive investment management, as well as trust administration, estate settlement, and financial planning services.
The merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
. Under this method of accounting, the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values. The excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired totaled $
357.3
 million and was recorded as goodwill. The results of Cambridge’s operations were included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent to the merger date.
The calculation of goodwill is subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the transaction as additional information relative to closing date estimates and uncertainties becomes available, including the filing of the 2024 tax return for Cambridge. As the Company finalizes its analysis of these assets and liabilities, there may be adjustments to the recorded carrying values.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of merger from Cambridge:

The FHLB advances assumed were overnight borrowings which matured immediately following the completion of the merger and therefore were not adjusted to fair value.
Fair Value Measurement of Assets Assumed and Liabilities Assumed
The methods used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cambridge merger were as follows:
Investment Securities
The estimated fair values of the available for sale debt securities and held-to-maturity debt securities, primarily comprised of U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises obligations, corporate debt securities, municipal securities, and U.S. Treasury securities carried on Cambridge’s balance sheet, was confirmed using actual sales quotations from sales of the securities, as the Company sold all of the acquired securities immediately following the closing of the merger. Based upon management’s determination, a fair value adjustment of $
158.9
 million, reflecting a net discount, was recorded on acquired securities and reflects the net unrealized loss position of such securities at the date of merger. Securities acquired that were classified on Cambridge’s balance sheet as held-to-maturity were reclassified as available for sale upon the completion of the merger and prior to sale by the Company, reflecting management’s intent with respect to such securities.
Immediately following the completion of the merger, investment securities acquired through its merger with Cambridge paid down or were sold in their entirety. 
No
 gain or loss was recognized upon sale as such securities had been recorded by the Company based upon the quoted sale prices in determination of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment. 
Loans
Loans acquired in the Cambridge merger were recorded at fair value, and there was no carryover of the allowance for loan losses. The fair value of the loans acquired from Cambridge was determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, as adjusted for an estimate 
116
of future credit losses and prepayments, and then applying a market-based discount rate to those cash flows. Management retained a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair values of loans acquired, the results of which were reviewed by management. The resulting total fair value mark was estimated to be a discount of $
277.0
 million.
Acquired loans were reviewed to determine if any had experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Loans meeting established criteria to indicate more-than-insignificant deterioration were identified as purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans, and an allowance for loan losses was calculated using management’s best estimate of projected losses over the remaining life of the loan in accordance with current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. In connection with the Cambridge merger, the Company recorded an allowance for loan losses on PCD loans of approximately $
55.8
 million, which was added to the amortized cost of loans.
The following is a reconciliation of the difference between the purchase price and par value of PCD loans acquired in the merger:

)
Purchase price of PCD loans (at fair value)

For loans acquired without evidence of more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, also referred to as non-PCD loans, the Company estimated an allowance for loan losses based on the Company's methodology for determining the allowance under CECL. The resulting allowance on non-PCD loans was $
40.9
 million, which was recorded through a charge to provision for loan losses on the date of merger.
Premises and Equipment
The Company acquired 
18
 branches in the merger as of the date of closing, five of which were owned premises. In addition, the Company acquired 
two
 corporate properties in the merger with Cambridge. The fair value of properties acquired was derived by valuations prepared by an independent third party utilizing a combination of the income approach and the sales comparison approach to value the property as improved.
Leases
As part of the merger the Company added 
23
 lease obligations. The Company recorded a $
25.5
 million right-of-use asset and a $
32.0
 million lease liability for these lease obligations. Lease assets and liabilities were measured using a methodology to estimate the future rental payments over the remaining lease term with discounting using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease term was determined for individual leases based on the Company’s assessment of the probability of exercising renewal options. The net effect of any off-market terms in a lease was also discounted and applied to the balance of the lease asset. 
Core Deposit Intangible
The fair value of the core deposit intangible was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate commensurate with market participants. To calculate cash flows, deposit account servicing costs (net of deposit fee income) and interest expense on deposits were compared to the cost of alternative funding sources available through FHLBB borrowing rates and national brokered CD offering rates. The projected cash flows were developed using projected deposit attrition rates. Management retained a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the determination of projected cash flows, the results of which were reviewed by management. The core deposit intangible totaled $
115.0
 million and is being amortized on a cash-flow weighted basis over its estimated useful life of 
7
 years.
Cambridge Trust Wealth Management Customer List and Trade Name Intangibles
The fair value of the Cambridge Trust wealth management customer list intangible (“customer list intangible”) and trade name intangible (“trade name intangible”) were determined based upon discounted cash flow analyses using discount rates commensurate with market participants. The projected cash flows for the customer list intangible were developed using current revenue grown at a constant rate, and projected customer attrition rates were used to allocate those revenues to existing customers. Adjustments were made to the projected cash flows to account for sales and marketing expenses as well as contributory asset charges associated with the customer list. The discounted cash flows for the trade name intangible were developed using current revenue grown at a constant rate, multiplied by a royalty rate determined based on market observations. 
117
Management retained a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the determination of the projected cash flows, the results of which were reviewed by management. The estimated fair value of the customer list and trade name intangibles amounted to $
25.0
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively, and are being amortized on a cash-flow weighted basis over their estimated useful lives of 
11
 years and 
5
 years, respectively.
Goodwill
The calculation of goodwill is subject to change for up to one year after the date of merger as additional information relative to the closing date estimates and uncertainties become available. As the Company finalizes its review of the acquired assets and liabilities, certain adjustments to the recorded carrying values may be required. The goodwill will be evaluated annually for impairment. The goodwill is 
no
t deductible for tax purposes.
Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”)
Cambridge’s BOLI cash surrender value was $
35.7
 million with no fair value adjustment.
Certificates of Deposit
The fair value adjustment for certificates of deposit represents a discount from the value of the contractual repayments of fixed-maturity deposits using prevailing market interest rates for similar-term time deposits. The certificate of deposit discount, which was estimated to be $
1.6
 million, is being amortized into income on a level yield amortization method over the contractual life of the deposits.
Escrow Deposits of Borrowers
Cambridge’s escrow deposits of borrowers was $
3.6
 million with no fair value adjustment.
Merger-Related Expenses
The Company recorded merger and acquisition expenses of $
36.7
 million and $
5.5
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the Cambridge merger. 
These merger and acquisition expenses were included in the following line items of the Consolidated Statements of Income:

The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma information for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. This unaudited estimated pro forma financial information was calculated as if the merger had occurred as of January 1, 2023. This unaudited pro forma information combines the historical results of Cambridge with the Company’s consolidated historical results and includes certain adjustments reflecting the estimated impact of certain fair value adjustments for the respective periods. The pro forma information is not indicative of what would have occurred had the merger occurred as of the beginning of the year prior to the merger. The unaudited pro forma information does not consider any changes to the provision for loan losses resulting from recording loan assets at fair value, cost savings, or business synergies. 
As a result, actual amounts would have differed from the unaudited pro forma information presented.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell these investments and has determined based upon available evidence that it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell each security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis. As a result, the Company did not recognize an ACL on these investments as of either December 31, 2024 or 2023.
The causes of the impairments listed in the tables above by category are as follows as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:
120
•
Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Agency bonds and U.S. Treasury securities
 – The securities with unrealized losses in these portfolios have contractual terms that generally do not permit the issuer to settle the security at a price less than the current par value of the investment. The decline in market value of these securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. Additionally, these securities are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies.
•
State and municipal bonds and obligations
 – The securities with unrealized losses in this portfolio have contractual terms that generally do not permit the issuer to settle the security at a price less than the current par value of the investment. The decline in market value of these securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality.

Mortgage-backed securities include investments in securities that are insured or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae. Mortgage-backed securities are purchased to achieve positive interest rate spread with minimal administrative expense, and to lower the Company’s credit risk. Mortgage-backed securities and callable securities are shown at their contractual maturity dates. However, both are expected to have shorter average lives due to expected prepayments and callable features, respectively. Included in the above maturity tables as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
196.4
 million, and $
394.4
 million, respectively, of callable securities at fair value. 
Securities Pledged as Collateral
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, securities with a carrying value of $
687.9
 million and $
615.7
 million, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes required by law. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deposits with associated pledged collateral included cash accounts from the Company’s wealth management division (“Cambridge Trust Wealth Management”), which was formerly operated under the name “Eastern Wealth Management,” and municipal deposit accounts. As of December 31, 2024, securities with a carrying value of $
1.0
 billion were pledged as collateral to the FHLBB. 
No
 securities were pledged to the FHLBB as collateral as of December 31, 2023.
In March 2023 the Federal Reserve created the Bank Term Funding Program (the “Program”) that offered eligible depository institutions loans up to one year in length in return for any collateral eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve Banks in open market operations, such as U.S. Treasuries. As of December 31, 2023, securities with a carrying value of $
2.4

123
billion were pledged as collateral through the Program. On January 24, 2024, the Federal Reserve Board announced the Program would cease making new loans as scheduled on March 11, 2024. Accordingly, 
no
 securities were pledged as collateral under the Program as of December 31, 2024. Separately, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company pledged securities with a carrying value of $
794.8
 million and $
168.8
 million, respectively, to the Federal Reserve Discount Window (the “Discount Window”).

The balance of accrued interest receivable excluded from amortized cost and the calculation of the allowance for loan losses amounted to $
66.7
 million and $
53.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 
2023
, respectively, and is included within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
There are no other loan categories that exceed 10% of total loans not already reflected in the preceding table.
The Company’s lending activities are conducted principally in the New England area with the exception of its Shared National Credit Program (“SNC Program”) portfolio and certain purchased loans. The Company participates in the SNC Program in an effort to improve its industry and geographical diversification. The SNC Program portfolio is included in the Company’s commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and commercial construction portfolios. The SNC Program portfolio is defined as loan syndications with exposure over $
100
 million and with three or more lenders participating.
Most loans originated by the Company are either collateralized by real estate or other assets or guaranteed by federal and local governmental authorities. The ability and willingness of the single-family residential and consumer borrowers to honor their repayment commitments is generally dependent on the level of overall economic activity within the borrowers’ geographic areas and real estate values. The ability and willingness of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and construction loan borrowers to honor their repayment commitments is generally dependent on the health of the real estate economy in the borrowers’ geographic areas and the general economy.
Loans Pledged as Collateral
The carrying value of loans pledged to secure advances from the FHLBB were $
2.3
 billion and $
4.6
 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The balance of funds borrowed from the FHLBB were $
17.6
 million and $
17.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The carrying value of loans pledged to secure advances from the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) was $
3.1
 billion and $
1.1
 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were 
no
 funds borrowed from the FRB outstanding at either December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Serviced Loans
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, mortgage loans partially or wholly-owned by others and serviced by the Company amounted to $
228.4
 million and $
77.2
 million, respectively. The increase in loans serviced from December 31, 2023 
124
to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the merger and the acquisition of the portfolio of mortgage loans partially or wholly-owned by others and previously serviced by Cambridge.
Purchased Loans
The Company began purchasing residential real estate mortgage loans during the third quarter of 2022 and ceased such purchases in the first quarter of 2023. Loans purchased were subject to the same underwriting criteria as those loans originated directly by the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did 
not
 purchase any residential real estate mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company purchased $
32.0
 million of residential real estate mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amortized cost balance of loans purchased was $
367.0
 million and $
385.5
 million, respectively.
Commercial Loan Sales
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did 
not
 sell any commercial and industrial loans. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold $
214.2
 million of commercial and industrial loans previously included in the SNC program portfolio and recognized a loss on sale of $
2.7
 million.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is established to provide for management’s estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on loans measured at amortized cost at the balance sheet date through a provision for loan losses charged to net income. Charge-offs, net of recoveries, are charged directly to the allowance for loan losses. Commercial and residential loans are charged-off in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Delinquent loans in these product types are subject to ongoing review and analysis to determine if a charge-off in the current period is appropriate. For consumer loans, policies and procedures exist that require charge-off consideration upon a certain triggering event depending on the product type.
The following tables summarize the change in the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated:

R
epresents the adjustment needed to reflect the cumulative day one impact pursuant to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-13 (i.e., cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2022). The adjustment represents a $
27.1
 million increase to the allowance attributable to the change in accounting methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses resulting from the Company’s adoption of the standard. The adjustment also includes the adjustment needed to reflect the day one reclassification of the Company’s PCI loan balances to PCD and the associated gross-up of $
0.1
 million, pursuant to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-13.
The Company recorded provisions for allowance for loan losses of $
67.4
 million and $
20.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for allowance for loan losses of $
40.9
 million related to non-PCD loans acquired in the merger which closed on July 12, 2024. Excluding this amount, the provision for the year ended December 31, 2024 amounted to $
26.5
 million. Management determined a provision to be necessary for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to $
42.6
 million in charge-offs of commercial real estate loans and due to an increase in specific reserves for commercial real estate loans collateralized by property in the office risk segment. Included in charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $
41.3
 million of charge-offs on loans collateralized by property in the office risk segment which transitioned to non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2024 and were not reserved for on a specific reserve basis as of December 31, 2023, and $
19.8
 million of charge-offs on PCD loans acquired in the merger with Cambridge. Also contributing to the increase in the allowance for loan losses was an initial reserve of $
55.8
 million recorded by the Company related to PCD loans acquired in the merger with Cambridge. This amount represented the initial allowance on such loans and was recorded with a corresponding gross-up of the loan amortized cost balance in connection with purchase accounting therefore not increasing the provision for allowance for loan losses. Refer to 
Note 3, “Mergers and Acquisitions”
 for additional discussion. 
Change in Accounting Estimate
In connection with its quarterly computation of the allowance for loan losses, management performs back-testing of the model results compared to actual balances and losses as a part of generating the accounting estimate. In the third quarter of 2024, in response to back-testing results, management updated its prepayment estimate, resulting in an increase to the loan portfolio’s weighted average life, and qualitative reserve framework which reflects management’s best estimate of expected credit losses. The net effect of the such changes to the allowance for loan losses estimation process was an increase of approximately $
5.6
 million.
Reserve for Unfunded Commitments
Management evaluates the need for a reserve on unfunded lending commitments in a manner consistent with loans held for investment. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $
13.1
 million and $
14.1
 million, respectively, which is recorded within other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Portfolio Segmentation
126
Management uses a methodology to systematically estimate the amount of expected losses in each segment of loans in the Company’s portfolio. Commercial and industrial business banking, investment commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans are evaluated based upon loan-level risk characteristics, historical losses and other factors which form the basis for estimating expected losses. Other portfolios, including owner occupied commercial real estate (which includes business banking owner occupied commercial real estate), commercial construction, residential mortgages, home equity and consumer loans, are analyzed as groups taking into account delinquency ratios, and the Company’s and peer banks’ historical loss experience. For the purposes of estimating the allowance for loan losses, management segregates the loan portfolio into loan categories that share similar risk characteristics such as the purpose of the loan, repayment source, and collateral. These characteristics are considered when determining the appropriate level of the allowance for each category. Some examples of these risk characteristics unique to each loan category include:
Commercial Lending
Commercial and industrial
: The primary risk associated with commercial and industrial loans is the ability of borrowers to achieve business results consistent with those projected at origination. Collateral frequently consists of a first lien position on business assets including, but not limited to, accounts receivable, inventory, aircraft and equipment. The primary repayment source is operating cash flow and, secondarily, the liquidation of assets. Under its lending guidelines, the Company generally requires a corporate or personal guarantee from any entity or individual that holds a material ownership in the borrowing entity when the loan-to-value of a commercial and industrial loan is in excess of a specified threshold.
Commercial real estate
: Collateral values are established by independent third-party appraisals and evaluations. Primary repayment sources include operating income generated by the real estate, permanent debt refinancing, sale of the real estate and, secondarily, liquidation of the collateral. Under its lending guidelines, the Company generally requires a corporate or personal guarantee from individuals that hold material ownership in the borrowing entity when the loan-to-value of a commercial real estate loan is in excess of a specified threshold.
Commercial construction
: These loans are generally considered to present a higher degree of risk than other real estate loans and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as adverse changes in interest rates and the borrower’s ability to control costs and adhere to time schedules. Construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. Construction loan repayment is substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to complete the project and obtain permanent financing.
Business banking
: These loans are typically secured by all business assets or commercial real estate. Business banking originations include traditionally underwritten loans as well as partially automated scored loans. Business banking scored loans are determined by utilizing the Company’s proprietary decision matrix that has a number of quantitative factors including, but not limited to, a guarantor’s credit score, industry risk, and time in business. The Company also engages in Small Business Association (“SBA”) lending. The SBA guarantees reduce the Company’s loss due to default and are considered a credit enhancement to the loan structure.
Residential Lending
These loans are made to borrowers who demonstrate the ability to repay principal and interest on a monthly basis. Underwriting considerations include, among others, income sources and their reliability, willingness to repay as evidenced by credit repayment history, financial resources (including cash reserves) and the value of the collateral. The Company maintains policy standards for minimum credit score and cash reserves and maximum loan-to-value consistent with a “prime” portfolio. Collateral consists of mortgage liens on 1-4 family residential dwellings. The policy standards applied to loans originated by the Company are the same as those applied to purchased loans. The Company does not originate or purchase sub-prime or other high-risk loans. Residential loans are originated either for sale to investors or retained in the Company’s loan portfolio. Decisions about whether to sell or retain residential loans are made based on the interest rate characteristics, pricing for loans in the secondary mortgage market, competitive factors and the Company’s liquidity and capital needs.
Consumer Lending
Consumer home equity
: Home equity lines of credit are granted for ten years with monthly interest-only repayment requirements. At the end of the ten-year draw period, home equity lines of credit are amortized over the remaining maturity period and monthly payments of principal and interest are required. Home equity loans are term loans that require the monthly payment of principal and interest such that the loan will be fully amortized at maturity. Underwriting considerations are materially consistent with those utilized in residential real estate. Collateral consists of a senior or subordinate lien on owner-occupied residential property.
127
Other consumer
: The Company’s policy and underwriting in this category, which is comprised primarily of home improvement, automobile and aircraft loans, include the following factors, among others: income sources and reliability, credit histories, term of repayment, and collateral value, as applicable. These are typically granted on an unsecured basis, with the exception of aircraft and automobile loans.
Credit Quality
Commercial Lending Credit Quality
The credit quality of the Company’s commercial loan portfolio is actively monitored and supported by a comprehensive credit approval process and all large dollar transactions are sent for approval to a committee of seasoned business line and credit professionals. The Company maintains an independent credit risk review function that reports directly to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. Credits that demonstrate significant deterioration in credit quality are transferred to a specialized group of experienced officers for individual attention.
The Company monitors credit quality indicators and utilizes portfolio scorecards to assess the risk of its commercial portfolio. Specifically, the Company utilizes a 15-point credit risk-rating system to manage risk and identify potential problem loans. Under this point system, risk-rating assignments are based upon a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that are under continual review. Factors include cash flow, collateral coverage, liquidity, leverage, position within the industry, internal controls and management, financial reporting, and other considerations. Commercial loan risk ratings are (re)evaluated for each loan at least once-per-year. The risk-rating categories under the credit risk-rating system are defined as follows:
0 Risk Rating- Unrated
Certain segments of the portfolios are not rated. These segments include aircraft loans, business banking scored loan products, and other commercial loans managed by exception. Loans within this unrated loan segment are monitored by delinquency status; and for lines of credit greater than $
100,000
 in exposure, an annual review is conducted which includes the review of the business score and loan and deposit account performance. The Company supplements performance data with current business credit scores for the business banking portfolio on a quarterly basis. Unrated commercial and business banking loans are generally restricted to commercial exposure of less than $
1.5
 million. Loans included in this category generally are not required to provide regular financial reporting or regular covenant monitoring.
For purposes of estimating the allowance for loan losses, unrated loans are considered in the same manner as “Pass” rated loans. Unrated loans are included with “Pass” rated loans for disclosure purposes.
1-10 Risk Rating – Pass
Loans with a risk rating of 1-10 are classified as “Pass” and are comprised of loans that range from “substantially risk free” which indicates borrowers of unquestioned credit standing, well-established national companies with a very strong financial condition, and loans fully secured by policy conforming cash levels, through “low pass” which indicates acceptable rated loans that may be experiencing weak cash flow, impending lease rollover or minor liquidity concerns.
11 Risk Rating – Special Mention (Potential Weakness)
Loans to borrowers in this category exhibit potential weaknesses or downward trends deserving management’s close attention. While potentially weak, no loss of principal or interest is envisioned. Included in this category are borrowers who are performing as agreed, are weak when compared to industry standards, may be experiencing an interim loss and may be in declining industries. An element of asset quality, financial flexibility or management is below average. The Company does not consider borrowers within this category as new business prospects. Borrowers rated special mention may find it difficult to obtain alternative financing from traditional bank sources.
12 Risk Rating – Substandard (Well-Defined Weakness)
Loans with a risk-rating of 12 exhibit well-defined weaknesses that, if not corrected, may jeopardize the orderly liquidation of the debt. A loan is classified as substandard if it is inadequately protected by the repayment capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged. Specifically, repayment under market rates and terms, or by the requirements under the existing loan documents, is in jeopardy, but no loss of principal or interest is envisioned. There is a possibility that a partial loss of principal and/or interest will occur in the future if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate portfolio of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified as substandard. Non-accrual is possible, but not mandatory, in this class.
128
13 Risk Rating – Doubtful (Loss Probable)
Loans classified as doubtful have comparable weaknesses as found in the loans classified as substandard, with the added provision that such weaknesses make collection of the debt in full (based on currently existing facts, conditions and values) highly questionable and improbable. Serious problems exist such that a partial loss of principal is likely. The probability of loss exists, but because of reasonably specific pending factors that may work to strengthen the credit, estimated losses are deferred until a more exact status can be determined. Specific reserves will be the amount identified after specific review. Non-accrual is mandatory in this class.
14 Risk Rating – Loss
Loans to borrowers in this category are deemed incapable of repayment. Loans to such borrowers are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as active assets of the Company is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loans have no recovery or salvage value, but rather, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these assets even though partial recovery may occur in the future. Loans in this category have a recorded investment of $0 at the time of the downgrade.
Residential and Consumer Lending Credit Quality
For the Company’s residential and consumer portfolios, the quality of the loan is best indicated by the repayment performance of an individual borrower. Updated appraisals, broker opinions of value and other collateral valuation methods are employed in the residential and consumer portfolios, typically for credits that are deteriorating. Delinquency status is determined using payment performance, while accrual status may be determined using a combination of payment performance, expected borrower viability and collateral value. Delinquent consumer loans are handled by a team of seasoned collection specialists.

Asset Quality
131
The Company manages its loan portfolio with careful monitoring. As a general rule, loans more than 90 days past due with respect to principal and interest are classified as non-accrual loans. Exceptions may be made if management believes that collateral held by the Company is clearly sufficient and in full satisfaction of both principal and interest. The Company may also use discretion regarding other loans over 
90
 days delinquent if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans and loans that are more than 
90
 days past due but still accruing interest are considered non-performing loans.
Non-accrual loans may be returned to an accrual status when principal and interest payments are no longer delinquent, and the risk characteristics of the loan have improved to the extent that there no longer exists a concern as to the collectability of principal and interest. Loans are considered past due based upon the number of days delinquent according to their contractual terms. 
A loan is expected to remain on non-accrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest, the loan is liquidated, or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses.
The following tables show the age analysis of past due loans as of the dates indicated:

The loans on non-accrual status and without an ACL as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were primarily comprised of collateral dependent loans for which the fair value of the underlying loan collateral exceeded the loan carrying value.
The amount of interest income recognized on non-accrual loans during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not significant. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing.
It is the Company’s policy to reverse any accrued interest when a loan is put on non-accrual status and, generally, to record any payments received from a borrower related to a loan on non-accrual status as a reduction of the amortized cost basis of the loan. Accrued interest reversed against interest income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not significant.
For collateral values for residential mortgage and home equity loans, the Company relies primarily upon third-party valuation information from certified appraisers and values are generally based upon recent appraisals of the underlying collateral, brokers’ opinions based upon recent sales of comparable properties, or estimated auction or liquidation values less estimated costs to sell. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had collateral-dependent residential mortgage and home equity loans totaling $
1.1
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively.
For collateral-dependent commercial loans, the amount of the allowance for loan losses is individually assessed based upon the fair value of the collateral. Various types of collateral are used, including real estate, inventory, equipment, accounts receivable, securities and cash, among others. For commercial real estate loans, the Company relies primarily upon third-party valuation information from certified appraisers and values are generally based upon recent appraisals of the underlying collateral, brokers’ opinions based upon recent sales of comparable properties, estimated equipment auction or liquidation values, income capitalization, or a combination of income capitalization and comparable sales. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had collateral-dependent commercial loans totaling $
107.7
 million and $
30.7
 million, respectively. The increase in collateral-dependent commercial loans at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to collateral-dependent PCD loans acquired in connection with the Company’s merger with Cambridge.
Appraisals for all loan types are obtained at the time of loan origination as part of the loan approval process and are updated at the time of a loan modification and/or refinance and as considered necessary by management for impairment review purposes. In addition, appraisals are updated as required by regulatory pronouncements.
As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no residential real estate held in other real estate owned (“OREO”). As of December 31, 2024, there were 
four
 residential real estate loans, which had an aggregate balance of $
0.4
 million, collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in-process. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
two
 residential real estate loans, which had an aggregate balance of $
0.2
 million, collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in-process. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
six
 consumer home equity loans, which had an aggregate balance of $
0.5
 million, collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in-process. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
three

0.2

Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDR”)
As described previously in 
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,”
 the Company adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023 which eliminated TDR accounting. Previously, in cases where a borrower experienced financial difficulty and the Company made certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan was classified as a TDR. The process through which management identified loans as TDR loans, the methodology employed to record any loan losses, and the calculation of any shortfall on collateral dependent loans is described within 
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
 The below disclosures regarding TDRs relate to prior periods and were included for comparative purposes.
The Company’s policy was to have any TDR loan which was on non-accrual status prior to being modified remain on non-accrual status for approximately six months subsequent to being modified before management considered its return to accrual status. If the TDR loan was on accrual status prior to being modified, it was reviewed to determine if the modified loan should remain on accrual status.
TDR loan information for the year ended December 31, 2022 was prepared in accordance with GAAP effective for the Company prior to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2022-02.
The following tables show the modifications which occurred during the periods indicated and the change in the recorded investment subsequent to the modifications occurring:

 leases, which had not previously been included in its determination of future lease payments, and to terminate 
one
 lease. Accordingly, the Company remeasured the present value of the future lease payments related to such leases which resulted in a net reduction of the lease liabilities and a corresponding net reduction of the 
139
lease ROU assets of $
2.4
 million. In connection with the lease terminations, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $
0.4

The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change which might indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. The Company has identified and assigned goodwill to 
one
 reporting unit - the banking business unit.
In accordance with the accounting guidance codified in ASC 350-20, the Company performs a test of goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis. An assessment is also required to be performed to the extent relevant events and/or 
140
circumstances occur which may indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
The Company performed its annual assessment for the banking business as of September 30, 2024. The assessment included a comparison of the banking reporting unit’s carrying value of equity to estimated fair value of equity using the market capitalization method of the market approach. The Company evaluated conditions as of the assessment date and how a market participant would evaluate a control premium for the banking reporting unit. The implied control premium was estimated using the discounted cash flow method of the income approach by evaluating the present value of market participant cost savings and synergies. Based upon the assessment, it was determined there was 
no
 impairment of the Company’s goodwill as of September 30, 2024.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, management elected to change the annual date at which it assesses goodwill for impairment from September 30 to November 30. Management considered the accounting guidance codified in ASC 250 in assessing the appropriateness of the change and the method for applying the change. The assessment included an evaluation of the justification of the change noting an assessment date of November 30 is preferable to September 30 as management’s process for determining future period forecasted earnings for budgeting purposes, a key input in the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, occurs in the fourth quarter. Previously, future period forecasted earnings were estimated as of September 30 to support the annual goodwill impairment assessment and later updated in the fourth quarter for budgeting purposes and to support impairment evaluations performed as of December 31. Thus, moving the annual assessment date to November 30 allows for a more accurate estimate of future forecasted earnings to be used in its quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment. In addition, based upon the assessment performed, management determined the change should be applied prospectively beginning with an assessment performed as of November 30, 2024 as a retrospective application of this change in accounting principle would require the use of assumptions and estimations developed with the use of hindsight, which is not appropriate for the annual goodwill impairment assessment. Management believes the change in goodwill impairment testing date does not represent a material change to the method of applying an accounting principle in light of the internal controls over financial reporting and requirements to assess goodwill impairment upon certain triggering events, and does not delay, accelerate or avoid any impairment charges. In addition, the Company last performed an assessment as of November 30, 2024 as an update to the September 30, 2024 annual test. As such, no more than 12 months will have elapsed between the previous assessment and the next annual assessment as of November 30, 2025.
The Company performed its annual assessment for the banking business as of November 30, 2024, the Company’s new annual assessment date as described above. The assessment included a comparison of the banking reporting unit’s carrying value of equity to estimated fair value of equity based on the Company’s market capitalization. The assessment also considered the changes in market conditions from the September 30, 2024 assessment. Based upon the assessment, it was determined there was 
no
 impairment of the Company’s goodwill as of November 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there was no effect to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the change in annual assessment date.
The amortization expense of the Company’s other intangible assets was $
14.6
 million, $
1.8
 million, and $
1.2
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 2023 was attributable to amortization expense recorded in the third and fourth quarter of 2024 related to other intangible assets acquired in connection with the Company’s merger with Cambridge.
The weighted average original amortization period and weighted average remaining useful life of the Company’s other intangible assets is 
7.8
 years and 
7.0
 years, respectively. Management performs an assessment of the remaining useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets on a quarterly basis to determine if such lives remain appropriate.
The estimated amortization expense for the remaining useful life of the Company’s other intangible assets is as follows:

Earnings Per Share (
“
EPS
”
)
Basic EPS represents income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares (such as stock options) were exercised or converted into additional common shares that would then share in the earnings of the Company. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year, plus the effect of potential dilutive common share equivalents computed using the treasury stock method. Shares held by the ESOP that have not been allocated or committed to be allocated to employees in accordance with the terms of the ESOP, referred to as “unallocated ESOP shares,” are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations.

Low Income Housing Tax Credits and Other Tax Credit Investments
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate income. The Company has primarily invested in separate LIHTC projects, also referred to as qualified affordable housing projects, which provide the Company with tax credits and operating loss tax benefits over a period of 
15
 years. The return on these investments is generally generated through tax credits and tax losses. In addition to LIHTC projects, the Company invests in new market tax credit projects that qualify for CRA credits and eligible projects that qualify for renewable energy and historic tax credits.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
222.7
 million and $
223.4
 million, respectively, in tax credit investments that were included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
When permissible, the Company accounts for its investments in LIHTC projects and other qualifying investments using the proportional amortization method, under which it amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the amount of the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes that amortization as a component of income tax expense. The net investment in the housing projects is included in other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company will continue to use the proportional amortization method on any new qualifying investments.

51.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes a $
7.4
 million lost state tax benefit for Massachusetts as the Company was in a tax loss position for 2024 and loss carryover is not allowed by the state. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to pretax losses which largely resulted from losses on sales of available for sale securities in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, during the first quarter of 2023, the Company liquidated Market Street Securities Corporation (“MSSC”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and transferred all of MSSC’s assets to Eastern Bank. In connection with the liquidation and subsequent transfer of securities previously held by MSSC to Eastern Bank, the Company recognized an additional deferred income tax benefit of $
23.7
 million during the first quarter of 2023. This deferred income tax benefit resulted from a state tax rate change applied to the deferred tax asset related to the securities transferred to Eastern Bank.

The Company assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company considers projections of future taxable income during the 
147
periods in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are scheduled to reverse. Additionally, in determining the availability of operating loss carrybacks and other tax attributes, both projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies are considered in making this assessment. Tax losses from the sale of investments acquired in the merger, which occurred in the third quarter of 2024, resulted in lower projections of 2025 taxable income. As a result of those losses, as of December 31, 2024, the Company believes that a portion of the associated charitable contribution carryforward will expire on December 31, 2025 unutilized and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance for $
2.8
 million. As of December 31, 2024, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the remainder of its net deferred tax assets. 
Management performed an evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and determined that liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $
1.8
 million and $
3.8
 million, respectively, was needed related to state tax positions. The decrease was primarily due to a reversal of $
1.9
 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated:

As of December 31, 2024, the amount that would reduce the effective tax rate, if recognized, is $
1.8
 million. The reduction in the effective tax rate is inclusive of the federal benefit for unrecognized state tax benefits, and accrued interest and penalties. The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate. The Company recognizes penalties and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. Accrued penalties and interest amounted to $
0.5
 million and $
1.0
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in accrued penalties and interest for the current year impacted the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of income tax expense by $
0.5
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $
1.9
 million of unrecognized state tax benefits and $
0.7
 million of interest and penalties reversed upon expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year to which the reserve was related. Management anticipates that approximately $
1.6
 million of unrecognized state tax benefits and $
0.6
 million of interest and penalties will reverse in 2025 upon expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year to which the reserve is related.
The Company had $
23.8
 million in net operating loss carryforwards for federal or state income tax purposes at December 31, 2024. The Company had 
no
 net operating loss carryforwards for federal or state income tax purposes at December 31, 2023.
At December 31, 2024, the Bank’s federal pre-1988 reserve, for which no federal income tax provision has been made, was approximately $
20.8
 million. Under current federal law, these reserves are subject to recapture into taxable income, should the Company make non-dividend distributions, make distributions in excess of earnings and profits retained, as defined, or cease to maintain a banking type charter.

A deferred tax liability is not recognized for the base year amount unless it becomes apparent that those temporary differences will reverse into taxable income in the foreseeable future. No deferred tax liability has been established as these two events are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
The Company’s primary banking activities are in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island; however, the Company also files additional state corporate income and/or franchise tax returns in states in which the Company has a filing requirement. The methods of filing, and the methods for calculating taxable and apportionable income, vary depending upon the laws of the taxing jurisdiction.
The Company is subject to routine audits of its tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities. The Company is no longer subject to federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2021.
The Company invests in low-income affordable housing and renewable energy projects which provide the Company with tax benefits, including tax credits, generally over a period of approximately 5-15 years. When permissible, the 
148
Company accounts for its investments in Low Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) projects using the proportional amortization method, under which it amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the amount of the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes that amortization as a component of income tax expense. The net investment performance in the housing projects is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company will continue to use the proportional amortization method on any new qualifying LIHTC investments. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated federal tax credits primarily from LIHTC investments of $
16.5
 million and $
9.2
 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated flow-through state tax credits from LIHTC investments of $
0.3
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company generated $
3.2
 million in directly purchased Massachusetts state tax credits associated LIHTC investments. The Company treats the investment tax credits received as a reduction of federal income taxes for the year in which the credit arises using the flow-through method (i.e., the credit flows directly through the statement of income in the year of purchase). For additional information on these investments, refer to 
Note 12, “Low Income Housing Tax Credits and Other Tax Credit Investments.”
14. 
Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies, including U.S. Basel III. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by the regulators to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum capital amounts and ratios. All banking companies are required to have total regulatory capital of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets, common equity Tier 1 capital of at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, core capital (“Tier 1”) of at least 6% of risk-weighted assets, and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% of adjusted average assets.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was categorized as “well-capitalized” based on the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the Company must maintain (1) a minimum total regulatory capital ratio of 10%; (2) a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (3) a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% and (4) a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. Management believes that the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. There have been no conditions or events that management believes would cause a change in the Company’s categorization.
The Company’s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table as of the dates indicated:

The Company is subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that have been entered into with secondary market investors. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in an inability to originate and service loans for the respective investor and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Management believes that the Company met all capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Employee Benefits
Pension Plans
The Company provides pension benefits for its employees using a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit plan, through membership in SBERA. SBERA offers a common and collective trust as the underlying investment structure for pension plans participating in the association. The target allocation mix for the common and collective trust portfolio calls for an equity-based investment deployment range of 
49
% to 
63
% of total common and collective trust portfolio assets. The remainder of the common and collective trust’s portfolio is allocated to fixed income securities with a target range of 
28
% to 
42
% and other investments, including global asset allocation and hedge funds, from 
3
% to 
12
%. The Trustees of SBERA, through SBERA's Investment Committee, select investment managers for the common and collective trust portfolio. A professional investment advisory firm is retained by the Investment Committee to provide allocation analysis and performance measurement, and to assist with manager searches. The overall investment objective is to diversify investments across a spectrum of investment types to limit risks from large market swings.
In connection with the Company’s merger with Cambridge, the Company acquired Cambridge’s defined benefit plan. The plan was frozen to new participants in 2011 and the accrual of benefits for all participants in the plan was frozen effective in 2017. At the time of the merger, all participants in the plan were fully vested. The Company assumed a $
35.3
 million pension benefit obligation from Cambridge following the merger and, effective December 31, 2024, the acquired plan was merged with the Company’s Defined Benefit Plan. All Cambridge employees retained following the merger were credited with prior service, which counted for vesting and eligibility into the Company’s Defined Benefit Plan, but not for benefit accrual. Additionally, all Cambridge employees retained following the merger were eligible to join the Company’s Defined Benefit Plan to the extent that eligibility requirements were satisfied based upon such employees’ prior service with Cambridge. 
In connection with the sale of its insurance agency business, the Company amended its Defined Benefit Plan to allow for accelerated vesting for any employees of the insurance agency business and several employees of the Bank transitioning to Gallagher who were otherwise not vested in the Defined Benefit Plan at the time of sale.
The Company has a BEP to provide retirement benefits to certain employees whose retirement benefits under the Defined Benefit Plan are limited per the Internal Revenue Code. In connection with the sale of its insurance agency business, the Company amended the BEP to allow for accelerated vesting for all employees of the insurance agency business and several employees of the Bank transitioning to Gallagher who were participating in the BEP and were otherwise not vested in the BEP at the time of sale. In addition, the Company amended the vesting criteria for the BEP to align with that of the Defined Benefit Plan, so that all BEP participants have been credited with service vesting in the same manner and vest according to the same 
three year
 cliff vesting schedule as provided under the Defined Benefit Plan.
The Company has a DB SERP which provides certain retired officers with defined pension benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by U.S. federal tax law. In connection with the Company’s merger with Cambridge, the Company acquired Cambridge’s DB SERP. In 2016, Cambridge’s Board of Directors discontinued the use of DB SERPs for new entrants to Cambridge’s non-qualified retirement programs. Expense for the DB SERPs is recognized over the executive’s service life utilizing the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. All participants of Cambridge’s DB SERP were deemed to be fully vested upon the closing of the merger.
The Company has a ODRCP which provides pension benefits to outside directors who retire from service. Effective December 31, 2020, the Company closed the ODRCP to new participants and froze benefit accruals for active participants.
In connection with the Company’s merger with Cambridge, the Company acquired Cambridge’s post-retirement health care plan (“PHCP”). Benefits for the PHCP are based on years of service. Expenses for the PHCP are recognized over the employee's service life utilizing the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. Effective November 7, 2019, the PHCP was frozen for employees hired after that date. The frozen health care plan is not accruing and is only in payout status.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 section within this Note for further discussion.
In accordance with the Pension Protection Act, the Company was not required to make any contributions to the Defined Benefit Plan for the plan years beginning November 1, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Accordingly, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 contributions to the Defined Benefit Plan. The Company made a discretionary contribution to the Defined Benefit Plan of $
7.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company expects to make 
no
 contribution during the plan year beginning November 1, 2024.
The net actuarial gain of $
15.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the discount rate assumptions used for determining the benefit obligation and higher returns on plan assets than initially expected. The net actuarial loss of $
13.9
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate assumptions used for determining the benefit obligation which was partially offset by higher returns on plan assets than initially expected. The net actuarial gain of $
133.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 
151
was primarily attributable to higher returns on plan assets than initially expected and an increase in the discount rate assumptions which were partially offset by changes in demographic assumptions and in the participant mortality rate assumption.

In general, the Company has selected its assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return based on prevailing yields on high quality fixed income investments increased by a premium for equity return expectations.
To determine the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation and the benefit cost for all of its defined benefit plans, the Company uses the spot rate approach whereby the individual spot rates on the FTSE above-median yield curve are applied to each corresponding year’s projected cash flow used to measure the respective plan’s service cost and interest cost.
Plan Assets
152
The Company owns a percentage of the SBERA defined benefit common collective trust. Based upon this ownership percentage, plan assets managed by SBERA on behalf of the Company amounted to $
545.2
 million and $
468.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investments held by the common collective trust include Level 1, 2 and 3 assets such as: collective funds, equity securities, mutual funds, hedge funds and short-term investments. The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC stipulates that an asset’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the Company classifies its interest in the common collective trust as a Level 3 asset.

Includes service costs related to employees of the Company's insurance agency business for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Such service costs were included in net income from discontinued operations as such costs are no longer incurred by the Company following the sale of the insurance agency business in October 2023. All other costs included in the determination of the benefit obligation for the Defined Benefit Plan and the BEP were included in net income from continuing operations as the Bank assumed the related liability upon dissolution of its Eastern Insurance Group subsidiary. Service costs included in net income from discontinued operations and included in the above table were $
5.1
 million, and $
7.5
 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2023
 and 2022, respectively.
(2)
The pension curtailment gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 was included in discontinued operations. Refer to the below discussion under “Pension Curtailment and Settlement” for further discussion.
Except as indicated above as it relates to service costs included in discontinued operations, service costs for the Defined Benefit Plan, the BEP, and the DB SERP are recognized within salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, as indicated above, the pension curtailment gain is also included in discontinued operations within the gain on sale of discontinued operations. The remaining components of net periodic benefit cost are recognized in 
other noninterest expense
 in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Pension Curtailment and Settlement
As discussed in the earlier
 “Pension Plans”
 section, during the year ended December 31, 2023 and in connection with the sale of its insurance agency business, the Company remeasured the plan assets and obligations of the Defined Benefit 
153
Plan and the obligations of the BEP to determine the resulting curtailment gain or loss. The remeasurement followed the Company’s amendments to to its Defined Benefit Plan and BEP. As a result and in accordance with ASC 715-30,
 “Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans,”
 the Company recognized a curtailment gain upon completion of the sale of the insurance agency business associated with the prior service credits attributable to the employees of the insurance agency business, all of which transferred to Gallagher. The Company determined, with assistance from its actuaries, the amount of the resulting non-cash curtailment amount to be a gain of $
15.9
 million which was included in the gain on sale of the insurance agency business
.
As a practical expedient, ASC 715, 
“Compensation–Retirement Benefits,”
 permits employers to not apply pension plan settlement accounting and to treat settlement transactions as normal benefit payments if the cost of all settlements in the year is less than or equal to the sum of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. The Company has elected this practical expedient.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, lump sum payments from the Defined Benefit Plan exceeded the sum of the service cost and interest cost components (the “threshold”) of the Defined Benefit Plan’s net periodic pension cost. ASC 715-20,
 “Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans,”
 requires that upon determining it is probable that such threshold will be met, an entity shall immediately recognize in earnings a pro rata portion of the aggregate unamortized gain or loss (e.g., “non-cash settlement charge”). In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company elected to apply a practical expedient to remeasure the plan assets and obligations as of the nearest month-end date upon the triggering of the previously mentioned threshold. Accordingly, the Company performed a remeasurement as of October 31, 2022 and, subsequently, as of December 31, 2022. The Company determined, with assistance from its actuaries, the amount of the resulting non-cash settlement charge to be a loss of $
12.0
 million which was recorded in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income
.
Benefits expected to be paid

Employee Tax Deferred Incentive Plan
The Company has an employee tax deferred incentive plan, otherwise known as a 401(k) plan, under which the Company makes voluntary contributions within certain limitations. All employees who meet specified age and length of service requirements are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan. The amount contributed by the Company is included in salaries and employee benefits expense. The amounts contributed to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were $
4.9
 million, $
5.2
 million and $
5.0
 million, respectively.
Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
The Company’s DC SERP, a defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan, allows certain senior officers to earn benefits calculated as a percentage of their compensation. The participant benefits are adjusted based upon a deemed investment performance of measurement funds selected by the participant. These measurement funds are for tracking purposes and are used only to track the performance of a mutual fund, market index, savings instrument, or other designated investment or portfolio of investments. The Company recognized 
no
 expense related to the DC SERP during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company recorded expense related to the DC SERP of $
0.1
 million and $
0.4
 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount due to participants under this plan was included in other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $
23.7
 million and $
20.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans
The Company sponsors 
four
 plans which allow for elective compensation deferrals by directors, former trustees, and certain senior-level employees. Each plan allows its participants to designate deemed investments for deferred amounts from certain options which include diversified choices, such as exchange traded funds and mutual funds. Portfolios with various risk profiles are available to participants with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company purchases and sells investments which track the deemed investment choices, so that it has available funds to meet its payment liabilities. Deferred amounts, adjusted for deemed investment performance, are paid at the time of a participant designated date or event, such as separation from service, death, or disability. The total amounts due to participants under the 
four
 plans were included in other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $
33.3
 million and $
28.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Rabbi Trust Variable Interest Entity
The Company established rabbi trusts to meet its obligations under certain executive non-qualified retirement benefits and deferred compensation plans and to mitigate the expense volatility of the aforementioned retirement plans. The rabbi trusts are considered VIEs as the equity investment at risk is insufficient to permit the trusts to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support from the Company. The Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trusts as it has the power to direct the activities of the rabbi trusts that significantly affect the rabbi trusts’ economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the rabbi trusts that could potentially be significant to the rabbi trusts by virtue of its contingent call options on the rabbi trusts’ assets in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy. As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Company consolidates the rabbi trust investments. In general, the rabbi trust investments and any earnings received thereon are accumulated, reinvested and used exclusively for trust purposes. These rabbi trust investments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government agency obligations, equity securities, mutual funds and other exchange-traded funds, and are recorded at fair value in other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value are recorded in noninterest income.

Share-Based Compensation
Employee Stock Ownership Plan
As part of the IPO completed on October 14, 2020, the Company established a tax-qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plan to provide eligible employees the opportunity to own Company shares. The ESOP borrowed $
149.4
 million from the Company to purchase 
14,940,652
 common shares during the IPO and in the open market. The loan is payable in annual installments over 
30
 years at an interest rate equal to the Prime rate as published in the 
The

Wall Street Journal
. As the loan is repaid to the Company, shares are released and allocated proportionally to eligible participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of compensation relative to the compensation of all participants. The unallocated ESOP shares are pledged as collateral on the loan.
The Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance with FASB ASC 718-40, "
Compensation – Stock Compensation"
. Under this guidance, unreleased shares are deducted from shareholders’ equity as unearned ESOP shares in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of the ESOP shares during the periods in which they are committed to be released. To the extent that the fair value of the Company’s ESOP shares differs from the cost of such shares, the difference is credited or debited to equity. As the loan is internally leveraged, the loan receivable from the ESOP to the Company is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP shown as a liability in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dividends on unallocated shares are used to pay the ESOP debt.
The following table presents the amount of compensation expense associated with the ESOP and the amount of the loan payments made by the ESOP, including the portions related to principal and interest, for the periods indicated:

Share-Based Compensation Plan
On November 29, 2021, the shareholders of the Company approved the Eastern Bankshares, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 
26,146,141
 shares of common stock pursuant to grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, any or all of which can be granted with performance-based vesting conditions. Under the 2021 Plan, 
7,470,326
 shares may be issued as restricted stock or RSUs, including those issued as performance shares and performance share units (“PSUs”), and 
18,675,815
 shares may be issued upon the exercise of stock options. These shares may be awarded from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares. However, the 2021 Plan permits the grant of additional awards of restricted stock or RSUs above the aforementioned limit, provided that, for each additional share of restricted stock or RSU awarded in excess of such limit, the pool of shares available to be issued upon the exercise of stock options will be reduced by 
three
 shares. Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Plan, each of the Company’s non-employee directors were automatically granted awards of restricted 
156
stock on November 30, 2021. Such restricted stock awards vest pro-rata on an annual basis over a 
five-year
 period. The maximum term for stock options is 
ten years
.
In the third quarter of 2024, the Company granted a total of 
146,178
 RSUs to certain executives who joined the Company following the merger with Cambridge. These RSUs vest pro-rata on an annual basis over a period of 
three years
 from the date of grant, subject to continued employment. During that same period, the Company also granted a total of 
67,350
 PSUs, for which vesting is contingent upon the Compensation and Human Capital Management Committee of the Board of Director’s certification, after the conclusion of a period of approximately 
2.3
 years, that the Company has attained a threshold level of certain performance criteria over such period.
On July 12, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Cambridge. In connection with the merger and as a component of the purchase consideration, the Company issued 
118,693
 restricted stock award shares with a fair value of $
1.1
 million, net of a $
0.7
 million post-combination fair value adjustment, and, with respect to RSUs and PSUs, credited pre-merger service for employees retained following the merger with Cambridge which amounted to $
3.0
 million.
In May 2024 the Company granted a total of 
56,352
 shares of restricted stock to the Company’s non-employee directors which vest after approximately 
one year
 from the date of grant. In May 2023 the Company granted a total of 
47,820
 shares of restricted stock to the Company’s non-employee directors which vest after approximately 
one year
 from the date of grant.
In March 2024, the Company granted to all of the Company’s executive officers and certain other employees a total of 
416,276
 RSUs, which vest pro-rata on an annual basis over a period of 
three years
 from the date of the grant, and a total of 
234,091
 PSUs for which vesting is contingent upon the Compensation and Human Capital Management Committee of the Board of Director’s certification, after the conclusion of a period of approximately 
2.8
 years from the date of the grant, that the Company has attained a threshold level of certain performance criteria over such period. In March 2023, the Company granted to all of the Company’s executive officers and certain other employees a total of 
318,577
 RSUs, which vest pro-rata on an annual basis over a period of 
three years
 from the date of the grant, and a total of 
108,984
 PSUs for which vesting is contingent upon the Compensation and Human Capital Management Committee of the Board of Director’s certification, after the conclusion of a 
three-year
 period from the date of the grant, that the Company has attained a threshold level of certain performance criteria over such period.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
3,844,157
 shares and 
4,872,494
 shares that remained available for issuance as restricted stock or RSU awards (including those that may be issued as performance shares and PSUs), respectively, and 
18,675,815
 shares that remained available for issuance upon the exercise of stock options at both dates. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
no
 stock options had been awarded under the 2021 Plan.

Commitments and Contingencies
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
In order to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and forward commitments to sell loans, all of which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in each particular class of financial instruments.
Substantially all of the Company’s commitments to extend credit, which normally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of agreement with the third party, the Company would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. For forward loan sale commitments, the contract or notional amount does not represent exposure to credit loss. The Company generally does not sell loans with recourse.
The following table summarizes the above financial instruments as of the dates indicated:

Other Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company has been named a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based on the advice of legal counsel, the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
18. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk resulting from the differences in the amount, timing, and duration of known or expected cash receipts and known or expected cash payments. Additionally, the Company enters into interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts to accommodate the business requirements of its customers (“customer-related positions”) and risk participation agreements entered into as financial guarantees of performance on customer-related interest rate swap derivatives. The Company also enters into residential mortgage loan commitments to fund mortgage loans at specified rates and times in the future and enters into forward sale commitments to sell such residential mortgage loans at specified prices and times in the future, both of which are considered derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not the instrument qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes, and further, by the type of hedging relationship. 
By using derivatives, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Company’s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all swaps with each counterparty plus any initial margin collateral posted. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with those counterparties is remote. The Company’s discounting methodology and interest calculation of cash margin uses the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, for U.S. dollar cleared interest rate swaps.
159
Interest Rate Positions
An interest rate swap is an agreement whereby one party agrees to pay a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount in exchange for receiving a fixed rate of interest on the same notional amount, for a predetermined period of time, from a second party. The amounts relating to the notional principal amount are not actually exchanged. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps in which it pays floating and receives fixed interest in order to manage its interest rate risk exposure to the variability in interest cash flows on certain floating-rate loans. Such interest rate swaps include those which effectively convert the floating rate one-month SOFR or overnight indexed swap rate, or prime rate interest payments received on the loans to a fixed rate and consequently reduce the Company’s exposure to variability in short-term interest rates. For interest rate swaps that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are included in other comprehensive income and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects net income. 
The following tables reflect the Company’s derivative positions for interest rate swaps which qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes as of the dates indicated:

The maximum amount of time over which the Company is currently hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of forecasted transactions related to the receipt of variable interest on existing financial instruments is 
2.7
 years.
The Company expects approximately $
24.7
 million will be reclassified into interest income, as a reduction of such income, from other comprehensive income related to the Company’s active cash flow hedges in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2024. The reclassification is due to anticipated net payments on the swaps based upon the forward curve as of December 31, 2024.
The Company discontinues cash flow hedge accounting if it is probable that the forecasted hedged transactions will not occur in the initially identified time period. At such time, the associated gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) are reclassified immediately into earnings and any subsequent changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
The following table presents the pre-tax impact of terminated cash flow hedges on AOCI for the periods indicated:

Customer-Related Positions
Interest rate swaps offered to commercial customers do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. These swaps allow the Company to retain variable rate commercial loans while allowing the commercial customer to synthetically fix the loan rate by entering into a variable-to-fixed rate interest rate swap. The Company believes that its exposure to commercial customer derivatives is limited to non-performance by either the customer or the dealer because these contracts are simultaneously matched at inception with an offsetting transaction.
Risk participation agreements are entered into as financial guarantees of performance on interest rate swap derivatives. The purchased (asset) or sold (liability) guarantee allow the Company to participate-out (fee paid) or participate-in (fee received) the risk associated with certain derivative positions executed with the borrower by the lead bank in a customer-related interest rate swap derivative.
Foreign exchange contracts consist of those offered to commercial customers and those entered into to hedge the Company’s foreign currency risk associated with a foreign-currency loan. Neither qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes. These commercial customer derivatives are offset with matching derivatives with correspondent-bank counterparties in order to minimize foreign exchange rate risk to the Company. Exposure with respect to these derivatives is largely limited to non-performance by either the customer or the other counterparty. Neither the Company nor the correspondent-bank counterparty are required to post collateral but each has established foreign-currency transaction limits to manage the exposure risk. The Company requires its customers to post collateral to minimize risk exposure.

The Company has agreements with its customer-related interest rate swap derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
162
The Company also has agreements with certain of its customer-related interest rate swap derivative correspondent-bank counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.
The Company’s exposure related to its customer-related interest rate swap derivatives consists of exposure on cleared derivative transactions and exposure on non-cleared derivative transactions.
Cleared derivative transactions are with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, and exposure is settled to market daily, with additional credit exposure related to initial-margin collateral pledged to CME at trade execution. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had exposure to CME for settled variation margin in excess of the customer-related and non-customer-related interest rate swap termination values of $
0.1
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had posted initial-margin collateral in the form of U.S. Treasury notes amounting to $
88.0
 million and $
85.9
 million, respectively, to CME for these derivatives. The U.S. Treasury notes were considered restricted assets and were included in available for sale securities within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At December 31, 2024 there were 
no
 customer-related interest rate swap derivatives with credit-risk contingent features in a net liability position. At December 31, 2023, there were $
1.9
 million of customer-related interest rate swap derivatives with credit-risk contingent features in a net liability position. The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with its customer-related interest rate swap derivative correspondent-bank counterparties to the extent that the Company has a liability position with the correspondent-bank counterparties. The Company was 
not
 required to post cash collateral for interest rate swaps with correspondent-bank counterparties as of December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company had posted collateral in the form of cash amounting to $
3.0
 million, which was considered to be a restricted asset and was included in other short-term investments within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2024 or 2023, it would have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value. In addition, the Company had cross-default provisions with its commercial customer loan agreements which provide cross-collateralization with the customer loan collateral.
Mortgage Banking Derivatives
The Company enters into residential mortgage loan commitments in connection with its consumer mortgage banking activities to fund mortgage loans at specified rates and times in the future. In addition, the Company enters into forward sale commitments to sell such residential mortgage loans at specified prices and times in the future. These commitments are short-term in nature and generally expire in 30 to 60 days. The residential mortgage loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale and the related forward sale commitments are considered derivative instruments under ASC Topic 815,
 “Derivatives and Hedging”
 and are reported at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported in earnings and included in 
other non-interest income
 on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an outstanding notional balance of residential mortgage loan origination commitments of $
15.7
 million and $
10.5
 million, respectively, and forward sale commitments of $
6.4
 million and $
9.2
 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net gains/losses recorded by the Company related to the change in fair value of commitments to originate and sell mortgage loans were not significant. In addition, the aggregate fair value of the Company’s mortgage banking derivative asset and liability as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not significant. Mortgage banking derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Residential mortgages sold are generally sold with servicing rights released. Mortgage banking derivatives do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.
19. 
Balance Sheet Offsetting
Certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. The Company’s derivative transactions with upstream financial institution counterparties are generally executed under International Swaps and Derivative Association master agreements which include “right of set-off” provisions. In such cases there is generally a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts. However, the Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments. The Company nets the amount recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral against the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Collateral legally required to be maintained at dealer banks by the Company is monitored and adjusted as necessary. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, it was determined that no additional collateral would have to be posted to immediately settle these instruments.
163

20. 
Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

The Company uses fair value measurements to record adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.
Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no active market exists for a portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.
165
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair value disclosures:
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For these financial instruments, which have original maturities of 
90
 days or less, their carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value.
Securities
Securities consisted of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Agency bonds, U.S. government-sponsored residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal bonds. AFS securities are recorded at fair value.
The Company’s U.S. Treasury securities are traded on active markets and therefore these securities were classified as Level 1.
The fair value of U.S. Agency bonds were evaluated using relevant trade data, benchmark quotes and spreads obtained from publicly available trade data, and generated on a price, yield or spread basis as determined by the observed market data. Therefore, these securities were categorized as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs.
The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities were estimated using either a matrix or benchmarks. The inputs used include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. Therefore, these securities were categorized as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs.
The fair value of state and municipal bonds were estimated using a valuation matrix with inputs including observable bond interest rate tables, recent transactions, and yield relationships. Therefore, these securities were categorized as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs.
Fair value was based on the value of one unit without regard to any premium or discount that may result from concentrations of ownership of a financial instrument, possible tax ramifications, or estimated transaction costs.
Loans Held for Sale
The fair value of loans held for sale, whose carrying amounts approximate fair value, was estimated using the anticipated market price based upon pricing indications provided by investor banks. These assets were classified as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs. 
Loans
The fair value of commercial construction, commercial and industrial lines of credit, and certain other consumer loans was estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.
For commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate, automobile, and consumer home equity loans, fair value was estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment estimates using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. 
Loans are classified as Level 3 since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs. Loans that are deemed to be collateral-dependent, as described in 
Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”
 were recorded at the fair value of the underlying collateral.
FHLB Stock
The fair value of FHLB stock approximates the carrying amount based on the redemption provisions of the FHLB. These assets were classified as Level 2.
Rabbi Trust and Deferred Compensation Plan Investments
Rabbi trust and deferred compensation plan investments consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government agency obligations, equity securities, mutual funds and other exchange-traded funds, and were recorded at fair value and included in other assets. The purpose of these investments is to fund certain executive non-qualified retirement benefits and deferred compensation.
166
The fair value of other U.S. government agency obligations were estimated using either a matrix or benchmarks. The inputs used include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. These securities were categorized as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs. The equity securities, mutual funds and other exchange-traded funds were valued based on quoted prices from the market. The equities, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds traded in an active market were categorized as Level 1 as they were valued based upon quoted prices from the market. Mutual funds at net asset value amounted to $
54.1
 million and $
48.9
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no redemption restrictions on these mutual funds at the end of any period presented.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance
The fair value of bank-owned life insurance was based upon quotations received from bank-owned life insurance dealers. These assets were classified as Level 2 given the use of observable inputs.
Deposits
The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings, interest checking accounts, and money market accounts, was equal to their carrying amount. The fair value of time deposits was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows using current market interest rates. Deposits were classified as Level 2 given the use of observable market inputs.
The fair value estimates of deposits do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the wholesale market (core deposit intangibles). 
FHLB Advances
The fair value of FHLB advances was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rates used are representative of approximate rates currently offered on instruments with similar remaining maturities. FHLB advances were classified as Level 2.
Escrow Deposits of Borrowers
The fair value of escrow deposits of borrowers, which have no stated maturity, approximates the carrying amount. Escrow deposits of borrowers were classified as Level 2.
Interest Rate Swap Collateral Funds
The fair value of interest rate swap collateral funds approximates the carrying amount. Interest rate swap collateral funds were classified as Level 2.
Interest Rate Swaps
The fair value of interest rate swaps was determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the interest rate swaps. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate swaps, including the period of maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatility. In addition, for customer-related interest rate swaps, the analysis reflects a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the Company’s own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty’s non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. The majority of inputs used to value the Company’s interest rate swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but the credit valuation adjustments associated with the interest rate swaps utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. However, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact of the Level 3 inputs on the overall valuation of the interest rate swaps was deemed insignificant to the overall valuation. As a result, the interest rate swaps were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Risk Participations
The fair value of risk participations was determined based upon the total expected exposure of the derivative which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using market-based inputs and were therefore categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value also included a credit valuation adjustment which evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties by considering factors such as the likelihood of default by the counterparties, its net exposures, the remaining contractual life, as well as the amount of collateral securing the position. The change in value of derivative assets and liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during the reported periods.
167
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts were based upon the remaining expiration period of the contracts and bid quotations received from foreign exchange contract dealers and were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Mortgage Derivatives
The fair value of mortgage derivatives was determined based upon current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market and therefore are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis

For the valuation of the collateral-dependent loans, the Company relies primarily on third-party valuation information from certified appraisers, and values are generally based upon recent appraisals of the underlying collateral, brokers’ opinions based upon recent sales of comparable properties, estimated equipment auction or liquidation values, income capitalization, or a combination of income capitalization and comparable sales. Depending on the type of underlying collateral, valuations may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic factors and estimated liquidation expenses. The range of these possible adjustments may vary.

This summary excludes certain financial assets and liabilities for which the carrying value approximates fair value. For financial assets, these may include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term investments. For financial liabilities, these may include federal funds purchased. These instruments would all be considered to be classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Also excluded from the summary are financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis, as previously described.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”) is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The Company considers the terms of the contract and all relevant facts and circumstances when applying this guidance. The Company measures revenue and timing of recognition by applying the following five steps:
1.
Identify the contract(s) with the customers.
2.
Identify the performance obligations.
3.
Determine the transaction price.
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.
5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
The information presented within this Note excludes discontinued operations with respect to the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to 
Note 23, “Discontinued Operations”
 for further discussion regarding discontinued operations.
Performance obligations
The Company’s performance obligations are generally satisfied either at a point in time or over time, as services are rendered. Unsatisfied performance obligations at the report date are not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
A portion of the Company’s noninterest income/(loss) is derived from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606. The Company has disaggregated such revenues by type of service, as presented in the table below. These categories reflect how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Additional information related to each of the revenue streams is further noted below. 
Trust and Investment Advisory Fees
The Company offers investment management and trust services to individuals, institutions, small businesses and charitable institutions. Each investment management product is governed by its own contract along with a separate identifiable fee schedule unique to that product. The Company also offers additional services, such as estate settlement, financial planning, tax services, and other special services quoted at the customer’s request.
The asset management and/or custody fees are primarily based upon a percentage of the monthly valuation of the principal assets in the customer’s account. Customers are also charged a base fee which is prorated over a twelve-month period. Fees for additional or special services are generally fixed in nature and are charged as services are rendered. All revenue is recognized in correlation to the monthly management fee determinations or as transactional services are provided. Trust and advisory fees earned but not yet received amounted to $
5.7
 million and $
0.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
172
Deposit Service Charges
The Company offers various deposit account products to its customers governed by specific deposit agreements applicable to either personal customers or business customers. These agreements identify the general conditions and obligations of both parties and include standard information regarding deposit account-related fees.
Deposit account services include providing access to deposit accounts as well as access to the various deposit transactional services of the Company. These transactional services are primarily those that are identified in the standard fee schedule, and include, but are not limited to, services such as overdraft protection, wire transfer, and check collection. The Company may charge monthly fixed service fees associated with the customer having access to the deposit account as well as separate fixed fees associated with and at the time specific transactions are entered into by the customer. As such, the Company considers that its performance obligations are fulfilled when customers are provided deposit account access or when the requested deposit transaction is completed.
Cash management services are a subset of the deposit service charges revenue stream. These services include automated clearing house, or ACH, transaction processing, positive pay, lockbox, and remote deposit services. These services are also governed by separate agreements entered into by the customer. The fee arrangement for these services is structured as a fixed fee per transaction which may be offset by earnings credits. An earnings credit is a discount that a customer receives based upon the investable balance in the applicable covered deposit account(s) for a given month. Earnings credits are only good for the given month. That is, if cash management fees for a given month are less than the month’s earnings credit, the remainder of the credit does not carry over to the following month. Cash management fees are recognized as revenue in the month that the services are provided. Cash management fees earned but not yet received amounted to $
1.6
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, and were included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Debit Card Processing Fees
The Company provides debit cards to its customers which are authorized and settled through various card payment networks, and in exchange, the Company earns revenue as determined by each payment network’s interchange program. Regardless of the network that is utilized to authorize and settle the payment, the merchant that provides the product or service to the debit card holder is ultimately responsible for the interchange payment to the Company. Debit card processing fees are recognized as card transactions are settled within each network. Debit card processing fees earned but not yet received amounted to $
0.4
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, and were included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Other Noninterest Income
The Company earns various types of other noninterest income that have been aggregated into one general revenue stream in the table noted above. Noninterest income in-scope of ASC 606 includes, but is not limited to, the following types of revenue with customers: safe deposit rent, ATM surcharge fees and customer checkbook fees. Individually, these sources of noninterest income are not material.

Discontinued Operations
On September 19, 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into an asset purchase agreement (“the agreement”) with Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (“Gallagher”) to sell substantially all of the assets of its insurance agency business for a gross purchase price of $
515.0
 million. The agreement also provided for the assumption of certain liabilities of the insurance agency business by Gallagher. Management made the decision to sell certain assets of its insurance agency business to recognize the valuation premium of the business, while allowing the Company to focus on growth and strategic initiatives of its core banking business.
In September 2023, following the approval of the sale by the Company’s board of directors, the Company reclassified substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its insurance agency business as held for sale in connection with a planned disposition of the business. A business is classified as held for sale when management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and certain other criteria are met. In accordance with 
ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements
, the Company classifies operations as discontinued when they meet all the criteria to be classified as held for sale and when the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
On October 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its insurance agency business for net cash consideration at closing of $
498.1
 million, subject to customary post-closing working capital adjustments. The net cash proceeds at closing included the gross purchase price pursuant to the agreement of $
515.0
 million and an estimated working capital adjustment of $
4.2
 million, which were reduced by transaction expenses of $
17.0
 million and the settlement of certain obligations of the Company primarily related to employee post-retirement liabilities that originated prior to closing of $
4.1
 million. In addition, the Company transferred $
7.4
 million in fiduciary cash to Gallagher upon closing which is included in the determination of the gain on sale as of December 31, 2023 but was not included in the amount of net cash consideration of $
498.1
 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recognized a gain on sale of $
408.6
 million, which was subject to certain post-closing adjustments during the 120 day post-closing settlement period which ended on February 28, 2024. The amount of the post-
176
closing settlement was not material. In addition, the Company recognized indirect noninterest expenses associated with the sale of approximately $
22.3
 million.

, associated with certain employee post-retirement benefit plan expenses.

(4)
Includes intercompany expenses and other credits associated with the Defined Benefit Plan and the BEP. Components of net periodic benefit cost associated with the Defined Benefit Plan and the BEP included in other noninterest expense above were a net credit for the periods presented.
Continuing Involvement
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to provide certain transitional services to Gallagher for up to 
six months
 following the closing of the sale. Such services included certain information and technology support and human resources support. The Company was compensated for such services on a monthly basis, and the total compensation over the 
six month
 period plus reimbursement of amounts paid by the Company in connection with its performance of the transitional services was not material.
Leases
During the year ended December 31, 2023, upon reclassification of the above assets and liabilities to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, the Company re-assessed the ROU assets of certain leases, which were assumed by Gallagher upon closing, and made the decision to abandon certain leases which were not assumed by Gallagher and for which Eastern Insurance Group was the lessee. The Company retained one lease for which Eastern Insurance Group was lessee at the time of closing. Following the sale, the lease was partially sublet to Gallagher and Eastern Insurance Group’s obligation was transferred to the Bank upon dissolution of Eastern Insurance Group. As of December 31, 2023, the ROU asset and lease liability for such lease was $
0.5
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company remeasured the present value of the future lease payments related to each lease for which Eastern Insurance Group was the lessee which resulted in a net reduction of the lease liabilities and a corresponding net reduction of the lease ROU assets of $
6.4
 million. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $
2.0
 million related to leases which were terminated early following the closing of the asset sale. The impairment charge was included in net income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Revenue Recognition - Insurance Commissions
The Company acted as an agent in offering property, casualty, and life and health insurance to both commercial and consumer customers though Eastern Insurance Group. The Company also earned additional commissions from the insurers based upon meeting certain criteria, such as premium levels, growth rates, new business volume and loss experience. The Company recognized commission revenues when earned based upon the effective date of the policy or when services were rendered. Certain revenues were deferred to reflect delivery of services over the contract period. Upon the transfer of Eastern Insurance Group’s assets to Gallagher, which occurred on October 31, 2023, the Company ceased to offer insurance products and services and thus no longer receives insurance-related commissions and revenues. The Company earned a fixed commission rate on the sales of these products and services.
Commissions were earned on the contract effective date and generally were based upon a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage. Commission rates depended upon a large number of factors, including the type of risk being placed, the particular underwriting enterprise’s demand, the expected loss experience of the particular risk coverage, and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for the Company to place and service the insurance contract. The vast majority of the Company’s services and revenues were associated with the placement of an insurance contract.
The Company also earned profit-sharing revenues, also referred to as contingency revenue, from the insurers with whom the Company placed business. These profit-sharing revenues were performance bonuses from the insurers based upon certain performance metrics such as floors on written premiums, loss rates, and growth rates. These amounts were in excess of the commission revenues discussed above, and not all business placed with underwriting enterprises was eligible for contingent revenues. Contingent revenues were variable and generally based upon the Company’s expectation of the ultimate profit-sharing revenue amounts to be earned and varied from period to period. The Company’s contracts were generally calendar year contracts whereby revenues from underwriting enterprises were received in the calendar year following placement, generally the first and second quarters, after verification of the performance indicators outlined in the contracts. Accordingly, during each reporting period, management made its best estimate of the amounts that had been earned using historical averages and other factors to project revenues. The Company based its estimates each period on a contract-by-contract basis. As estimates could have changed significantly from period to period, the Company did not recognize this revenue until it had concluded that, based upon all the facts and information available, it was probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in a future period.

Segment Reporting
An operating segment is defined as a component of a business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. The Company has determined that its CODM is its Executive Chair. The Company has 
one
 reportable segment: its banking business, which consists of a full range of banking lending, savings, and small business offerings, and its wealth management and trust operations. The CODM makes operating and resource allocation decisions based upon the results of the Company’s core banking business. The core banking business, which is comprised of the commercial group, consumer group, and wealth management components, is managed by the Company’s Executive Chair and resource allocation decisions are made by the CODM as a single operating segment rather than at the individual component level. Each of these components are conducted and financed through banking activities and operations. The core banking business activities are interrelated and viewed by management as a single operating segment.
The accounting policies of the banking business segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The CODM assesses performance of the banking business segment and decides how to allocate resources based upon net income that is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income as net income (loss) from continuing operations. The measure of segment assets is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as total assets. The CODM uses net income to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the banking business segment or into other parts of the Company, such as for acquisitions, to pay dividends, or to repurchase outstanding shares. Net income is used to monitor budget versus actual results. The CODM also uses net income in competitive analysis by benchmarking to the Company’s competitors. The competitive analysis along with the monitoring of budgeted versus actual results are used in assessing performance of the segment and in establishing management’s compensation. The Company does not have intra-entity sales.
The CODM uses consolidated profit and loss measures which are presented on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Therefore, refer to the Consolidated Statements of Income for quantitative information regarding the 
181
banking business segment operating results. The segment operating results include certain other segment items which are included in other noninterest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Significant expense items included in the other noninterest expense line include operational losses, which are primarily comprised of debit card and bad check losses, liability insurance expense, and other loan expenses, which are primarily comprised of legal collection fees and certain origination and servicing-related expenses. The CODM reviews such amounts as a whole in their review of segment operating results.
28. 
Subsequent Event
Subsequent to December 31, 2024, management made the decision to sell certain available for sale securities, which were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024, in connection with an investment portfolio repositioning. In January and February 2025, available for sale securities with a book value of $
1.6
 billion were sold for proceeds of $
1.3
 billion which resulted in the recognition of a realized loss on sale of approximately $
270.0
 million. Management reinvested the sale proceeds into available for sale securities at current market interest rates.
ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer along with the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer along with the Company’s Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has not experienced any material impact to the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting due to the fact that most of the Company’s employees responsible for financial reporting are working remotely and/or hybrid. The Company is continually monitoring and assessing the impact of working remotely and/or hybrid on the Company’s internal controls to minimize the impact to their design and operating effectiveness.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of Eastern Bankshares, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
182
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eastern Bankshares, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Eastern Bankshares, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Eastern Bankshares, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
