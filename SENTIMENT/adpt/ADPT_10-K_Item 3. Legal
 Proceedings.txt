Overview

We are advancing the field of immune medicine by harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature’s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our immune medicine platform applies our proprietary technologies to read the diverse genetic code of a patient’s immune system and understand precisely how the immune system detects and treats disease in that patient. We capture these insights in our dynamic clinical immunomics database and related antigen annotations, which are underpinned by computational biology and machine learning, and use them to develop and commercialize clinical products and services that can be tailored to the needs of individual patients. Our existing and future commercial products and services are aligned to two business areas which we refer to as MRD and Immune Medicine.

Our current product and service offerings in MRD related to the MRD market are our clonoSEQ clinical diagnostic test, offered to clinicians, and our clonoSEQ or MRD assay, offered to biopharmaceutical partners to advance drug development efforts. Our first clinical diagnostic product, clonoSEQ, is the first test authorized by the FDA for the detection and monitoring of MRD in patients with MM, B cell ALL and CLL, and is also available as a CLIA-validated laboratory developed test for patients with other lymphoid cancers, including DLBCL and MCL. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we obtained Medicare coverage for MCL and initiated promotional efforts in MCL. We also recently obtained a new Medicare CLFS rate of $2,007 per test for clonoSEQ and MolDX updated the clonoSEQ episode pricing to $8,029 for all covered indications. This represents a 17% increase from the previous episode price and the previous implied per test rate under the episode structure. With the use of clonoSEQ, we are transforming how lymphoid cancers are treated by working with providers, pharmaceutical partners and payors. In an effort to enable easier test ordering, we have worked to integrate the clonoSEQ clinical diagnostic test via Epic's comprehensive EMR system into the records systems of numerous accounts, and continue to make more progress.

Immune Medicine leverages our proprietary ability to sequence, map, pair and characterize TCRs and BCRs at scale to drive opportunities in cancer and autoimmune disorders. Our immunosequencing technology, which includes our Adaptive Immunosequencing research product, serves as the research and development engine driving our immune medicine platform and generates revenue from biopharmaceutical and academic customers. We are applying AI and machine learning models to map at scale TCR sequences to the diseases they bind to enable our drug discovery efforts. Also in our drug discovery programs, we use our proprietary capabilities to discover new drug targets and leverage our validated TCR and BCR discovery approaches to discover and develop TCR or antibody therapeutic assets. Our drug discovery efforts include the Genentech Agreement under which we support Genentech in the development of cancer antigen-directed TCR-based cancer cell therapies for the treatment of patients with solid tumors.

We recognized revenue of $179.0 million and $170.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation was $159.5 million and $225.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock, including the sale of common stock in our initial public offering and follow-on offering, and, to a lesser extent, revenue and proceeds from the Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $256.0 million and $346.4 million, respectively.

74

Restructurings

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we implemented various restructuring plans which better aligned our organization to our two operating segments, impacted certain planned software enhancements and resulted in the consolidation of certain research and development workflows, among other things. The software enhancements were primarily associated with our laboratory information management systems. As part of these restructurings, we reduced our workforce, had long-lived assets that were no longer being utilized and vacated certain leased space in South San Francisco, California. In total, we recognized $9.2 million of restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2024. Of the $9.2 million restructuring costs recognized, $7.2 million related to impairment charges. The activities related to these restructurings were completed as of December 31, 2024. See Note 15, 
Restructurings 
of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our restructuring expenses.

Segment Information

In 2024, in connection with an organizational realignment, we began operating our business as two reportable segments: MRD and Immune Medicine. These segments are organized by market opportunity in commercial diagnostics and drug discovery, respectively. See Note 19, 
Segment Information 
of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our segments and the assumptions used to allocate shared expenses.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

We derive revenue by providing diagnostic and research services in our MRD and Immune Medicine business areas. Our MRD revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing our clonoSEQ report to clinical customers; (2) providing MRD sample testing services to biopharmaceutical customers and certain academic institutions, including investigator-led clinical trials; and (3) providing our clonoSEQ report or results to certain international laboratory sites through technology transfers. We disclose our clonoSEQ test volume, which includes the number of clonoSEQ reports and results we have provided to ordering physicians in the U.S. and international technology transfer sites. These volumes do not include sample results from our biopharmaceutical customers or academic institutions utilizing our MRD services. Our Immune Medicine revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing sample testing services for our commercial research product, Adaptive Immunosequencing, to biopharmaceutical customers and academic institutions; (2) our collaboration agreements with Genentech and other biopharmaceutical customers in areas of drug and target discovery; and (3) for years prior to 2023, providing our T-Detect COVID tests to clinical customers.

For our clinical customers, we primarily derive revenue from providing our clonoSEQ report to ordering physicians. We bill commercial, government and medical institution payors based on reports delivered to ordering physicians. Amounts paid for clonoSEQ by commercial, government and medical institution payors vary based on respective reimbursement rates and patient responsibilities, which may differ from our targeted list price. We recognize clinical revenue by evaluating customer payment history, contracted reimbursement rates, if applicable, and other adjustments to estimate the amount of revenue that is collectible.

For our clonoSEQ coverage under Medicare, we bill an episode of treatment when we deliver the first eligible test report. This billing contemplates all necessary tests required during a patient’s treatment cycle, which is currently estimated at approximately four tests per patient, including the initial sequence identification test. Revenue recognition commences at the time the initial billable test report is delivered and is based upon cumulative tests delivered to date. Any unrecognized revenue from the initial billable test is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized either as we deliver our estimate of the remaining tests in a patient’s treatment cycle or when the likelihood becomes remote that a patient will receive additional testing.

For our research customers, which include biopharmaceutical customers and academic institutions for both our MRD and Adaptive Immunosequencing services, delivery of the respective test results may include some level of professional support and analysis. Terms with biopharmaceutical customers generally include non-refundable payments made in advance of services (“upfront payments”), which we record as deferred revenue. For all research customers, we recognize revenue as we deliver sequencing results. From time to time, we offer discounts in order to gain rights and access to certain datasets. Revenue is recognized net of these discounts and costs associated with these services are reflected in cost of revenue. In periods where our sample estimates are reduced or a customer project is cancelled and, in either case, we have remaining related deferred revenue, we recognize revenue using a cumulative catch-up approach based on the proportion of samples delivered to date relative to the total samples expected to be delivered. Certain of our MRD revenue arrangements with biopharmaceutical customers include cash consideration from the achievement of regulatory milestones of the respective biopharmaceutical customers’ therapeutics. Such revenue is constrained from recognition until it becomes probable that such milestone will be achieved.

75

Under certain agreements with our biopharmaceutical customers who seek access to our platform to support their therapeutic development activities, revenues are generated from research and development support services that we provide. These agreements may include substantial non-refundable upfront payments, which we recognize over time as we perform the respective services. Revenue recognized from these activities relate primarily to the Genentech Agreement.

We expect our MRD revenue to increase in the long term as we continue to increase our MRD clinical testing volume through enhanced penetration in our existing covered patient populations, expand into new patient populations and optimize payor coverage. Our MRD revenue may fluctuate period to period due to the uncertain timing of receipt of our biopharmaceutical customer samples, which may cause uncertainty in the delivery of our products and services, the recognition of milestones related to regulatory approvals of our biopharmaceutical customers’ therapeutics and changes in estimates of our clinical revenue reimbursement rates.

We expect our Immune Medicine revenue to increase in the long term as we or our collaborators advance therapies to commercialization. Our Immune Medicine revenue may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of expenses incurred, changes in estimates of total anticipated costs related to the Genentech Agreement and other events not within our control, including the recognition of milestones under the Genentech Agreement and the timing of receipt of customer samples from our biopharmaceutical customers.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes the cost of materials, personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), shipping and handling expenses, equipment costs, allocated facility costs associated with processing samples and professional support costs related to our service revenue activities. Allocated facility costs include depreciation of laboratory equipment, as well as allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. Costs associated with processing samples are recorded as expense, regardless of the timing of revenue recognition. As such, cost of revenue and related volume does not always trend in the same direction as revenue recognition and related volume. Additionally, costs to support the Genentech Agreement are a component of our research and development expenses.

We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in the long term as we grow our sample testing volume, but the cost per sample to decrease over the long term due to the efficiencies we may gain as assay volume increases from improved utilization of our laboratory capacity, automation and other value engineering initiatives. If our sample volume throughput is reduced, cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue may be adversely impacted due to fixed overhead costs.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist of laboratory materials costs, personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), equipment costs, allocated facility and information technology costs and contract service expenses. Research and development activities support further development and refinement of existing assays and products, discovery of new technologies and investments in our immune medicine platform. We also include in research and development expenses the costs associated with software development of applications to support future commercial opportunities, as well as development activities to support laboratory scaling and workflow. We are currently conducting research and development activities for several products and services and we typically use our laboratory materials, personnel, facilities, information technology and other development resources across multiple development programs. Additionally, certain of these research and development activities benefit more than one of our product opportunities. We have not historically tracked research and development expenses by specific product candidates.

The costs to support the Genentech Agreement are a component of our research and development expenses. Additionally, a component of our research and development expenses are costs supporting clinical and analytical validations to obtain regulatory approval for future clinical products and services. Some of these activities have generated and may in the future generate revenue.

We expect research and development expenses to decrease in the short term and to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our development and commercialization efforts.

Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses include personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation) for commercial sales, product and account management, marketing, reimbursement, medical education and business development personnel that support commercialization of our platform products. In addition, these expenses include external costs such as advertising expenses, customer education and promotional expenses, market analysis expenses, conference fees, travel expenses and allocated facility and information technology costs.

76

We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the short term. In the long term, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we increase marketing activities to drive awareness and adoption of our products and services. However, we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, subject to fluctuations from period to period due to the timing and magnitude of these expenses.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses include personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation) for our personnel in executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and other administrative functions, including third-party clinical billing services. In addition, these expenses include insurance costs, external legal costs, accounting and tax service expenses, consulting fees and allocated facility and information technology costs.

We expect general and administrative expenses to moderately increase in the short term and to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Expenses

Impairment of long-lived assets expenses include our impairment charges for certain leased office and laboratory space, related long-lived assets (including leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment) and long-lived assets associated with our halted software enhancements. See Note 10, 
Leases
 and Note 15, 
Restructurings
 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding our impairment assessments and considerations.

Interest Expense

Interest expense includes costs associated with our revenue interest liability related to the Purchase Agreement and noncash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related deferred issuance costs. We impute interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We calculate an effective interest rate which will amortize our related obligation to zero over the anticipated repayment period. A significant increase or decrease in or changes in timing of forecasted revenue will prospectively impact our interest expense.

The $42.8 million increase in MRD revenue was primarily due to a $26.3 million increase in revenue generated from providing clonoSEQ to clinical customers, a $12.5 million increase in revenue recognized upon the achievement of regulatory milestones by certain of our biopharmaceutical customers, and a $5.8 million increase in revenue generated from providing MRD sample testing services to biopharmaceutical customers. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in revenue generated from providing MRD sample testing services to investigator-led clinical trials. Our clonoSEQ test volume increased by 35% to 76,105 tests delivered in the year ended December 31, 2024 from 56,496 tests delivered in the year ended December 31, 2023.

The $34.1 million decrease in Immune Medicine revenue was primarily due to a $29.1 million decrease in revenue generated from the Genentech Agreement, which resulted from decreased collaboration expenses and decreased revenue recognized from the $10.0 million regulatory milestone achieved in May 2023, and a $5.0 million decrease in revenue generated from our biopharmaceutical and academic customers.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation adjusted for interest and other income, net, interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment costs for long-lived assets, restructuring expense and share-based compensation expense. We define our segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same way to the extent the net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation and adjustments are allocable to each segment. See Note 19, 
Segment Information 
of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding segment Adjusted EBITDA.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate the financial performance of our business and segments and to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies. We present these figures because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry and it facilitates comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes items that are not indicative of our core operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We may in the future incur expenses similar to the adjustments we make. In particular, we expect to incur meaningful share-based compensation expense in the future. Other limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, does not reflect:

•
all expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

•
changes in our working capital needs;

•
interest expense, which is an ongoing element of our costs to operate;

•
income tax (expense) benefit, which may be a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate;

•
the costs of replacing the assets being depreciated and amortized, which will often have to be replaced in the future;

•
the noncash component of employee compensation expense;

•
long-lived assets impairment costs; and

•
the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations, such as our restructuring activities and reductions in workforce.

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have incurred losses since inception and have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception through the year ended December 31, 2018, and again in the years ended December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion.

We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock, and, to a lesser extent, revenue and proceeds from the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement entered into in September 2022, we received net cash proceeds of $124.4 million, after deducting issuance costs. We are also entitled to receive up to $125.0 million in subsequent installments as follows: (i) $75.0 million upon our request occurring no later than September 12, 2025 and (ii) $50.0 million upon our request in connection with certain permitted acquisitions occurring no later than September 12, 2025, in each case subject to certain funding conditions. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $256.0 million.

We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. We may consider raising additional capital to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons.

If our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and anticipated cash flows are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may request an additional installment under the Purchase Agreement, seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. This additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.

82

We plan to utilize the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand primarily to fund our commercial and marketing activities associated with clonoSEQ, our continued investments in streamlining our laboratory operations and our continued research and development initiatives related to drug discovery. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to capital preservation and liquidity. Currently, our funds are held in money market funds and marketable securities consisting of U.S. government treasury securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper.

While we may experience variability in revenue in the near term, over the long-term we expect revenue from our current and future products and services to grow. Accordingly, we expect our accounts receivable and inventory balances to increase. Our levels of accounts receivable may fluctuate relative to our revenue for a number of reasons, including the timing of milestone triggers and related payment of those milestones, as well as reductions in revenue derived from the upfront payment received under the Genentech Agreement and an increase in revenue generated from clinical customers, which may result in more billings in arrears as opposed to upfront payments. Any increase in accounts receivable and inventory may not be completely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which could result in greater working capital requirements.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024 include operating lease obligations of $107.6 million, which reflects the minimum commitments for our office and laboratory spaces in Seattle, Washington and South San Francisco, California and our warehouse lease in Bothell, Washington. See Note 10, 
Leases 
of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information, including the timing of cash payments related to these lease obligations. In connection with certain of our lease agreements, we have $2.1 million in letters of credit with one of our financial institutions.

Additionally, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers have a right to receive Revenue Interests from us based on the Applicable Payment Percentage of the Revenue Base. If only the First Payment has been made, the Applicable Payment Percentage shall be five percent of the quarterly Revenue Base. If both the First Payment and Second Payment have been made, the Applicable Payment Percentage shall be eight percent of the quarterly Revenue Base. If each of the First Payment, Second Payment and Third Payment have been made, the applicable payment percentage applied to the Revenue Interest shall be ten percent of the quarterly Revenue Base. Revenue Interest Payments shall be made quarterly within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter. If OrbiMed has not received Revenue Interest Payments in the aggregate equal to or greater than the Cumulative Purchaser Payments on or prior to September 12, 2028, the revenue interest rate shall be increased to a rate which, if applied retroactively to our cumulative Revenue Base, would have resulted in Revenue Interest Payments equal to the sum of all Cumulative Purchaser Payments. OrbiMed will be entitled to 100% of the Revenue Interest Payments until it has received the Return Cap, unless full repayment of the amount of the Return Cap has not been made by September 12, 2032, in which case the Return Cap shall be increased to 175% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments. As projected revenues change from our initial estimates, the amount of the obligation and timing of payment is likely to change. See Note 11, 
Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement
 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

We also have minimum commitments for laboratory material suppliers, which are generally fulfilled within one year, software and service license commitments, which are generally fulfilled within one to three years, and royalty commitments.

Operating Activities

Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $95.2 million, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of $159.6 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $17.5 million, partially offset by noncash share-based compensation of $53.6 million, noncash depreciation and amortization of $11.0 million, noncash impairment of long-lived assets of $7.2 million related to our restructuring activities, noncash lease expense of $5.3 million, noncash interest expense related to the Purchase Agreement of $2.6 million and inventory reserve expense of $1.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $10.5 million reduction in deferred revenue driven largely by revenue recognized from the Genentech Agreement, a $9.4 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities and a $3.7 million increase in accounts receivable, net. These changes were partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in inventory and a $0.7 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $156.3 million, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of $225.3 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $46.2 million, partially offset by noncash share-based compensation of $62.9 million, noncash impairment of right-of-use and related long-lived assets of $25.4 million, noncash depreciation and amortization of $13.0 million, noncash lease expense of $6.9 million, noncash interest expense related to the Purchase Agreement of $5.3 million and inventory reserve expense of $1.4 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $29.3 million reduction in deferred revenue driven largely by revenue recognized from the Genentech Agreement, an $8.7 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, a $5.4 million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $2.8 million increase in inventory and a $1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets driven largely by an increase in prepaid software charges. These changes were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, net.

Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $77.8 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $325.7 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $244.3 million and purchases of property and equipment of $3.7 million.

Cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $129.6 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $569.9 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $429.6 million and purchases of property and equipment of $10.7 million.

Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.2 million, which was attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.2 million, which was attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

84

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

Utilization of our NOL carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL carryforwards and credits before utilization. If there should be an ownership change, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and credits could be limited. We have completed a Section 382 analysis for changes in ownership through December 31, 2023 and continue to monitor for changes that could trigger a limitation. Based on this analysis, we do not expect to have any permanent limitations on the utilization of our federal NOLs. Under the TCJA, federal NOLs incurred in 2018 and future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is subject to an annual limitation. NOLs generated prior to 2018 are eligible to be carried forward up to 20 years. Based on the available objective evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would not be realizable as of December 31, 2024. Accordingly, management applied a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expense recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are used in several areas, including, but not limited to, estimates of progress to date for certain performance obligations and the transaction price for certain contracts with customers, imputing interest for the Purchase Agreement, the provision for income taxes, including related reserves, the analysis of goodwill impairment and the recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, among others. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments, involve the analysis of historical results and prediction of future trends, can require extended periods of time to resolve and are subject to change from period to period. Actual results may differ materially from management’s estimates.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, 
Significant Accounting Policies 
of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue arrangements may include upfront payments for the performance of services in the future, which have both fixed and variable consideration. Non-refundable upfront fees and funding for related development services are generally considered fixed consideration, while milestone payments are identified as variable consideration.

As we fulfill our obligations under these agreements, we perform the following steps to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized: (1) identify the contract or contracts; (2) determine whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (3) measure the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
 For our biopharmaceutical customers, our performance obligations may include sequencing services and services associated with regulatory submission and approval processes. Significant management judgment is applied to determine (1) the measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration, (2) the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations and (3) the appropriate input- or output-based method to recognize revenue and the extent of progress to date.

We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is not constrained to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.

85

To select the measure of progress, we consider the expectations of the performance period which may be based on customer-dependent estimates of samples or internal estimates of the performance period based on both the customer and our expected development timeframes. For our collaboration with Genentech, we estimate the extent of progress using a proportional performance model that uses an input method based on costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs of research and development efforts to pursue both the Shared Products and Personalized Product pathways. These estimates are based on our internal estimates and development timeframes, which are subject to revision based on the potential outcomes for both product pathways, decisions made by Genentech, regulatory feedback or other factors not currently known. We regularly review our expectations of the extent of progress, including whether any variable consideration is no longer constrained, and, if any changes in estimates are made, we recognize revenue using the cumulative catch-up method.

For agreements where we provide our clonoSEQ report to ordering physicians, we have identified one performance obligation: the delivery of a clonoSEQ report.

For arrangements with our commercial payors, the payment from the respective payors may vary based on the various reimbursement rates and patient responsibilities. As such, we consider the transaction price to be variable and record an estimate of the transaction price, subject to the constraint for variable consideration, as revenue at the time of delivery. The estimate of transaction price is based on historical and expected reimbursement rates with the various payors, which are monitored in subsequent periods and adjusted, as necessary, based on actual collection experience.

Revenue Interest Liability, Net and Related Imputed Interest

The revenue interest liability balance associated with the Purchase Agreement that we entered into in September 2022 with OrbiMed is presented net of unamortized issuance costs on the consolidated balance sheets. We impute our associated interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We calculate an effective interest rate which will amortize our related obligation to zero over the anticipated repayment period. The effective interest rate may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including changes in forecasted GAAP revenues. We evaluate the effective interest rate quarterly based on both achieved and forecasted revenues, utilizing the prospective method. The estimates of future revenues and resulting Revenue Interest Payments are based on key assumptions including population, penetration, probability of success and sales price, among others. A significant increase or decrease in or changes in timing of forecasted revenue will prospectively impact our interest expense and the time period for repayment. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical ten percent
 increase in forecasted quarterly revenue would not result in a material change in projected annual interest expense.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. We assess goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and upon any occurrence of triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that could indicate a potential impairment.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or both of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount. We evaluate certain qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, the market and industry in which we operate, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant entity- and reporting unit-specific events to determine if there are any negative trends or events that could indicate impairment. Key assumptions in this analysis include anticipated demand for our products and services, including industry and regulatory changes, revenue growth and financial performance trends. These assumptions are determined based on our historical performance and management’s forecasted results. Management’s estimates of forecasted results are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or both of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the allocated goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. To date, we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill.

86

Recoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. To test for recoverability, we compare the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to projected future net undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount is found to be unrecoverable, we then assess the asset's or asset group's fair value. We utilize the income approach to measure fair value, which requires management to make estimates regarding cash flow projections and discount rates. The extent to which the asset's or asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value represents the impairment cost to be recognized. Impairment losses, if incurred, are classified within the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with the use of the asset or asset group, if not separately stated within its own financial statement line item. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $7.2 million in impairment expense related to certain long-lived assets that were impaired in connection with restructuring activities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $25.4 million in impairment expense related to certain right-of-use and related leasehold improvement assets. See Note 15,

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $47.9 million and $65.1 million, respectively, held primarily in cash deposits and money market funds. As of December 31, 2024, we had short-term and long-term marketable securities of $208.0 million, held in U.S. government treasury securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2023, we had short-term marketable securities of $281.3 million, held in U.S. government treasury and agency securities, commercial paper and corporate bonds. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a $1.0 million decline in fair value of our available-for-sale securities, as compared to a $1.2 million decline as of December 31, 2023. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. We do not enter into investments for trading purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.

Report of Independent Regist
ered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures

to which it relates.

89

Genentech Agreement

Description of the Matter

As more fully described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Genentech Agreement revenue is estimated to be recognized over a period of nine to ten years from the effective date. The non-refundable consideration of $310.0 million is recognized using a proportional performance model through an input method based on costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs of research and development efforts. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total revenue recognized was $13.5 million and the related deferred revenue at December 31, 2024 totaled $41.3 million.

Auditing management’s estimate of the total expected research and development costs at completion is complex and requires judgment as a result of the uncertainties of the ultimate development and commercialization decisions, which are controlled by Genentech.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to evaluate the likely path of future development based on significant decisions made by Genentech communicated through the joint committees and any resulting impacts on the total costs of research and development efforts for the collaboration.

To test the estimate of total expected research and development costs, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, observing the quarterly meetings with accounting and the Company collaboration managers discussing the status of the collaboration and the likely path of future development. We also reviewed supporting documentation to corroborate progress and status of the collaboration, including meeting minutes or summaries from the joint committees.

1.
Organization and Description of Business
Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (“we,” “us” or “our”) is a commercial-stage company advancing the field of immune medicine by harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature’s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our immune medicine platform applies our proprietary technologies to read the diverse genetic code of a patient’s immune system and understand precisely how the immune system detects and treats disease in that patient. We capture these insights in our dynamic clinical immunomics database and related antigen annotations, which are underpinned by computational biology and machine learning, and use them to develop and commercialize clinical products and services that can be tailored to the needs of individual patients.
We were incorporated in the State of Washington on September 8, 2009 under the name Adaptive TCR Corporation. On December 21, 2011, we changed our name to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation. We are headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

2.
Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation, Adaptive Biotechnologies B.V., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Digital Biotechnologies, Inc., a corporate subsidiary we have 
70
% ownership interest in. The remaining interest in Digital Biotechnologies, Inc., held by certain of our related parties and their related family trusts, are shown in the consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are used in several areas including, but not limited to, estimates of progress to date for certain performance obligations and the transaction price for certain contracts with customers, share-based compensation, imputing interest for our revenue interest purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), the provision for income taxes, including related reserves, the analysis of goodwill impairment and the recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets
, among others. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments, involve the analysis of historical results and prediction of future trends, can require extended periods of time to resolve and are subject to change from period to period. Actual results may differ materially from management’s estimates.
Segment Information
We operate as 
two
 operating and reportable segments: Minimal Residual Disease (“MRD”) and Immune Medicine. 
We have determined that our chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM regularly reviews operating results and other financial information presented at the MRD and Immune Medicine segment level, as well as on a consolidated basis, to make resource allocation decisions. The MRD and Immune Medicine segments are also our two reporting units.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Cash equivalents include only securities having an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. We limit our credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by placing our investments with banks that we believe are highly creditworthy and with highly rated money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of bank deposits and investments in money market funds.
Restricted Cash
We had a restricted cash balance of 
$
2.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our restricted cash primarily relates to certain balances we are required to maintain under lease arrangements for some of our facility leases.

96

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Investments in Marketable Securities
Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale, consist of United States (“U.S.”
) government treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper and are reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a separate component of shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss. The cost of marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has defined fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The FASB established a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
A financial instrument categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In certain cases, where there is limited activity or less transparency around valuation inputs, financial instruments are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.

Our financial instruments consist of Level 1 and Level 2 assets and have included Level 3 liabilities in the past. The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments approximate fair value due to their short maturities. We did not have any nonfinancial assets or liabilities that were measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Concentrations of Risk
We are subject to a concentration of risk from a limited number of suppliers, or in certain cases, single suppliers, for some of our laboratory instruments and materials. This risk is managed by targeting a quantity of surplus stock.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. We invest in money market funds, U.S. government treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper with high-quality accredited financial institutions.

Significant customers are those that represent more than ten percent of our total revenue or accounts receivable, net balances for the periods and as of each consolidated balance sheet date presented, respectively. There were no customers that represented more than ten percent of our accounts receivable, net balances as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.

For each significant customer, revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented were as follows:

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers for services performed. We review our accounts receivable for credit impairment and regularly analyze the status of significant past due receivables to determine if any will potentially be uncollectible to estimate the amount of allowance necessary to reduce accounts receivable to its estimated net realizable value.
Inventory
Inventory consists of laboratory materials and supplies used in lab analysis. We capitalize inventory when purchased and record expense upon order fulfillment for servicing revenue or utilization in our research and development laboratories. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We periodically perform obsolescence assessments and write-off any inventory that is no longer usable. Long-term inventory of $
1.5
 million and $
2.8
 million was included within the other assets balance on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment consists of computer equipment, computer software, laboratory equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and office equipment and assets under construction. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method based on estimated useful life. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and costs of improvements are capitalized.
Useful lives assigned to property and equipment are as follows:

Laboratory equipment

3 years
 to 
7 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of estimated useful life or remaining lease term

Computer equipment and software

3 years
 to 
5 years

Furniture and office equipment

3 years
 to 
7 years

We review long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Gains and losses from asset disposals and impairment losses, if incurred, are classified within the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with the use of the asset or asset group, if not separately stated within its own financial statement line item. See Note 15, 
Restructurings 
and Note 10, 
Leases 
for more information regarding the impairment losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, which is regarded as their cost.
Intangible assets may also result from the purchase of assets and intellectual property in a transaction that does not qualify as a business combination. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis which approximates their usage pattern. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or if indicators of potential impairment exist. We have 
no
t recognized any impairment losses on intangible assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of attributed identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. We assess goodwill for impairment annually on October 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or both of our reporting units below its respective carrying value. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or both of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount. If we so determine, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the allocated goodwill is reduced to its fair value through an impairment charge recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. To date, we have 
no
t recognized any impairment of goodwill.

98

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Leases
We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. We have operating lease agreements for the laboratory, office and warehouse facilities that we occupy. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the date the underlying asset becomes available for our use and are based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. As our leases generally do not provide an implicit interest rate, the present value of our future minimum lease payments is determined using our incremental borrowing rate. This rate is an estimate of the collateralized borrowing rate we would incur on our future lease payments over a similar term and is based on the information available to us at the lease commencement date, or as of 
January 1, 2020
 for commenced leases that existed as of our 
adoption
 of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, 
Leases
 (Topic 842).

Certain of our leases contain options to extend or terminate the lease; lease terms are adjusted for these options only when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these options. Our lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or covenants.
We have made a policy election regarding our real estate leases not to separate nonlease components from lease components, to the extent they are fixed. Nonlease components that are not fixed are expensed as incurred as variable lease expense. Our leases for laboratory, office and warehouse facilities typically include variable nonlease components, such as common-area maintenance costs. We have also elected not to record on the consolidated balance sheets a lease that has a lease term of twelve months or less and does not contain a purchase option that we are reasonably certain to exercise.
We review our right-of-use assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are classified within the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with the use of the asset or asset group, if not separately stated within its own financial statement line item. See Note 15, 
Restructurings 
and Note 10, 
Leases 
for more information regarding the right-of-use asset and related long-lived asset impairment losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Incentives granted under our facilities leases, including rent holidays, are recognized as adjustments to lease expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.
Revenue Interest Liability, Net and Related Imputed Interest
The revenue interest liability balance associated with the Purchase Agreement that we entered into in September 2022 is presented net of unamortized issuance costs on the consolidated balance sheets. We impute our associated interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We calculate an effective interest rate which will amortize our related obligation to zero over the anticipated repayment period. The effective interest rate may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including changes in forecasted GAAP revenues. We evaluate the effective interest rate quarterly based on both achieved and forecasted revenues, utilizing the prospective method. A significant increase or decrease in or changes in timing of forecasted revenue will prospectively impact our interest expense and the time period for repayment.

Revenue Recognition
For all revenue-generating contracts, we perform the following steps to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized: (1) identify the contract or contracts; (2) determine whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (3) measure the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation.
We derive revenue by providing diagnostic and research services in our MRD and Immune Medicine business areas. Our MRD revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing our clonoSEQ report to clinical customers; (2) providing MRD sample testing services to biopharmaceutical customers and certain academic institutions, including investigator-led clinical trials; and (3) providing our clonoSEQ report or results to certain international laboratory sites through technology transfers. Our Immune Medicine revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing sample testing services for our commercial research product, Adaptive Immunosequencing, to biopharmaceutical customers and academic institutions; (2) our collaboration agreements with Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”) and other biopharmaceutical customers in areas of drug and target discovery; and (3) for years prior to 2023, providing our T-Detect COVID tests to clinical customers.
For agreements where we provide our clonoSEQ report to ordering physicians, we have identified one performance obligation: the delivery of a clonoSEQ report. We bill and receive payments for these transactions from commercial, government and medical institution payors. As payment from the respective payors may vary based on the various reimbursement rates and patient responsibilities, we consider the transaction price to be variable and record an estimate of the transaction price, subject to the constraint for variable consideration, as revenue at the time of delivery. The estimate of transaction price is based on historical and expected reimbursement rates with the various payors, which are monitored in subsequent periods and adjusted, as necessary, based on actual collection experience.

99

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Regarding our clonoSEQ coverage under Medicare, we bill an episode of treatment when we deliver the first eligible test report. This billing contemplates all necessary tests required during a patient’s treatment cycle, which is currently estimated at approximately four tests per patient, including the initial sequence identification test. Revenue recognition commences at the time the initial billable test report is delivered and is based upon cumulative tests delivered to date. We estimate the number of tests we expect to deliver over a patient’s treatment cycle based on historical testing frequencies for patients by indication. These estimates are subject to change as we develop more information about utilization over time. Any unrecognized revenue from the initial billable test is recorded as deferred revenue and is recognized either as we deliver our estimate of the remaining tests in a patient’s treatment cycle or when the likelihood becomes remote that a patient will receive additional testing.
The contract transaction price for agreements we enter into with biopharmaceutical customers to further develop and commercialize their therapeutics may consist of a combination of non-refundable upfront fees, separately priced MRD testing fees and milestone fees earned upon our customers’ achievement of certain regulatory approvals. Depending on the contract, these agreements include single or multiple performance obligations. Such performance obligations include providing services to support our customers’ therapeutic development efforts, including regulatory support where our technology is intended to be utilized as part of our customers’ registrational trials, developing analytical plans for our data, participating on joint committees, assisting in completing a regulatory submission and providing MRD testing services related to customer-provided samples for our customers' regulatory submissions. Generally, the support services, excluding MRD testing services, are not distinct within the context of the contract and thus are accounted for as a single performance obligation. The transaction price allocated to the respective performance obligations is estimated using an adjusted market assessment approach for the regulatory support services and a standalone selling price for the estimated MRD testing services. When MRD sample testing services are separately priced customer options, we assess if a material right exists and, if not, the customer option to purchase additional MRD sample testing services is not considered part of the contract. We recognize revenue related to MRD testing services over time using an output method based on the proportion of sample results delivered relative to the total amount of sample results expected to be delivered, when expected to be a faithful depiction of progress. We use the same method to recognize the regulatory support services. When an output method based on the proportion of sample results delivered is not expected to be a faithful depiction of progress, we utilize an input method using a cost-based model based on estimates of effort completed. Selecting the measure of progress and estimating progress to date requires significant judgment. Except for any non-refundable upfront fees, the other forms of compensation represent variable consideration. At contract inception, we fully constrain any consideration related to regulatory milestones, as the achievement of such milestones is subject to third-party regulatory approval and the customers’ own submission decision-making. Variable consideration related to regulatory milestones is estimated using the most likely amount method, where variable consideration is constrained until it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur. Milestone payments for regulatory approvals, which are not within our customers’ control, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. Determining whether regulatory milestone payments are probable is an area that requires significant judgment. In making this assessment, we evaluate scientific, clinical, regulatory and other risks, as well as the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone.
For research customers who utilize either our MRD or Adaptive Immunosequencing services, contracts typically include an amount billed in advance of services (“upfront”) and subsequent billings as sample results are delivered to the customer. Upfront amounts received are recorded as deferred revenue, which we recognize as revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. We have identified 
two
 typical performance obligations under the terms of our research service contracts: (1) the delivery of our MRD data or Adaptive Immunosequencing for customer provided samples; and (2) related data analysis. We recognize revenue for both identified performance obligations as sample results are delivered to the customer. In periods where our sample estimates are reduced or a customer project is cancelled and, in either case, we have remaining related deferred revenue, we recognize revenue using a cumulative catch-up approach based on the proportion of samples delivered to date relative to the total samples expected to be delivered.
Contract Balances
In certain circumstances, billing may occur prior to services being performed. Upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue, or contract liabilities. We classify deferred revenue as current when we expect our performance obligations will be completed within the next twelve months; however, we do not control the timing of customer provided samples. For service and collaboration activities, excluding those related to our worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, we assess the performance obligations and recognize deferred revenue as current or non-current based upon forecasted delivery times, which are customer coordinated. In certain circumstances, a customer project may be cancelled or terminated prior to the delivery of all related services covered by a customer’s upfront payment. In these circumstances, we recognize revenue when sufficient evidence is obtained that a reversal of revenue is not probable. We also recognize revenue when our estimate of total samples to be provided under certain of our agreements is reduced or, in the case of contract balances related to Medicare, when the likelihood becomes remote that a patient will receive additional testing. See Note 3, 
Revenue 
for our deferred revenue policy related to our worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech.

Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation includes compensation expense for stock option, restricted stock unit and market-based restricted stock unit grants made to employees and non-employees. It represents the grant date fair value of the grants and is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock option and market-based restricted stock unit grants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the Monte Carlo valuation model, respectively.

Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were 
$
6.1
 million, 
$
8.6
 million and 
$
13.7
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes the cost of materials, personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), shipping and handling expenses, equipment costs, allocated facility costs associated with processing samples and professional support costs related to our service revenue activities. Allocated facility costs include depreciation of laboratory equipment, as well as allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. Costs associated with processing samples are recorded as expense, regardless of the timing of revenue recognition.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist of laboratory materials costs, personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), equipment costs, allocated facility and information technology costs and contract service expenses. Research and development activities support further development and refinement of existing assays and products, discovery of new technologies and investments in our immune medicine platform. We also include in research and development expenses the costs associated with software development of applications to support future commercial opportunities, as well as development activities to support laboratory scaling and workflow. Additionally, a component of our research and development expenses are costs supporting clinical and analytical validations to obtain regulatory approval for future clinical products and services. 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Upfront payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized, then are recognized as an expense as the goods are consumed or the related services are performed. Costs to support our worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech are also a component of our research and development expenses.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing expenses include personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation) for commercial sales, product and account management, marketing, reimbursement, medical education and business development personnel that support commercialization of our platform products. In addition, these expenses include external costs such as advertising expenses, customer education and promotional expenses, market analysis expenses, conference fees, travel expenses and allocated facility and information technology costs.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Expenses
Impairment of long-lived assets expenses include our impairment charges for certain leased office and laboratory space, related long-lived assets (including leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment) and long-lived assets associated with our halted software enhancements.
Interest Expense
Interest expense includes costs associated with our revenue interest liability and noncash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related deferred issuance costs. We impute interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We calculate an effective interest rate which will amortize our related obligation to zero over the anticipated repayment period. A significant increase or decrease in or changes in timing of forecasted revenue will prospectively impact our interest expense.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and the operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the consolidated balance sheet date using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in the period such tax rate changes are enacted. Our net deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance, because of our history of losses.
We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination.
Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation Common Shareholders
We calculate basic net loss per share attributable to our common shareholders by dividing net loss attributable to us by our weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share attributable to our common shareholders is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock method. For purposes of this calculation, outstanding stock options, nonvested restricted stock units outstanding and the maximum nonvested market-based restricted stock units outstanding eligible to be earned are considered common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to our common shareholders, as their effect is anti-dilutive.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $
0.7
 million in Immune Medicine service revenue related to cancelled customer contracts. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $
5.2
 million in MRD service revenue related to Medicare reimbursements resulting from our determination that the likelihood of additional testing for specific patients was remote, changes in estimates of total samples to be provided under certain of our agreements and cancelled customer contracts.
As of December 31, 2024, we could receive up to an additional 
$
418.5
 million in 
milestone payments in future periods if certain regulatory approvals are obtained by our customers’ therapeutics in connection with MRD data generated from our MRD product.
Genentech Collaboration Agreement
In December 2018, we entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech (the “Genentech Agreement”) to leverage our capability to develop cellular therapies in oncology. Subsequent to receipt of regulatory approval in January 2019, we received a non-refundable, upfront payment of $
300.0
 million in February 2019. We also received a $
10.0
 million milestone in 2023. We may be eligible to receive an additional $
1.8
 billion over time, including payments of up to $
65.0
 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, up to $
300.0
 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and up to $
1,430.0
 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. In addition, we are separately able to receive tiered royalties at a rate ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens on aggregate worldwide net sales of products arising from the strategic collaboration, subject to certain reductions, with aggregate minimum floors. Under the Genentech Agreement, we are pursuing two product development pathways for novel T cell therapeutic products in which Genentech intends to use T cell receptors (
“TCRs”
) screened by our immune medicine platform to engineer and manufacture cellular medicines:
•
Shared Products. The shared products will use “off-the-shelf” TCRs identified against cancer antigens shared among patients (“Shared Products”). 
•
Personalized Product. The personalized product will use patient-specific TCRs identified by real-time screening of TCRs against cancer antigens in each patient (“Personalized Product”). 

103

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we granted Genentech exclusive worldwide licenses to develop and commercialize TCR-based cellular therapies in the field of oncology, including licenses to existing shared antigen data packages. Additionally, Genentech has the right to determine which product candidates to further develop for commercialization purposes. We determined that this arrangement meets the criteria set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (
“ASC”
) Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 (“ASC 808”), because both parties are active participants in the activity and are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the activity’s commercial failure or success. Because ASC 808 does not provide guidance on how to account for the activities under a collaborative arrangement, we applied the guidance in ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(
“ASC 606”
) to account for the activities related to the Genentech Agreement.

In applying ASC 606, we identified the following performance obligations at the inception of the agreement:

1.
License to utilize on an exclusive basis all TCR-specific platform intellectual property to develop and commercialize any licensed products in the field of oncology. 
2.
License to utilize all data and information within each shared antigen data package and any other know-how disclosed by us to Genentech in oncology. 
3.
License to utilize all private antigen TCR product data in connection with research and development activities in the field of use. 
4.
License to existing shared antigen data packages. 
5.
Research and development services for Shared Products development, including expansion of shared antigen data packages. 
6.
Research and development services for private product development. 
7.
Obligations to participate on various joint research, development and project committees. 
We determined that none of the licenses, research and development services or obligations to participate on various committees were distinct within the context of the contract, given such rights and activities were highly interrelated and there was substantial additional research and development to further develop the licenses. We considered factors such as the stage of development of the respective existing antigen data packages, the subsequent development that would be required to both identify and submit a potential target for investigational new drug acceptance under both product pathways and the variability in research and development pathways given Genentech’s control of product commercialization. Specifically, under the Genentech Agreement, Genentech is not required to pursue development or commercialization activities pertaining to both product pathways and may choose to proceed with one or the other. Accordingly, we determined that all of the identified performance obligations were attributable to one general performance obligation, which is to further the development of our TCR-specific platform, including data packages, and continue to make our TCR identification process available to Genentech to pursue either product pathway.
Separately, we have a responsibility to Genentech to enter into a supply and manufacturing agreement for patient-specific TCRs as it pertains to any Personalized Product therapeutic. We determined this was an option right of Genentech should they pursue commercialization of a Personalized Product therapy. Because of the uncertainty resulting from the early stage of development, the novel approach of our collaboration with Genentech and our rights to future commercial milestones and royalty payments, we determined that this option right was not a material right that should be accounted for at inception. As such, we will account for the supply and manufacturing agreement when entered into between the parties.

We determined the initial transaction price shall be made up of only the $
300.0
 million upfront, non-refundable payment, as all potential regulatory and development milestone payments were probable of significant revenue reversal given their achievement was highly dependent on factors outside our control. As a result, these payments were fully constrained and were not included in the initial transaction price. In May 2023, one of the regulatory milestones was achieved, resulting in a $
10.0
 million addition to the transaction price, $
7.7
 million of which was recognized as revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2023, with the remainder included in deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue over the remaining research and development period. We continue to exclude the commercial milestones and potential royalties from the transaction price, as those items relate predominantly to the license rights granted to Genentech and will be assessed when and if such events occur.
As there are potential substantive developments necessary, which Genentech may be able to direct, we determined that we would apply a proportional performance model to recognize revenue for our performance obligation. We measure proportional performance using an input method based on costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs of research and development efforts to pursue both the Shared Products and Personalized Product pathways. When any of the potential regulatory and development milestones are no longer fully constrained and are included in the transaction price, such amounts will be recognized using the cumulative catch-up method based on proportional performance at such time. We currently expect to recognize revenue generated from the Genentech Agreement over a period of approximately 
nine
 to 
ten years
 from the effective date. This estimate of the research and development period considers pursuit options of development activities supporting both the Shared Products and Personalized Product, but may be reduced or increased based on the various activities as directed by the joint committees, decisions made by Genentech, regulatory feedback or other factors not currently known.

We periodically review our available-for-sale securities to assess for credit impairment. Some of the factors considered in assessing impairment include the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions related to the security, an industry or geographic area, changes to security ratings or sector credit ratings and other relevant market data.
As of December 31, 2024, we did not intend, nor were we more likely than not to be required, to sell our available-for-sale investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Based on our assessment, we concluded all impairment as of December 31, 2024 to be due to factors other than credit loss, such as changes in interest rates. A credit allowance was not recognized and the impairment of our available-for-sale securities was recorded in other comprehensive loss.

Leases
We have operating lease agreements for laboratory, office and warehouse facilities that we occupy in various locations.

In July 2011, we entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement with an, at the time, minority shareholder for office and laboratory space in Seattle, Washington. The lease terms were subsequently amended multiple times, most recently in August 2019, when we expanded the existing premises to approximately 
65,500
 square feet. 
Cash payment for rent of the expanded premises commenced 
January 2020
, four months after the landlord delivered the expanded premises to us for construction of certain tenant improvements, and the lease term for both the existing premises and the expanded premises ends 
October 2032
, subject to our option to twice extend the lease for 
five years
.
 The amended lease also requires us to pay additional amounts for operating and maintenance expenses.
In 2023, we vacated this leased space. As such, we assessed the right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements (together, the "asset group") for impairment by first comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows projected to be generated over the remaining lease term. These projections include management's estimates of cash inflows from potential sublease income and outflows for operating and maintenance expenses. The carrying amount was found to be unrecoverable, thus we assessed the asset group's fair value. The extent to which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value represents the impairment cost to be recognized. Fair value was determined using the income approach, whereby we discounted estimated net cash flows using a rate commensurate with our estimated incremental borrowing rate. As a result of this assessment, which included unrecoverable operating and maintenance costs, we determined that the asset group was to be fully impaired. As such, an 
impairment charge
 of $
25.4
 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, $
21.2
 million of which related to the right-of-use asset and $
4.2
 million of which related to the long-lived leasehold improvements, all of which were held for use.
In August 2019, we entered into an agreement to rent approximately 
100,000
 square feet in what was a to-be-constructed, new headquarters building in Seattle, Washington. In connection with the lease, we entered into a $
2.1
 million letter of credit with one of our existing financial institutions. The lease commenced in 
December 2020
, when the landlord delivered the premises to us for construction of certain tenant improvements. We occupied the new building in 2021, 
cash payment for rent began in 
October 2021
 and the lease term ends in 
August 2033
, 
subject to our option to 
twice extend the lease
 for 
five years
. In connection with this lease, the landlord agreed to fund $
20.0
 million in improvements, which was subsequently reduced to $
14.8
 million as a result of our change requests made during landlord construction of the building, net of an administration fee. We incurred $
14.9
 million in certain tenant improvement costs, all of which had been reimbursed by the landlord as of December 31, 2022. The lease also requires us to pay additional amounts for operating and maintenance expenses.
In April 2018, we entered into a lease agreement to lease approximately 
13,400
 square feet in South San Francisco, California. 
The lease term is through 
March 2026
 and provides for 
one 
five-year
 extension option
.
 We are responsible for our share of allocable operating expenses, tax expenses and utilities costs during the duration of the lease term. In connection with the lease, the landlord funded agreed-upon improvements. The landlord was solely responsible for the $
2.4
 million cost of such improvements. The lease agreement was amended in February 2020 to lease approximately 
19,900
 additional square feet and provides for a $
0.6
 million tenant improvement allowance. In 2024, as part of a restructuring, we vacated certain of the leased space in South San Francisco, California and incurred a related impairment charge. See Note 15, 
Restructurings 
for more information.

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

In March 2021, we executed a lease to rent approximately 
27,000
 square feet of a warehouse in Bothell, Washington, which we classified as an operating lease upon commencement during the year ended December 31, 2021. Rent obligations commenced in 
October 2021
 and the lease expires 
October 2031
, 
subject to an early termination option after the seventh year
 and an 
option to twice extend the lease for 
five years
. The lease requires us to pay certain operating expenses. Furthermore, the landlord agreed to fund $
1.2
 million in improvements in connection with this lease.
As of December 31, 2024, we were not party to any finance leases. Our leases have remaining terms ranging from 
1.2
 years to 
8.7
 years and include 
options to 
extend certain of the leases
 up to 
10.0
 years
 and terminate certain of the leases after 
7.0
 years of leasing. We adjust lease terms for these options only when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these options.

Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement
Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement

In September 2022, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with OrbiMed Royalty & Credit Opportunities IV, LP (“OrbiMed”), an affiliate of OrbiMed Advisors LLC, as collateral agent and administrative agent for the purchasers party thereto (the “Purchasers”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we received $
125.0
 million from the Purchasers at closing (the “First Payment”), less certain transaction expenses. We are also entitled to receive up to $
125.0
 million in subsequent installments as follows: (i) $
75.0
 million upon our request occurring no later than 
September 12, 2025
 (the “Second Payment”) and (ii) $
50.0
 million upon our request in connection with certain permitted acquisitions occurring no later than 
September 12, 2025
 (the “Third Payment”), in each case subject to certain funding conditions. 
To secure our obligations under the Purchase Agreement, we and our subsidiaries have granted OrbiMed a security interest in our core platform technology assets, subject to certain customary exclusions, as defined in the Purchase Agreement.

Revenue Interest Payments

As consideration for such payments, the Purchasers have a right to receive certain revenue interests (the “Revenue Interests”) from us based on a percentage (the “Applicable Payment Percentage”) of all GAAP revenue (the “Revenue Base”). If only the First Payment has been made, the Applicable Payment Percentage shall be five percent of the quarterly Revenue Base. If both the First Payment and Second Payment have been made, the Applicable Payment Percentage shall be eight percent of the quarterly Revenue Base. If each of the First Payment, Second Payment and Third Payment have been made, the applicable payment percentage applied to the Revenue Interest shall be ten percent of the quarterly Revenue Base.
Payments in respect of the Revenue Interests shall be made quarterly within 
45
 days following the end of each fiscal quarter (each, a “Revenue Interest Payment”). If OrbiMed has not received Revenue Interest Payments in the aggregate equal to or greater than the sum of its invested capital (the “Cumulative Purchaser Payments”) on or prior to September 12, 2028, the revenue interest rate shall be increased to a rate which, if applied retroactively to our cumulative Revenue Base, would have resulted in Revenue Interest Payments equal to the sum of all Cumulative Purchaser Payments.
Return Cap

OrbiMed will be entitled to 
100
% of the Revenue Interest Payments until it has received a total cumulative value of 
165
% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments (the “Return Cap”), unless full repayment of the amount of the Return Cap has not been made by 
September 12, 2032
, in which case the Return Cap shall be increased to 
175
% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments.
Put/Call Options

Upon the occurrence of a Put Option Event (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), including material divestitures by us, a change in control, material judgments, or bankruptcy events, Purchasers representing at least a majority of the purchase commitments under the Purchase Agreement shall have the right but not the obligation ("the Put Option") to require us to repurchase all of the outstanding Revenue Interests at the applicable price (the “Put/Call Price”). Additionally, at any time following receipt of the First Payment, we may exercise a call option to repurchase all Revenue Interests at the applicable Put/Call Price.

For all Put Option Events other than a change of control or a material divestiture, the Put/Call Price shall be an amount equal to the applicable Return Cap. For a change of control or a material divestiture, the Put/Call Price shall be equal to the applicable Return Cap.
Accounting Treatment
We evaluated the terms of the Purchase Agreement and concluded that the features of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments are similar to those of a debt instrument. Accordingly, we accounted for the transaction as debt recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. We further evaluated the terms of the debt and determined that the Put Option that is exercisable by the Purchasers upon certain contingent events requires bifurcation as a derivative. However, the value of the Put Option was determined to be immaterial due to the remote possibility of exercise. We assess the value of the Put Option periodically.

To determine the amortization of the Purchase Agreement obligation, we are required to estimate the amount and timing of future Revenue Interest Payments based on our estimate of the timing and amount of future revenues and calculate an effective interest rate which will amortize the obligation to 
zero
 over the amortization period. The calculated effective interest rate as of December 31, 2024 was 
8.8
%.
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, we incurred debt issuance costs of $
0.6
 million. Debt issuance costs have been recorded to debt and are being amortized over the estimated term of the debt using the effective interest method.

The assumptions used in determining the expected repayment term of the obligation and amortization period of the issuance costs requires that we make estimates that could impact the short- and long-term classification of these costs, as well as the period over which these costs will be amortized. We periodically assess the amount and timing of expected Revenue Interest Payments based on internal forecasts. To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the revenue interest liability and the issuance costs, as well as the effective interest rate.

Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings

We are subject to claims and assessments from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. We were not party to any material legal proceedings as of December 31, 2024.
Indemnification Agreements

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, customers and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of our agreements with them or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with members of our board of directors and certain of our executive officers that will require us to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. We have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and are not currently aware of any indemnification claims.

Equity Incentive Plans
2009 Equity Incentive Plan
We adopted an equity incentive plan in 2009 (the “2009 Plan”) that provided for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified common stock options and other share-based awards for employees, directors and consultants. Under the 2009 Plan, the exercise price for incentive and nonqualified stock options were not to be less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Stock options granted under this plan expire no later than 
ten years
 from the grant date and vesting was established at the time of grant. Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Plan, any shares subject to outstanding stock options originally granted under the 2009 Plan that terminate, expire or lapse for any reason without the delivery of shares to the holder thereof shall become available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2019 Plan. While 
no
 shares are available for future grant under the 2009 Plan, it continues to govern outstanding equity awards granted thereunder.
2019 Equity Incentive Plan
The 2019 Plan became effective immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering in July 2019. The 2019 Plan provides for the issuance of awards in the form of stock options and other share-based awards for employees, directors and consultants. Under the 2019 Plan, the stock option exercise price per share shall not be less than the fair market value of a share of stock on the effective date of grant, as defined by the 2019 Plan, unless explicitly qualified under the provisions of Section 409A or Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Additionally, unless otherwise specified, stock options granted under this plan expire no later than 
ten years
 from the grant date and vesting is established at the time of grant. Except for certain awards granted to non-employee directors, stock options and restricted stock units granted under the 2019 Plan generally vest over a 
four-year
 period, subject to continuous service through each applicable vesting date. As of December 31, 2024, we had

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the fair value of our common stock, as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables that are subjective and generally require judgment to determine. The valuation assumptions were determined as follows:

Fair value of common stock—
The fair value of each share of common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, or other relevant determination date, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Expected term
—The expected term of stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors is determined using the “simplified” method, as illustrated in ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation
, as we do not have sufficient exercise history to determine a better estimate of expected term. Under this approach, the expected term is 
based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the stock option.
Risk-free interest rate
—We utilize a risk-free interest rate in the option valuation model based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected terms of the stock options.
Expected volatility
—Until 2024, as we did not have sufficient trading history for our common stock, expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded industry peers utilizing a period of time consistent with our estimate of expected term. 
Beginning in 2024, expected volatility was based on a weighted average of our historical volatility and the historical volatility of our publicly traded industry peers utilizing a period of time consistent with our estimate of expected term.
Expected dividend yield
—We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of 
zero
 in the option valuation model.

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 
$
2.70
, 
$
5.61
 and 
$
7.36
, respectively.

The grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted 
is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, or other relevant determination date, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 
$
4.03

Aggregate share-based compensation expense is calculated based on the target payout level of shares granted and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective grants' performance periods, which are also the requisite service periods. Attainment of each grant's respective market condition and the number of shares earned and vested does not impact the related share-based compensation expense recognized. Share-based compensation expense is reversed only if the respective grantee does not provide continuous service through the respective performance period for reasons other than those expressly provided in the terms of the respective award.

Restructurings
In 2022, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and reduced our workforce by approximately 
100
 employees. We incurred aggregate restructuring costs of $
2.0
 million, all of which was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. These costs primarily related to one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefit arrangements, both of which included severance payments and extended benefits coverage support and were contingent upon the impacted employees’ execution and non-revocation of separation agreements. Our aggregate restructuring costs also included certain contract termination costs. The activities related to this reduction in workforce were primarily completed in March 2022 and the $
2.0
 million aggregate restructuring costs were paid as of December 31, 2022.
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our organization to our 
two
 operating segments: MRD and Immune Medicine. We incurred aggregate restructuring costs of $
1.0
 million, primarily related to one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefit arrangements.
During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we implemented additional restructuring initiatives which impacted certain planned software enhancements and resulted in the consolidation of certain research and development workflows. The impacted software enhancements were primarily associated with our laboratory information management systems. As part of these restructurings, we had long-lived assets that were no longer being utilized and we vacated certain leased space in South San Francisco, California. As such, we assessed the related assets for impairment by first comparing their carrying amounts to the future net undiscounted cash flows projected to be generated over their remaining lease terms or depreciable lives, as applicable. The carrying amounts were all found to be unrecoverable, thus we assessed the fair values of the assets. The extent to which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their fair values represents the impairment costs to be recognized. As a result of our assessments, we recognized $
7.2
 million of impairment charges. Of the $
7.2
 million charges recognized, $
1.1
 million and $
3.3
 million relates to the right-of-use asset and related long-lived assets (namely laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements), respectively, associated with certain of our leased space in South San Francisco, California. The remaining $
2.8
 million recognized relates to the impairment of long-lived assets associated with our halted software enhancements. We also incurred an additional $
0.7
 million in restructuring costs primarily related to one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefit arrangements.
During the six months ended December 31, 2024, we incurred an additional $
0.3
 million in aggregate restructuring costs, which primarily related to one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefit arrangements.
In total, we recognized restructuring costs of $
9.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. The activities and payments related to these restructurings were completed and paid as of December 31, 2024.

ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses ("NOLs"), temporary differences and credit carryforwards be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses that realization is “more likely than not.” Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Because of our history of operating losses, management believes that recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above-mentioned future tax benefits is currently not likely to be realized and, accordingly, has provided a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $
33.1
 million and $
55.8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Federal tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Accordingly, our ability to utilize these carryforwards may be limited due to such ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382 analysis for changes in ownership through December 31, 2023 and continue to monitor for changes that could trigger a limitation. Based on this analysis, we do not expect to have any permanent limitations on the utilization of our federal NOLs. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 federal income tax law, federal NOLs incurred in 2018 and future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is subject to an annual limitation. NOLs generated prior to 2018 are eligible to be carried forward up to 
20
 years. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal NOLs of $
192.5
 million and U.S. federal tax credits of $
51.1
 million that will begin to expire in 
2028
. We also had $
856.6
 million of NOLs as of December 31, 2024 that do not expire.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized uncertain tax positions of $
1.4
 million, $
1.2
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively, related to a reduction of the research and development credit deferred tax asset. Unrecognized tax benefits may change during the next twelve months for items that arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months that would have an adverse effect on our operating results.
We recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We had 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
We file federal and certain state income tax returns, which provide varying statutes of limitations on assessments. However, because of NOL carryforwards, substantially all tax years since inception remain open to federal and state tax examination.

Segment Information
In 2024, in connection with an organizational realignment, we began operating our business as 
two
 reportable segments: MRD and Immune Medicine. These segments are organized by market opportunity in commercial diagnostics and drug discovery, respectively.
The MRD business focuses on the use of our highly sensitive, next-generation sequencing assay to measure MRD in patients with hematologic malignancies. It is comprised of our clonoSEQ clinical diagnostic test, offered to clinicians, and our clonoSEQ assay, offered to biopharmaceutical partners to advance drug development efforts. Our MRD revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing our clonoSEQ report to clinical customers; (2) providing MRD sample testing services to biopharmaceutical customers and certain academic institutions, including investigator-led clinical trials; and (3) providing our clonoSEQ report or results to certain international laboratory sites through technology transfers.
The Immune Medicine business leverages our proprietary ability to sequence, map, pair and characterize TCRs and B cell receptors at scale. We have created a powerful data engine to drive the development of novel therapies. Our Immune Medicine revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing sample testing services for our commercial research product, Adaptive Immunosequencing, to biopharmaceutical customers and academic institutions; (2) our collaboration agreements with Genentech and other biopharmaceutical customers in areas of drug and target discovery; and (3) for years prior to 2023, providing our T-Detect COVID tests to clinical customers.
There are 
no
 inter-segment revenues. See Note 3, Revenue for more information about each segment's revenue. Our CODM, which is our 
chief executive officer
, 
evaluates performance of the MRD segment based on both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and evaluates performance of the Immune Medicine segment based on Adjusted EBITDA. These measures help our CODM assess the trends and operating margin profile of the respective segments, which helps drive the level of investment made in each business. These measures also help our CODM assess and manage the potential capital utilization of each segment. Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments includes costs that are directly aligned to each segment, as well as certain allocated shared expenses.

These shared expenses primarily relate to our general and administrative functions, our non-laboratory facility space in our corporate headquarters and our production laboratory. We use the relative direct headcount assigned to each of the respective segments and our production laboratory sample volume to allocate these expenses. We do not allocate certain expenses, such as our corporate insurance costs, external legal and audit costs and expenses related to our investor relations, chief executive officer and other related support functions.
 Additionally, we do not allocate costs related to our idle facility in Seattle, Washington, interest expense related to our Purchase Agreement nor interest and other income, net. Given these unallocated costs and income are not included in the measurements reviewed by the CODM to assess each segment's performance, they are included in an "Unallocated Corporate" category. Our allocation methodology will be periodically evaluated and may change. Our CODM is not regularly provided and does not review assets to assess each segment's performance, make strategic decisions or allocate resources. As such, assets for reportable segments are not disclosed.

Segment information for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented on a comparable basis to that of the current period and is based on judgments and allocation methods from our organizational changes implemented during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
