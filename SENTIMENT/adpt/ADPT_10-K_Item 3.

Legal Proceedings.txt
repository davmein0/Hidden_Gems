FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management. Some of the statements in the “Business,” “Risk Factors,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words.

These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain. Forward-looking statements expressed or implied in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to, statements about:

•
the success of our significant investments in our continued research and development of new products;

•
the success of developing, commercializing and achieving commercial market acceptance of clonoSEQ, Adaptive Immunosequencing, T cell receptor (“TCR”)-based cellular therapies, antibody-based therapeutics products and additional products beyond our portfolio;

the potential for our identified research priorities to advance our proprietary immune medicine ("IM") platform or our future products;

•
the success, cost and timing of our research and development activities, preclinical and clinical studies and, in certain instances, clinical trials and clinical validations;

•
the potential benefits of collaborations, our ability to enter into collaborations or arrangements and our ability to attract collaborators with development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization expertise; 

•
the ability and willingness of our collaborators to continue development, manufacturing, distribution and commercialization activities relating to our jointly developed products;

•
our ability to obtain equipment and materials (including reagents or other materials that may also require additional internal validation) from our suppliers, and in some cases single suppliers;

In addition, you should refer to the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if the forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements herein represent our views as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “Adaptive” and the “Company” refer to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation.
