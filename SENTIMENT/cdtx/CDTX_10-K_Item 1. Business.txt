Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
We are a biotechnology company using our proprietary Cloudbreak
®
 platform to develop drug-Fc conjugate, or DFC, immunotherapies designed to save lives and improve the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases.
Our lead clinical-stage asset is CD388, a DFC intended for influenza prophylaxis, which we discovered and advanced to the clinic under a partnership with J&J Innovative Medicine, previously Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, or Janssen. To date, we have completed two Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2a study of CD388 under our prior license and collaboration agreement we entered into with Janssen in March 2021, or Janssen Collaboration Agreement. In 2023, as part of a prioritization of its research and development, or R&D, business, Janssen disclosed its intention to discontinue internal development of multiple product candidates in its infectious disease pipeline, including CD388. Through a competitive process, we reacquired all rights to develop and commercialize CD388 by executing a license and technology transfer agreement with Janssen, or the Janssen License Agreement, in April 2024. Under the terms of the Janssen License Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide, fee-bearing but royalty-free license under certain Janssen-controlled technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds, including CD388.
Concurrent with the CD388 reacquisition, we completed a private placement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 240,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock to certain institutional and other accredited investors, or the April 2024 Private Placement, which was led by RA Capital Management, with significant participation from Bain Capital Life Sciences, Biotech Value Fund, or BVF, and Canaan Partners. The April 2024 Private Placement provided $240.0 million in gross proceeds, of which we used $85.0 million to fund the upfront payment under the Janssen License Agreement. The remainder of the gross proceeds of $155.0 million are being utilized to develop CD388 as a universal preventative against seasonal and pandemic influenza A and B, beginning with the current CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study that we initiated in September 2024. We believe the reacquisition of CD388 is transformational for Cidara and potentially for those who could benefit from a long-acting, universal preventative against known forms of influenza.
In addition, in April 2024 we simultaneously divested rezafungin, our sole non-Cloudbreak asset, to enable us to focus our resources on the development of CD388. We entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or Napp Purchase Agreement, with Napp Pharmaceutical Group Limited, or Napp, an affiliate of Mundipharma Medical Company, or Mundipharma, our licensee for the asset in all territories other than the U.S. and Japan, pursuant to which we sold to Napp all of our rezafungin assets, including our right to receive future milestones and royalties under the License Agreement between us and Melinta Therapeutics, LLC, or Melinta (our U.S. licensee), or the Melinta License Agreement, and the License and Collaboration Agreement between us and Mundipharma, or the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement.
Following these transactions, our sole R&D focus has now shifted to our proprietary Cloudbreak platform, which enables the development of novel DFCs that inhibit specific disease targets while simultaneously engaging the immune system. With the reacquisition of CD388, it is now our most advanced DFC program. CD388 is a highly potent antiviral designed to deliver universal prevention and treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza.
In November 2024, we completed a private placement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 3,892,274 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,149,035 shares of common stock to certain institutional and other accredited investors, or the November 2024 Private Placement. The November 2024 Private Placement provided $105.0 million in gross proceeds.
Cloudbreak Platform
We believe our Cloudbreak platform has the potential to offer a fundamentally new approach to treat and prevent serious diseases such as viral infections and solid tumors, by developing product candidates designed to provide potent disease targeting activity and immune system engagement in a single long-acting molecule. Because serious disease often results when a pathogen or cancer cell evades or overcomes the host immune system, our Cloudbreak DFC candidates are designed to counter diseases in two ways: prevention of disease proliferation and immune evasion by directly targeting and, where applicable, by focusing the immune system on a pathogen or infected cell. We believe this is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current therapies, including antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, monoclonal or multi-specific antibodies and vaccines.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
In addition, DFCs are designed to have several advantages, including:
•
Multivalent binding which has the potential to increase potency;
•
Ability to engage different targets to serve as a “drug cocktail” in a single molecule, which may improve response to treatment and prevention; and
•
Potential advantages over vaccines irrespective of the immune status of patients.
DFCs are fundamentally different from ADCs: DFCs are biologically stable drug-Fc conjugates designed to engage extracellular targets, while ADCs are designed to enter target cells to deliver and release cytotoxic small molecule drugs. In contrast to ADCs and monoclonal antibodies, DFCs are smaller, providing the potential for better tissue penetration and targeting multiple sites. Unlike small molecules, we believe DFC optimization can be focused primarily on potency.
Our lead Cloudbreak candidate for the prevention of influenza is CD388, a highly potent antiviral designed to deliver universal prevention and treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our lead oncology DFC is CBO421, a development candidate targeting CD73 for the treatment of solid tumors, which received investigational new drug application, or IND, clearance in July 2024. We do not plan to initiate clinical trials for any oncology product candidates at this time but continue business development discussions for our oncology DFC programs, including CBO421.
Cloudbreak Influenza Program (CD388)
We have completed two Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2a study of CD388, our influenza DFC:
•
A randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intramuscular and subcutaneous administration of CD388 in healthy subjects (NCT05285137);
•
A separate Phase 1 Japanese bridging study (NCT05619536); and
•
A Phase 2a study (NCT05523089) to evaluate the pre-exposure prophylactic activity of CD388 against influenza.
We initiated the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study in September 2024.
In December 2022, we received the first U.S. patent for CD388. The patent includes claims directed to the composition of matter of CD388. The patent is projected to expire in 2039 plus any available patent term extension.
In June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Fast Track designation to CD388 for the prevention of influenza A and B infection in adults who are at high risk of influenza complications due to underlying immunodeficiency and may not mount an adequate response to influenza vaccine or are at high risk of severe influenza despite influenza vaccination, including those for whom vaccines are contraindicated. Fast Track designation aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions with unmet medical needs. The purpose is to get important new drugs to patients earlier. Companies that are granted this designation are given the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA, and, if relevant criteria are met, eligibility for Priority Review.
Final CD388 Phase 1 and Phase 2a Results
On September 21, 2023, we announced efficacy and safety data from our Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies evaluating the pre-exposure prophylactic activity of CD388 against an H3N2 influenza A virus strain.
CD388 was well-tolerated up to 900 milligrams, or mg (maximum dose tested):
In total, 108 subjects were dosed in our Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies, 84 of which were dosed subcutaneously, or SQ, and 24 were dosed intramuscularly, or IM.

As shown above, despite the small sample size in this analysis, a decrease in viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and influenza infection was observed in participants receiving a single dose of CD388 when compared to placebo. No treatment emergent adverse events leading to study discontinuation or SAEs were reported in the analysis. All participants included in the analysis received either CD388 or placebo and were then challenged with influenza five days later.

CD388 Phase 2a and Phase 1 Data Presentations at 34th European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) conference:
In April 2024, we presented data from the Phase 2a study of CD388 in various poster presentations at the 34th ESCMID conference. The first presentation showed CD388 was well-tolerated and demonstrated statistically significant antiviral effects when administered as a single subcutaneous dose in healthy volunteers challenged with influenza. The second presentation highlighted data from a Phase 1 single ascending dose study of CD388 which showed the drug has an extended half-life of 6-8 weeks. These data underscore the potential of CD388 to provide patients with seasonal influenza prevention.
CD388 Phase 2a and Phase 1 Data Presentations at the Options XII conference:
In October 2024, we presented data from the Phase 2a study and the two Phase 1 studies. The first presentation was an oral presentation and showed the comprehensive safety data from all completed studies in the CD388 development program, demonstrating that CD388 appears to be well-tolerated at single doses up to 900 mg and repeat doses up to 450 mg. The second presentation was a poster presentation of the Phase 1 Japanese Bridging study that demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of CD388 were similar between Japanese and Western participants and required no dose changes.
CD388 Phase 2a and Phase 1 Data Presentations at the ID Week conference:
In October 2024, we presented additional data from the Phase 2a study and the Phase 1 First-in-Human study. The first presentation was an oral presentation that showed that among those participants who had serology confirmation of influenza infection in the Phase 2a study the rates of symptomatic clinical influenza and viral load AUC were significantly lower for CD388 participants versus placebo participants. The second presentation was a poster presentation that showed comprehensive safety and pharmacokinetic data from the First-in-Human Phase 1 study. This poster demonstrated that a single dose of CD388 should be sufficient to last through an entire influenza season and the lack of hypersensitivity or anti-drug antibodies with repeat dosing of CD388.
Peer-reviewed Manuscript on CD388 Preclinical Data Accepted for Publication:
A peer-reviewed manuscript describing the design and preclinical characterization of CD388 has been accepted for publication and is expected to appear in print in the first half of 2025. The manuscript highlights the potent, universal antiviral activity of CD388 in cell-based assays and lethal mouse infection models, and low potential for resistance development.

CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE Study Timeline
We initiated the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study during the 2024-25 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, with dosing of the first subjects on September 20, 2024. The CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial with single doses of CD388 or placebo administered at the beginning of the influenza season with subjects followed for the influenza season to monitor for breakthrough cases of influenza. The primary endpoint of this study will compare the rates of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza between different single dose levels of CD388 and placebo over an influenza season. The patient population in this study will be healthy adults who have not received an influenza vaccination for the upcoming season. In December 2024, we announced that we had reached full planned enrollment of at least 5,000 subjects across clinical trial sites in the United States and the United Kingdom. Topline data is expected in the third quarter of 2025. Given the severity of the 2024-25 flu season, we may consider a potential early analysis of efficacy data from the ongoing CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study in the first half of 2025. If an analysis of the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study is completed in the first half of 2025, such results will be disclosed and we may consider initiating a Phase 3 study during the 2025-26 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Refer to other risks described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cloudbreak Oncology Programs
We have expanded the Cloudbreak platform beyond infectious diseases, to discover and develop highly potent DFCs that can target single or multiple immune checkpoint pathways for the treatment of solid tumors.
Immune checkpoint antagonists have generated durable responses in cancers with improved side effect profiles compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, improved outcomes from existing therapies have been limited to a small subset of patients. To broaden the response rate to more patients, targeting additional mechanisms of tumor immune evasion will be critical.
Using Cloudbreak, we seek to develop a new generation of immunotherapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. Our lead oncology DFC candidate, CBO421, is a highly differentiated CD73 inhibitor that combines the strengths of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies targeting CD73. CBO421 targets CD73 in the adenosine pathway, which contributes to immune evasion in solid cancers by flooding the tumor microenvironment with adenosine, a potent immune cell suppressor. The CD73 pathway is clinically validated in early/mid-stage clinical studies to reduce tumor growth in combination with PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors in disease areas that do not historically respond to checkpoint inhibition alone, such as triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and other solid tumors. As a monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 inhibitors, CBO421 has demonstrated activity and formation of immunologic memory in multiple murine tumor models, along with differentiated activity in T-cell reactivation assays and tumor penetration compared with the most advanced CD73 antibody therapeutics in clinical development. CBO421 received IND clearance in July 2024.
Cloudbreak Oncology Pipeline:
We do not plan to initiate clinical trials for any oncology product candidates at this time but continue business development discussions for our oncology DFC programs, including CBO421.

OUR STRATEGY
Our objective is to become the leading biotechnology company in the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted therapies designed to save lives and improve the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases. Key elements of our strategy include:
•
Develop and commercialize our lead clinical-stage asset CD388, a DFC intended for influenza prophylaxis. 
On September 23, 2024, we announced the first subjects dosed in the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD388 for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of influenza during the 2024-25 flu season and on December 4, 2024, announced that the study had reached its full planned enrollment of at least 5,000 subjects. Topline data is expected in the third quarter of 2025. Given the severity of the 2024-25 flu season, we may consider a potential early analysis of efficacy data from the ongoing CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study in the first half of 2025. If an analysis of the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study is completed in the first half of 2025, such results will be disclosed and we may consider initiating a Phase 3 study during the 2025-26 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, preliminary cumulative estimated flu disease burden for the 2024-25 flu season observed as of January 18, 2025, the seasonal flu virus was circulating at high levels, causing many illnesses and possibly deaths and was continuing to rise.
•
Continue business development discussions for our oncology DFC programs, including CBO421.
 Our lead oncology development candidate, CBO421, targets CD73 in the adenosine pathway. CBO421 received IND clearance in July 2024. We may fund these programs with grant or government contract funding or through new partnerships we may consider. We will also continue to establish intellectual property related to the Cloudbreak platform, its applications and development candidates.
CLOUDBREAK PLATFORM
We believe our Cloudbreak platform has the potential to offer a fundamentally new approach to treat and prevent serious diseases such as solid tumor cancers and viral infections, by developing product candidates designed to provide potent disease targeting activity and immune system engagement in a single long-acting molecule. Because serious disease often results when a pathogen or cancer cell evades or overcomes the host immune system, our Cloudbreak DFC candidates are designed to counter diseases in two ways: prevention of disease proliferation or immune evasion by directly targeting and, where applicable, by focusing the immune system on a pathogen or infected cell. We believe this is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current therapies, including ADCs, monoclonal or multispecific antibodies and vaccines.
In addition, DFCs are designed to have several advantages, including:
•
Multivalent binding which has the potential to increase potency;
•
Ability to engage different targets to serve as a “drug cocktail” in a single molecule, which may improve response to treatment and prevention; and

In contrast to ADCs and monoclonal antibodies, DFCs are smaller, providing the potential for better tissue penetration and are designed to target multiple sites. Unlike small molecules, we believe DFC optimization can be focused primarily on potency.
The Cloudbreak platform has enabled us to expand the development of DFCs to target other life-threatening diseases. We have expanded the Cloudbreak platform beyond infectious diseases to discover and develop highly potent DFCs that can target multiple immune checkpoint pathways within a single DFC for oncologic indications.
Cloudbreak candidates targeting solid tumor cancers and viral infections are called DFCs, single molecules consisting of two distinct moieties with discrete, yet complementary mechanisms of action:
•
Targeting Moiety (TM): A highly potent small molecule and/or peptide that binds surface targets on the pathogen or host cell to directly inhibit viral proliferation.
•
Effector Moiety (EM): A proprietary composition that contains the fragment crystallizable, or Fc, region of human IgG1 antibodies, which was selected to extend half-life engagement and engage the human immune system via Fc-gamma receptors.
DFCs not only mediate pathogen clearance through a multimodal mechanism of action but also have potential for months of activity with a single dose.

Cloudbreak DFC (drug-Fc conjugate) Program Overview
We are leveraging the Cloudbreak platform to address multiple diseases. Each DFC targets a serious disease, focused on solid tumor cancers and viral infections. Our DFC research and development programs include:
•
Influenza; and
•
Cancer (solid tumors).
DFCs provide direct, sustained antiviral activity as well as immune system engagement, for effective prevention and treatment of disease. This is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current approaches. DFCs are not vaccines, small-molecule drugs, or monoclonal antibodies. DFCs are novel, Fc-conjugates designed for the following features:
•
Multimodal mechanism of action: Potent, direct antiviral activity and tunable immune system engagement.
•
Strong target binding: High affinity to essential, conserved targets on the virus surface and/or cell surface.
•
Long duration of action: Months of protection from disease with a single dose.
•
Rapid onset: Rapid distribution to site of infection for treatment of disease.
Cloudbreak Influenza Program and Our DFC Development Candidate CD388
Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. The influenza virus can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Young children, adults older than 65 years, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients are more prone to infection, but even healthy people are at risk of infection with seasonal influenza. The primary preventive measure to protect against influenza is the seasonal vaccine, which remains the best mode to prevent influenza related illness, despite its limitations. However, the efficacy of the vaccine varies, with recent studies estimating that the influenza vaccine reduces the risk of influenza illness by between 38% and 62%, depending on the virus strain and age and health of the recipient, among other factors. While today’s influenza vaccines are credited with significant public health benefits and offer our current best defense, only 52% of Americans get an annual influenza vaccine. As a result, a large proportion of Americans are still at risk of getting influenza yearly. For example, during the 2018-19 influenza season, 71% did not respond to vaccination and 34,200 people died of influenza-related illness in the U.S. The estimated average annual total economic burden of influenza to the U.S. healthcare system and society is more than $11.2 billion. In years when the seasonal vaccine results in sub-optimal protection such as the 2018-19 influenza season when the CDC estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 29% in the U.S., more patients are at higher risk for serious complications resulting from influenza. Vulnerable patient populations must then rely upon therapeutic options.
Older antiviral medications, such as amantadine and rimantadine, are no longer recommended for use because of high levels of resistance. Currently, four antiviral drugs are recommended by the CDC for treating influenza:
•
oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu
®
);
•
zanamivir (Relenza
®
);
•
peramivir (Rapivab
®
); and
•
baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza™).
11
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
The above list includes neuraminidase inhibitors and the recently approved cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir. These molecules have one or more of the following limitations: short half-life; high susceptibility to resistance; multi-dose regimens; and dosing route limitations. The current therapies should be administered within 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective.
Potential Advantages of Cloudbreak DFCs for Influenza
•
Broad-Spectrum, Universal Coverage:
 Cloudbreak DFCs have demonstrated activity against pandemic and seasonal influenza A and B viruses, including resistant strains (e.g. oseltamivir-resistant H1N1, zanamivir-resistant influenza B) and strains with high pandemic potential (e.g. H5N1, H7N9).
•
Superior Resistance Profile:
 DFCs may be less prone to viral resistance, by virtue of the targeting mechanism and multivalent target engagement.
•
Protection for High-Risk Populations:
 Unlike vaccines, the potent intrinsic antiviral activity of the DFCs has demonstrated antiviral protection independent of immune system status in animal efficacy models.
•
Seasonal and Pandemic Readiness:
 DFCs are well-suited for immediate and robust response to influenza challenges by providing rapid onset of protection and coverage of strains that are frequently missed by the seasonal vaccine. Moreover, DFCs are not subject to the lengthy and unpredictable process of vaccine manufacturing.
•
Long Duration of Action:
 A single DFC dose may protect from influenza for an entire influenza season.
DFC Development Candidate for Influenza: CD388
Pre-Clinical Studies of CD388 for Influenza
We have developed a novel DFC that provides a direct and sustained antiviral effect and retains potent activity in immune compromised hosts. The results of multiple preclinical studies with CD388 indicate that it is effective in both the treatment and prevention of influenza infections. CD388 has been engineered to extend half-life and has the potential to extend the duration of protection in prophylactic applications.
In Vitro Studies Measuring CD388 Potency Against Multiple Influenza Strains
We evaluated CD388 
in vitro
 for its ability to inhibit viral replication in cell-based assays versus broad panels of seasonal and pandemic Influenza A strains, including H1N1 pandemic strains, H3N2, high pathogenicity H5N1 and H7N9 strains, oseltamivir (Tamiflu)-resistant H1N1, and influenza B strains, including zanamivir (Relenza)-resistant influenza B. CD388 showed potent activity against all the strains tested, including influenza B, which is less sensitive to oseltamivir phosphate.
In Vivo Studies Measuring CD388 Potency Against Multiple Influenza Strains in Lethal Infection Models
We evaluated CD388 
in vivo 
in lethal mouse models against multiple H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B strains. CD388 provided full protection against all strains tested with single, low doses.
In all studies, we measured the average body weights of the mice over time to support the survival data with CD388. The CD388 dosed mice maintained stable body weights over the 21-day course of the experiments demonstrating the potency of CD388 at low doses and the potency and tolerability of CD388 at high doses. In a quantitative lung burden model versus H1N1 influenza, single, low doses of CD388 demonstrated superior reduction in lung viral burden compared to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) administered daily at 10x its human equivalent dose. Unlike oseltamivir, which only minimally impacted viral burden in lung at all tested doses, viral burden in CD388 treated animals increased with dose.
In Vivo Study Evaluating CD388 as a Long-Acting Prophylactic Agent Against Influenza
We tested mean plasma concentrations of CD388 in mice and based on the long half-life we observed, we evaluated CD388 in vivo in a lethal mouse model of H1N1 by administering CD388 to the mice 7 days before lethal influenza challenge. CD388 provided 100% protection from mortality across a broad range of dose levels, demonstrating its potential suitability as a long-acting prophylactic agent for influenza prevention.
In Vitro Studies Measuring CD388 Potency Against Historical and Circulating High-Pathogenicity Influenza Strains
In cell-based microneutralization assays against historical and currently circulating high pathogenicity influenza strains, including recently identified H5N1 strains, CD388 demonstrated potent activity, superior to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).

Cloudbreak Oncology Program and Our DFC Development Candidate CBO421
We have expanded the Cloudbreak platform beyond infectious diseases, to discover and develop highly potent DFCs that can target single or multiple immune checkpoint pathways for the treatment of solid tumors.
Immune checkpoint antagonists have generated durable responses in cancers with improved side effect profiles compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, improved outcomes from existing therapies have been limited to a small subset of patients. To broaden the response rate to more patients, targeting additional mechanisms of tumor immune evasion will be critical.
Using Cloudbreak, we seek to develop a new generation of immunotherapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. Our lead oncology DFC candidate, CBO421, is a highly differentiated CD73 inhibitor that combines the strengths of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies targeting CD73. CBO421 targets CD73 in the adenosine pathway, which contributes to immune evasion in solid cancers by flooding the tumor microenvironment with adenosine, a potent immune cell suppressor. The CD73 pathway is clinically validated in early/mid-stage clinical studies to reduce tumor growth in combination with PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors in disease areas that do not historically respond to checkpoint inhibition alone, such as triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and other solid tumors. As a monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 inhibitors, CBO421 has demonstrated activity and formation of immunologic memory in multiple murine tumor models, along with differentiated activity in T-cell reactivation assays and tumor penetration compared with the most advanced CD73 antibody therapeutics in clinical development. CBO421 received IND clearance in July 2024.
We do not plan to initiate clinical trials for any oncology product candidates at this time but continue business development discussions for our oncology DFC programs, including CBO421.
LICENSE AGREEMENTS
Janssen License Agreement
On April 23, 2024, we reacquired all rights to develop and commercialize CD388 when we entered into the Janssen License Agreement, which also effectively terminated the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, which we entered into in March 2021, including the license granted by us to Janssen.
Under the Janssen License Agreement, we assumed responsibility for further clinical development, manufacture, registration and commercialization of DFCs based on our Cloudbreak platform for the prevention and treatment of influenza, including CD388 and products or compounds containing CD388. Janssen granted us an exclusive, worldwide, fee-bearing royalty-free license for certain Janssen-controller technology to develop, manufacture, and commercialize compounds and products, including CD388. Janssen agreed to (i) transfer and disclose to us certain Janssen-controlled know-how related to CD388, including manufacturing know-how, data and documentation, (ii) transfer all existing quantities of CD388 clinical materials, and (iii) transfer the cell banks used by or on behalf of Janssen for the production of CD388.
We paid Janssen an upfront payment of $85.0 million on April 24, 2024. We are also obligated to pay Janssen up to $150.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments with respect to CD388 and up to $455.0 million in commercialization milestone payments with respect to CD388. We have no obligation to pay any royalties to Janssen for future sales of any commercialized CD388 product.
MANUFACTURING
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture supplies of CD388, any other Cloudbreak development candidates, and any future product candidates. Our third-party contract manufacturers are currently producing, and will produce in the future, our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply utilizing reliable and reproducible processes and common manufacturing techniques.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, CD388, CBO421, our other DFCs, our Cloudbreak platform, our processes and our know-how are important to our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position through patent protection in the U.S. and internationally where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, obtain, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and/or potentially licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in 
13
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
protecting our inventions, improvements and technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
•
obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
•
defend and enforce our current and potential future patents;
•
preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
•
operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We have established, and will continue to build, proprietary positions for CD388, CBO421, and other product candidates and technology in the U.S. and abroad. As of March 6, 2025, our patent portfolio included eight families of patents and patent applications related to various aspects of CD388, and four families of patent applications related to various aspects of CBO421.
With respect to CD388, we received the first U.S. patent in December 2022. The patent is projected to expire in 2039 plus any available patent term extension. The latest of the issued patents and any patents that result from our currently pending applications would be expected to expire in 2044, should they be issued, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
With respect to CBO421, the latest of any patents that result from our currently pending applications would be expected to expire in 2045, should they be issued, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
Market exclusivity is the exclusive marketing right granted by the FDA and certain foreign equivalents upon the approval of a drug if certain statutory requirements are met. When granted, the applicable regulatory authority will not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication during the period of market exclusivity. The length of market exclusivity depends on the type of exclusivity granted. We intend to seek market exclusivity on our product candidates where appropriate.
Further, we seek trademark protection in the U.S. and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have filed for trademark protection in several countries for the Cidara trademark, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our pharmaceutical compounds. We currently have registered trademarks for the Cidara mark in the U.S., the EU, Australia and Canada.
COMPETITION
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that CD388 and any other Cloudbreak development candidates we pursue in the future, combined with our scientific and development expertise in the field of anti-infectives, provide us with competitive advantages over our peers. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from generic drug manufacturers, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
For certain patient populations and approved indications, we expect that CD388 will be used in conjunction with approved vaccines for influenza in order to provide additional protection. For other patient populations and approved indications, we expect that CD388 may compete with approved vaccines for influenza and approved agents for the treatment of viral influenza infections, including neuraminidase inhibitors such as Tamiflu, Relenza, and Peramivir, and endonuclease inhibitors such as Xofluza. We intend to develop other product candidates through our Cloudbreak platform for the prevention and treatment of other viral infections. We are aware of a number of approved and investigational vaccines and/or therapies in these areas. We expect that CBO421 would compete against approved anticancer therapeutics as well as investigational CD73-targeting small molecule drugs, including quemliclustat being developed by Arcus Biosciences, Inc. and monoclonal antibodies, including oleclumab being developed by AstraZeneca PLC.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our Cloudbreak platform.
14
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject enrollment for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
U.S. Drug Approval Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and biologics under the Public Health Service, or PHS, Act and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•
manufacturing of clinical supplies in compliance with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations;
•
completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
•
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•
approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
•
submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA;
•
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency; and
•
FDA review and approval of the BLA.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as 
in vitro
 and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing 
15
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, including animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises safety concerns or questions related to safety to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and/or the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial conducted in the U.S. and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov
. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•
Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•
Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•
Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if SAEs occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs and clinical BLA supplements are additionally subject to a substantial application fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual program fees, which are typically increased annually.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all BLAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within ten months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months from filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a 
16
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
After the FDA’s evaluation of the BLA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction via additional information submitted to the FDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the BLA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track Designation
The FDA aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability of the sponsor to use surrogate endpoints in the evaluation of the pivotal clinical trials and have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Priority Review
Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is accepted for review. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A Fast Track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA’s criteria for priority review.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications, but it may not issue a Written Request where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which an orphan drug designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMS, as a condition of approval. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•
fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•
refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
•
consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.

Additional Health Care Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes certain requirements on covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in 
19
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of therapies in which our products are used.
There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Coverage and reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the medical circumstances under which it is used may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products or procedures or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Even if coverage is obtained for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may change. Additionally, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication.
Outside the U.S., the commercialization of therapeutics is generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has, and will continue to, put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product candidates.
Healthcare Reform
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. There have been amendments to and executive judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 
20
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the second Trump administration will impact Affordable Care Act.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2032 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, effective January 1, 2024.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. At the federal level there have been several presidential executive orders and U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. The IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs that have been on the market for at least seven years covered under Medicare, or the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions began to take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023. On August 15, 2024, HHS announced the agreed-upon reimbursement prices of the first 10 drugs that were subject to price negotiations, although the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program is currently subject to legal challenges. On January 17, 2025, HHS selected 15 additional products covered under Part D for price negotiation in 2025. Each year thereafter more Part B and Part D products will become subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. Further, on December 7, 2023, an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs through the use of march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act was announced. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the price of a product as one factor an agency can use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that will continue under the new framework. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida’s Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, proposal to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this program will be implemented, including which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the United States or Canada. Other states have also submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. Any such approved importation plans, when implemented, may result in lower drug prices for products covered by those programs.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
