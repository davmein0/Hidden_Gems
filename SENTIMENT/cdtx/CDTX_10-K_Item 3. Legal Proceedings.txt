OVERVIEW
We are a biotechnology company using our proprietary Cloudbreak
®
 platform to develop drug-Fc conjugate, or DFC, immunotherapies designed to save lives and improve the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases.
Our lead clinical-stage asset is CD388, a DFC intended for influenza prophylaxis, which we discovered and advanced to the clinic under a partnership with J&J Innovative Medicine, previously Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, or Janssen. To date, we have completed two Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2a study of CD388 under our prior license and collaboration agreement that we entered into with Janssen in March 2021, or the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. In 2023, as part of a prioritization of its research and development, or R&D, business, Janssen disclosed its intention to discontinue internal development of multiple product candidates in its infectious disease pipeline, including CD388. Through a competitive process, we reacquired all rights to develop and commercialize CD388 by executing a license and technology transfer agreement with Janssen, or the Janssen License Agreement, in April 2024. Under the terms of the Janssen License Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide, fee-bearing but royalty-free license under certain Janssen-controlled technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds, including CD388.
Concurrent with the CD388 reacquisition, we completed a private placement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 240,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock to certain institutional and other accredited investors, or the April 2024 Private Placement, which was led by RA Capital Management, with significant participation from Bain Capital Life Sciences, Biotech Value Fund, or BVF, and Canaan Partners. The April 2024 Private Placement provided $240.0 million in gross proceeds, of which we used $85.0 million to fund the upfront payment under the Janssen License Agreement. The remainder of the gross proceeds of $155.0 million are being utilized to develop CD388 as a universal preventative against seasonal and pandemic influenza A and B, beginning with the current CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study that we initiated in September 2024. We believe the reacquisition of CD388 is transformational for Cidara and potentially for those who could benefit from a long-acting, universal preventative against known forms of influenza.
In addition, in April 2024 we simultaneously divested rezafungin, our sole non-Cloudbreak asset, to enable us to focus our resources on the development of CD388. We entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or Napp Purchase Agreement, with Napp Pharmaceutical Group Limited, or Napp, an affiliate of Mundipharma Medical Company, or Mundipharma, our licensee for the asset in all territories other than the U.S. and Japan, pursuant to which we sold to Napp all of our rezafungin assets, including our right to receive future milestones and royalties under the License Agreement between us and Melinta Therapeutics, LLC, or Melinta (our U.S. licensee), or the Melinta License Agreement, and the License and Collaboration Agreement between us and Mundipharma, or the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement.
Following these transactions, our sole R&D focus has now shifted to our proprietary Cloudbreak platform, which enables the development of novel DFCs that inhibit specific disease targets while simultaneously engaging the immune system. With the reacquisition of CD388, it is now our most advanced DFC program. CD388 is a highly potent antiviral designed to deliver universal prevention and treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza.
In November 2024, we completed a private placement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 3,892,274 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,149,035 shares of common stock to certain institutional and other accredited investors, or the November 2024 Private Placement. The November 2024 Private Placement provided $105.0 million in gross proceeds.
Cloudbreak Platform
We believe our Cloudbreak platform has the potential to offer a fundamentally new approach to treat and prevent serious diseases such as viral infections and solid tumors, by developing product candidates designed to provide potent disease targeting activity and immune system engagement in a single long-acting molecule. Because serious disease often results when a pathogen or cancer cell evades or overcomes the host immune system, our Cloudbreak DFC candidates are designed to counter diseases in two ways: prevention of disease proliferation and immune evasion by directly targeting and, where applicable, by focusing the immune system on a pathogen or infected cell. We believe this is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current therapies, including antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, monoclonal or multi-specific antibodies and vaccines.
In addition, DFCs are designed to have several advantages, including:
•
Multivalent binding which has the potential to increase potency;
•
Ability to engage different targets to serve as a “drug cocktail” in a single molecule, which may improve response to treatment and prevention; and
•
Potential advantages over vaccines irrespective of the immune status of patients.
DFCs are fundamentally different from ADCs: DFCs are biologically stable drug-Fc conjugates designed to engage extracellular targets, while ADCs are designed to enter target cells to deliver and release cytotoxic small molecule drugs. 
59
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
In contrast to ADCs and monoclonal antibodies, DFCs are smaller, providing the potential for better tissue penetration and targeting multiple sites. Unlike small molecules, we believe DFC optimization can be focused primarily on potency.
Our lead Cloudbreak candidate for the prevention of influenza is CD388, a highly potent antiviral designed to deliver universal prevention and treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our lead oncology DFC is CBO421, a development candidate targeting CD73 for the treatment of solid tumors, which received investigational new drug application, or IND, clearance in July 2024. We do not plan to initiate clinical trials for any oncology product candidates at this time but continue business development discussions for our oncology DFC programs, including CBO421.
Cloudbreak Influenza Program (CD388)
We have completed two Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2a study of CD388, our influenza DFC:
•
A randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intramuscular and subcutaneous administration of CD388 in healthy subjects (NCT05285137);
•
A separate Phase 1 Japanese bridging study (NCT05619536); and
•
A Phase 2a study (NCT05523089) to evaluate the pre-exposure prophylactic activity of CD388 against influenza.
We initiated the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study in September 2024.
In December 2022, we received the first U.S. patent for CD388. The patent includes claims directed to the composition of matter of CD388. The patent is projected to expire in 2039 plus any available patent term extension.
In June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Fast Track designation to CD388 for the prevention of influenza A and B infection in adults who are at high risk of influenza complications due to underlying immunodeficiency and may not mount an adequate response to influenza vaccine or are at high risk of severe influenza despite influenza vaccination, including those for whom vaccines are contraindicated. Fast Track designation aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions with unmet medical needs. The purpose is to get important new drugs to patients earlier. Companies that are granted this designation are given the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA, and, if relevant criteria are met, eligibility for Priority Review.
Final CD388 Phase 1 and Phase 2a Results
On September 21, 2023, we announced efficacy and safety data from our Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies evaluating the pre-exposure prophylactic activity of CD388 against an H3N2 influenza A virus strain.
CD388 was well-tolerated up to 900 milligrams, or mg (maximum dose tested):
In total, 108 subjects were dosed in our Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies, 84 of which were dosed subcutaneously, or SQ, and 24 were dosed intramuscularly, or IM.

As shown above, despite the small sample size in this analysis, a decrease in viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and influenza infection was observed in participants receiving a single dose of CD388 when compared to placebo. No treatment emergent adverse events leading to study discontinuation or SAEs were reported in the analysis. All participants included in the analysis received either CD388 or placebo and were then challenged with influenza five days later.
Viral culture data from Phase 2a Human Challenge Study confirmed efficacy seen in early analyses:
CD388 Phase 2a and Phase 1 Data Presentations at 34th European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) conference:
In April 2024, we presented data from the Phase 2a study of CD388 in various poster presentations at the 34th ESCMID conference. The first presentation showed CD388 was well-tolerated and demonstrated statistically significant antiviral effects when administered as a single subcutaneous dose in healthy volunteers challenged with influenza. The second presentation highlighted data from a Phase 1 single ascending dose study of CD388 which showed the drug has an extended half-life of 6-8 weeks. These data underscore the potential of CD388 to provide patients with seasonal influenza prevention.
CD388 Phase 2a and Phase 1 Data Presentations at the Options XII conference:
In October 2024, we presented data from the Phase 2a study and the two Phase 1 studies. The first presentation was an oral presentation and showed the comprehensive safety data from all completed studies in the CD388 development program, demonstrating that CD388 appears to be well-tolerated at single doses up to 900 mg and repeat doses up to 450 mg. The second presentation was a poster presentation of the Phase 1 Japanese Bridging study that demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of CD388 were similar between Japanese and Western participants and required no dose changes.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
CD388 Phase 2a and Phase 1 Data Presentations at the ID Week conference:
In October 2024, we presented additional data from the Phase 2a study and the Phase 1 First-in-Human study. The first presentation was an oral presentation that showed that among those participants who had serology confirmation of influenza infection in the Phase 2a study the rates of symptomatic clinical influenza and viral load AUC were significantly lower for CD388 participants versus placebo participants. The second presentation was a poster presentation that showed comprehensive safety and pharmacokinetic data from the First-in-Human Phase 1 study. This poster demonstrated that a single dose of CD388 should be sufficient to last through an entire influenza season and the lack of hypersensitivity or anti-drug antibodies with repeat dosing of CD388.
Peer-reviewed Manuscript on CD388 Preclinical Data Accepted for Publication:
A peer-reviewed manuscript describing the design and preclinical characterization of CD388 has been accepted for publication and is expected to appear in print in the first half of 2025. The manuscript highlights the potent, universal antiviral activity of CD388 in cell-based assays and lethal mouse infection models, and low potential for resistance development.
CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE Study Timeline
We initiated the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study during the 2024-25 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, with dosing of the first subjects on September 20, 2024. The CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial with single doses of CD388 or placebo administered at the beginning of the influenza season with subjects followed for the influenza season to monitor for breakthrough cases of influenza. The primary endpoint of this study will compare the rates of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza between different single dose levels of CD388 and placebo over an influenza season. The patient population in this study will be healthy adults who have not received an influenza vaccination for the upcoming season. In December 2024, we announced that we had reached full planned enrollment of at least 5,000 subjects across clinical trial sites in the United States and the United Kingdom. Topline data is expected in the third quarter of 2025. Given the severity of the 2024-25 flu season, we may consider a potential early analysis of efficacy data from the ongoing CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study in the first half of 2025. If an analysis of the CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study is completed in the first half of 2025, such results will be disclosed and we may consider initiating a Phase 3 study during the 2025-26 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Refer to other risks described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cloudbreak Oncology Programs
We have expanded the Cloudbreak platform beyond infectious diseases, to discover and develop highly potent DFCs that can target single or multiple immune checkpoint pathways for the treatment of solid tumors.
Immune checkpoint antagonists have generated durable responses in cancers with improved side effect profiles compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, improved outcomes from existing therapies have been limited to a small subset of patients. To broaden the response rate to more patients, targeting additional mechanisms of tumor immune evasion will be critical.
Using Cloudbreak, we seek to develop a new generation of immunotherapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. Our lead oncology DFC candidate, CBO421, is a highly differentiated CD73 inhibitor that combines the strengths of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies targeting CD73. CBO421 targets CD73 in the adenosine pathway, which contributes to immune evasion in solid cancers by flooding the tumor microenvironment with adenosine, a potent immune cell suppressor. The CD73 pathway is clinically validated in early/mid-stage clinical studies to reduce tumor growth in combination with PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors in disease areas that do not historically respond to checkpoint inhibition alone, such as triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and other solid tumors. As a monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 inhibitors, CBO421 has demonstrated activity and formation of immunologic memory in multiple murine tumor models, along with differentiated activity in T-cell reactivation assays and tumor penetration compared with the most advanced CD73 antibody therapeutics in clinical development. CBO421 received IND clearance in July 2024.

We do not plan to initiate clinical trials for any oncology product candidates at this time but continue business development discussions for our oncology DFC programs, including CBO421.
Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements and Reverse Stock Split
Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which has as one of its continued listing requirements a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share, or the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On November 9, 2023, we received a notification letter, or the Notice, from the Listing Qualification Staff, or the Staff, of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, advising us that for 30 consecutive trading days preceding November 6, 2023, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. As a result of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, or the Panel, imposing the previously disclosed Panel Monitor on us until November 9, 2023 pursuant to the February 9, 2023 Hearings Decision of the Panel, we were not eligible for a compliance period and the Staff notified us that this matter served as a basis for delisting our securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market.
On November 16, 2023, we requested a hearing before the Panel, which stayed any delisting action in connection with the Notice and allowed the continued listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the Panel renders a decision subsequent to the hearing. On January 12, 2024, we submitted a pre-hearing submission in which we presented a plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and request that the Panel allow us additional time within which to regain compliance.
The hearing was conducted on February 1, 2024, and on February 8, 2024, the Panel granted our request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, pursuant to an extension, through May 7, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The extension is subject to certain specified conditions and our submission of certain interim updates to the Panel.
At our special meeting of stockholders held on April 4, 2024, our stockholders approved a proposal to (i) amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock at a ratio in the range of 1-for-10 to 1-for-30, inclusive; and (ii) if and only if the reverse stock split is approved and implemented, a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock, at a ratio that is equal to half of the reverse stock split ratio, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of our board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion.
On April 12, 2024, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20, or the Reverse Stock Split. Our board of directors also approved a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock, at a ratio that is equal to half of the Reverse Stock Split ratio. On April 22, 2024, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the Charter Amendment, to effect the Reverse Stock Split. The Charter Amendment became effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 23, 2024. Our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened on April 24, 2024 under a new CUSIP number (171757206).
On May 14, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff notifying us that we had regained compliance with Nasdaq’s requirements for continued listing. In addition, the Panel imposed a discretionary Panel monitor until May 14, 2025, such that if we fail to maintain compliance with any continued listing requirement during such period, the Staff will issue a delist determination letter and we will promptly schedule a new hearing before the Panel to address such noncompliance.

Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions
Our business is subject to various trends, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to cause our reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. We may be impacted by broader macroeconomic conditions, including global pandemics, inflation, bank failures, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, recession risks, the recent presidential election in the U.S., potential tariffs and potential disruptions from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions and the active conflicts in the Middle East. The stock market, and in particular the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks, has recently experienced significant decreases in value. This volatility and valuation decline have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance.
Common Stock Equivalents Outstanding
As of December 31, 2024, we had 10,946,635 shares of common stock outstanding, 204,725 shares of Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock outstanding, which are convertible into 14,330,750 shares of common stock, 2,104,472 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding, which are convertible into 1,052,236 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase up to 866 shares of our common stock outstanding, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,149,035 shares of our common stock outstanding, and outstanding stock options and restricted stock units covering 2,481,011 shares of our common stock for a total of 31,960,533 shares of common stock equivalents outstanding.
Liquidity Overview
We have a limited operating history and the sales and income potential of our business and market are unproven. We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $611.3 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. Successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure.
At December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $196.2 million, which we expect will provide sufficient liquidity for a period of at least one year following the date that our consolidated financial statements are issued as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our ability to execute our current business plan depends on our ability to obtain additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, or potential licensing or collaboration arrangements. We may not be able to raise additional funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise funds as and when needed will compromise our ability to execute our business plan.
We plan to continue to fund our losses from operations through cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, as well as through future equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, or potential licensing or collaboration arrangements. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if we raise additional capital, we may also be required to modify, delay or abandon some of our plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.
FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW
Revenues
We have generated all of our revenues from our strategic partnership with Janssen. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of license fees and other upfront payments, other funded R&D agreements, milestone payments, product sales, government and other third-party funding and royalties in connection with strategic alliances. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of our achievement of nonclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones, the timing and amount of payments relating to such milestones and the extent to which our products are approved and successfully commercialized.
If we are unable to fund our development costs or we are unable to develop product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenues and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.
65
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Acquired In-process Research and Development Expenses
Acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, expenses include consideration for the purchase of IPR&D through asset acquisitions and license agreements as well as payments made in connection with asset acquisitions and license agreements upon the achievement of development milestones.
We evaluate license agreements for IPR&D projects to determine if it meets the definition of a business and thus should be accounted for as a business combination. If the license agreement for IPR&D does not meet the definition of a business and the assets have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use, we expense payments made under such license agreements as acquired IPR&D expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In those cases, payments for milestones achieved and payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred. Payments made in connection with regulatory and sales-based milestones will be capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue.
Research and development expenses
Our R&D expenses have related primarily to nonclinical and clinical development of our Cloudbreak platform. R&D expenses consist of wages, benefits and stock-based compensation for R&D employees, as well as the cost of scientific consultants, facilities and overhead expenses, laboratory supplies, manufacturing expenses in preclinical development and certain manufacturing expenses before FDA approval, and nonclinical and clinical trial costs. We accrue clinical trial expenses based on work performed, which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment, completion of studies or other activities within studies and other events.
R&D costs are expensed as incurred and costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. We accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the study or project and the invoices received from our external service providers. We adjust our accruals as actual costs become known.
R&D activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. However, it is difficult to determine with certainty the duration, costs and timing to complete our current or future nonclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates.
The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•
the number of sites included in the trials;
•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory authorities;
•
the duration of patient follow-up;
•
the phase of development of the product candidate; and
•
the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates.
R&D expenses by major program or category for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, were as follows (in thousands):

We typically deploy our employees, consultants and infrastructure resources across our programs. Thus, some of our R&D expenses are not attributable to an individual program but are included in other R&D expenses as shown above.
In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate’s commercial potential.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative, or G&A, expenses relate to finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. G&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, legal, business development, commercial planning, and support functions. Other G&A expenses include facility and overhead costs not otherwise included in R&D expenses, consultant expenses, travel expenses, professional fees for auditing, tax, legal, and other services.
Other income, net
Other income, net consists primarily of interest income and expense, and various income or expense items of a non-recurring nature. We earn interest income from interest-bearing accounts and money market accounts for cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Interest expense represents interest on finance lease liabilities.
Discontinued Operations
On April 24, 2024, we entered into the Napp Purchase Agreement with Napp, pursuant to which we sold to Napp all of our rezafungin assets and related contracts. We completed all conditions of the sale on April 24, 2024. We determined that the sale of rezafungin represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the sale of rezafungin is classified as discontinued operations.
We present discontinued operations when there is a disposal of a component or a group of components that represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results. The results from discontinued operations of the rezafungin assets prior and subsequent to its sale are presented as net income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented, including the loss on disposal of discontinued operations recognized during the second quarter of 2024. The assets and liabilities for the rezafungin operations related activities prior and subsequent to its sale have been classified as discontinued operations and segregated for all periods presented in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon financial statements that we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. Historically, revisions to our estimates have not resulted in a material change to our financial statements. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
Revenue Recognition 
We recognize revenue in accordance with 
Accounting Standards Codification
, or ASC, 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or ASC 606, which applies to all contracts with customers, except for elements of certain contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step 
67
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or service we transfer to a customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and identify those that are performance obligations, and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
In a contract with multiple performance obligations, we must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligation. The estimation of the stand-alone selling price(s) may include estimates regarding forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied at a point in time or over time. Any change made to estimated progress towards completion of a performance obligation and, therefore, revenue recognized will be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.
Collaboration Revenue
If a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in a contract, we recognize revenues from the transaction price allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from the allocated transaction price. We evaluate the measure of progress at each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue or expense recognition as a change in estimate.
At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our or a collaboration partner’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of milestones that are within our or a collaboration partner’s control, such as operational development milestones and any related constraint, and, if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which will affect collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Revisions to our estimate of the transaction price may also result in negative collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including commercial milestone payments based on the level of sales, and a license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied, or partially satisfied.
See Note 7 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Preclinical and Clinical Trial Accruals
We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Our accrued expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials are based on estimates of costs incurred and fees that may be associated with services provided by contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical trial investigational sites and other clinical trial-related activities. Payments under certain contracts with such parties depend on factors such as successful enrollment of patients, site initiation and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing for these services, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If possible, we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from these service providers. However, we may be required to estimate these services based on other information available to us. If we underestimate or overestimate the activities or fees associated with a study or service at a given point in time, adjustments to R&D expenses may be necessary in future periods. Historically, our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred. Subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals.

Collaboration revenue
Collaboration revenue was $1.3 million and $23.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and related to the achievement of milestones and ongoing R&D and clinical supply services provided to Janssen under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. The Janssen Collaboration Agreement was terminated upon the effectiveness of the Janssen License Agreement on April 24, 2024.
Acquired in-process research and development expenses
Acquired IPR&D expenses were $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and related to an upfront payment of $85.0 million paid to Janssen under the Janssen License Agreement, on April 24, 2024, plus $0.4 million in direct transaction costs, offset by a settlement gain of $0.5 million to settle the preexisting Janssen Collaboration Agreement relationship.
Research and development expenses
R&D expenses were $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses is primarily due to higher expenses associated with our CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study and higher personnel costs, including $1.2 million for severance and employee benefits incurred related to a reduction in force, offset by lower nonclinical expenses associated with our Cloudbreak platform.
General and administrative expenses
G&A expenses were $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in G&A expenses is primarily due to higher audit fees, legal costs, and personnel costs.
Other income, net
Other income, net during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 related primarily to interest income generated from cash held in interest-bearing accounts, offset by interest expense on finance lease liabilities.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily the result of capitalized Internal Revenue Code, or IRC, Section 174 research and development expenditures, effective January 1, 2022, creating taxable income which can be offset with net operating losses and credits that are limited in use by IRC Sections 382 and 383. For the year ended December 31, 2023 the tax provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted primarily of state minimum taxes.
Income from discontinued operations
On April 24, 2024, we entered into the Napp Purchase Agreement with Napp, pursuant to which we sold to Napp all of our rezafungin assets and related contracts. We completed all conditions of the sale on April 24, 2024. We determined that the sale of rezafungin represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the sale of rezafungin is classified as discontinued operations.
69
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Income from discontinued operations was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and primarily consisted of revenue of $29.3 million related to sale of rezafungin assets, including sale of IP and inventory, product revenue related to shipments of REZZAYO naked vials to Mundipharma, as well as R&D and clinical supply services provided to Mundipharma and Melinta, offset by (i) cost of product revenue of $9.0 million, (ii) R&D expenses of $10.5 million associated with the rezafungin clinical trial and development costs, (iii) selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses of $7.5 million primarily associated with rezafungin-related patent costs, accrued interest and penalties for indirect taxes for rezafungin-related shipments and accrued indirect tax penalties on disposal of rezafungin, and (iv) loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $1.8 million.
Income from discontinued operations was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and primarily consisted of revenue of $40.6 million related to the achievement of milestones and R&D and clinical supply services provided to Mundipharma and Melinta, as well as product revenue related to shipments of REZZAYO naked vials to Mundipharma and Melinta, offset by (i) cost of product revenue of $1.5 million, (ii) R&D expenses of $31.8 million associated with the rezafungin clinical trial and development costs, (iii) SG&A expenses of $4.8 million primarily associated with amortization of contract costs related to obtaining the Melinta License Agreement, rezafungin-related patent costs and accrued interest and penalties for indirect taxes for rezafungin-related shipments, and (iv) income tax expense of $0.4 million.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, as well as equity financings. We have devoted our resources to funding R&D programs, including research, preclinical and clinical development activities.
Our ability to fund future operating needs will depend on a combination of equity, debt or other financing structures, potentially entering into collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties or receiving government and/or charitable grants or contracts. Our ability to raise additional capital may also be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the U.S. and worldwide from geopolitical and macroeconomic events, including global pandemics, the recent presidential election in the U.S., the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, the active conflicts in the Middle East, and bank failures. As a result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we lost our Form S-3 eligibility for primary and secondary offerings for at least 12 calendar months following the date our Annual Report on Form 10-K filing was first delinquent, or through May 1, 2025.
On April 23, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and other accredited investors named therein in connection with the April 2024 Private Placement, pursuant to which we issued and sold 240,000 shares of Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1,000 per share. The closing of the April 2024 Private Placement took place on April 24, 2024, and we received total gross proceeds of $240.0 million. As a condition to the effectiveness of the Janssen License Agreement, we paid Janssen an upfront payment of $85.0 million on April 24, 2024.
On September 9, 2024, our management, as authorized by our board of directors, approved a reduction in our workforce of 20 employees, which represented approximately 30% of our workforce, or the Reduction. The Reduction was substantially completed by November 1, 2024 and has and is expected to continue to substantially reduce our capital needs related to recurring personnel costs going forward. As a result of the Reduction, we incurred charges of approximately $1.2 million for severance payments and employee benefits included in R&D expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. We do not expect to incur additional charges related to the Reduction. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $0.1 million of these charges were unpaid and included in accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. We expect these charges to be paid during the first quarter of 2025.
On November 20, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and other accredited investors named therein, or the November 2024 Purchasers, in connection with the November 2024 Private Placement, pursuant to which we issued and sold (i) an aggregate of 3,892,274 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $14.912 per share, and (ii) in lieu of shares of common stock to certain November 2024 Purchasers, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,149,035 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $14.9119 per pre-funded warrant (representing the $14.912 per share purchase price less the exercise price of $0.0001 per pre-funded warrant share). The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance and will not expire. The closing of the November 2024 Private Placement took place on November 26, 2024, and we received total gross proceeds of $105.0 million.
On December 11, 2024, we established a standby letter of credit with our banking institution, Wells Fargo, for $6.0 million for the benefit of our indirect tax service provider, as it relates to indirect tax compliance services in various tax jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in connection with the rezafungin supply chain activities and commercial sales of REZZAYO. The letter of credit expires on November 30, 2025 and is automatically extended without amendment for an additional one-year period from the current expiration date, unless notified by us to terminate prior to 90 days from any 
70
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
expiration date. The cash held as collateral for this standby letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash and is held in an interest-bearing account.
As of December 31, 2024 we have no outstanding loan balances.
Our finance lease for lab equipment expires in January 2027. Total undiscounted finance lease payments are $0.6 million as of December 31, 2024.
Our lease with Nancy Ridge Technology Center, L.P. expires on December 31, 2026 with options for two individual two-year extensions, which have not been exercised, and remain in effect and available to us. As of December 31, 2024, we were not reasonably certain that we would exercise the extension options, and therefore did not include these options in the determination of the total lease term for accounting purposes. Total undiscounted operating lease payments were $3.4 million as of December 31, 2024.
We are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies and adverse effects of the impact of pandemics, sanctions, or other macroeconomic events may pose operational challenges in those countries. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will attempt to adjust our business plans, as appropriate, to mitigate macroeconomic risks.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with vendors for R&D activities, manufacturing, and professional services that generally provide for termination either on notice or after a notice period. Our material cash requirements include costs to conduct R&D activities associated with our Cloudbreak platform, as well as personnel and G&A support costs.

Operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to (i) a net loss of $169.8 million which included an upfront payment of $85.0 million paid to Janssen under the Janssen License Agreement on April 24, 2024, plus $0.4 million in direct transaction costs, (ii) a $10.9 million increase in prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other assets primarily associated with deposits paid to a contract research organization at the start of our CD388 Phase 2b NAVIGATE study, (iii) a $14.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, primarily associated with the collection of an $11.1 million milestone payment from Mundipharma under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement before execution of the Napp Purchase Agreement, and (iv) a $29.3 million decrease in contract liabilities primarily associated with the recognition of collaboration revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to a net loss of $22.9 million, and included $20.0 million for a milestone achieved in March 2023 under the Melinta License Agreement, which was received in April 2023, and $7.0 million for a milestone achieved in September 2023 under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, which was received in September 2023.
For all periods presented, the primary use of cash was to fund R&D activities for our product candidates, which activities and uses of cash we expect to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
Investing activities
Our investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of purchases of property and equipment.
71
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $337.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of (i) net proceeds of $239.1 million, from the sale of 240,000 shares of Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock pursuant to the April 2024 Private Placement, and (ii) net proceeds of $98.2 million from the sale of 3,892,274 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,149,035 shares of common stock pursuant to the November 2024 Private Placement, offset by payment of finance lease liabilities of $0.3 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $26.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of (i) net proceeds of $17.3 million from the sale of 554,300 shares of common stock and 286,000 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to concurrent but separate underwritten public offerings and (ii) net proceeds of $8.7 million from the sale of 311,583 shares of common stock under our controlled equity sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., after deducting placement agent fees.
Discontinued Operations
The cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated and are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The total net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations was $18.0 million and $10.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no investing or financing activities from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The increase in cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations primarily related to lower milestone payments received offset by decreased clinical, development, and manufacturing activities related to the rezafungin program during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
The absence of cash outflows from discontinued operations is expected to reduce our operating cash outflows from continuing operations given that we no longer have any future obligations related to rezafungin. The expected cash outflows for these obligations to complete the ongoing clinical trials, development activities, and manufacturing activities would have been offset by any near-term future milestones and royalties.
Operating Capital Requirements
Our ability to execute our operating plan depends on our ability to obtain additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, or potential licensing or collaboration arrangements. We plan to continue to fund our losses from operations through cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, as well as through future equity offerings, debt financings, other third party funding, or potential licensing or collaboration arrangements. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if we raise additional capital, we may also be required to modify, delay or abandon some of our plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
73
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Preclinical and Clinical Trial Accruals
Description of the Matter
As of December 31, 2024, the Company accrued $10.3 million for clinical trial accruals included in accrued liabilities. As described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Accrued expenses for clinical trials are based on estimates of costs incurred and fees that may be associated with services provided by contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical trial investigational sites and other clinical trial-related activities. The Company accrues the expenses as goods or services are used or rendered. Clinical trial site costs are accrued as patients enter and progress through the trial.
Auditing management’s accounting for clinical trial accruals is especially challenging as evaluating the progress or stage of completion of the activities under the Company’s clinical agreements is dependent upon a high volume of data from third-party service providers and internal clinical personnel, which is tracked in spreadsheets and other end user computing programs.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
To test the completeness of the Company’s clinical trial accruals, among other procedures, we obtained supporting evidence of the research and development activities performed for significant clinical trials. We corroborated the status of significant research and development activities through meetings with accounting and clinical project managers. To verify the appropriate measurement of clinical trial accruals, we compared the costs for a sample of transactions against the related invoices and contracts, and confirmed amounts incurred to-date with third-party service providers. We also examined a sample of subsequent payments to evaluate the completeness of the clinical trial accruals.
Accrued Indirect Tax Liabilities
Description of the Matter
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, prior to the sale of rezafungin, the Company’s purchases of clinical drug supplies and raw materials, inventory transfers, and sales of commercial drug product were subject to indirect tax liabilities in various jurisdictions outside of the United States. The Company evaluated the indirect taxation consequences upon the first commercial sale of REZZAYO and determined that it has a liability for indirect taxation in various tax jurisdictions outside of the United States based on its supply chain activities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $26.0 million of accrued indirect tax liabilities.
Auditing the Company’s accrued indirect tax liabilities is challenging because the indirect tax liabilities are dependent upon an accumulation of a high volume of historical information related to the Company’s supply chain and clinical supply activities and the application of various international indirect tax laws and regulations, which varied between countries.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
To test the accrued indirect tax liabilities, we performed audit procedures to test the completeness of the Company’s accrued indirect tax liabilities that included, among other procedures, inspecting evidence of supply chain activities for clinical and commercial drug supplies.  With the assistance of our indirect tax specialists, we also performed testing of management’s determination of transactions subject to indirect taxes and the indirect tax rates applied to those transactions. In addition, we performed testing of the mathematical accuracy of the underlying computation of accrued indirect tax liabilities.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. 
THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Description of Business
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc., or the Company, was originally incorporated in Delaware in December 2012 as K2 Therapeutics, Inc., and its name was changed to Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. in July 2014. The Company is a biotechnology company using its proprietary Cloudbreak
®
 platform to develop drug-Fc conjugate, or DFC, immunotherapies designed to save lives and improve the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases. The Company’s proprietary Cloudbreak platform enables development of novel DFCs that inhibit specific disease targets while simultaneously engaging the immune system.
The Company’s most advanced DFC program is CD388, a highly potent antiviral designed to deliver universal prevention and treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza, which has completed Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trials under a partnership with J&J Innovative Medicine, previously Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, or Janssen. On April 23, 2024, the Company and Janssen entered into a license and technology transfer agreement, or the Janssen License Agreement, under which the Company reacquired all rights for CD388 from Janssen to develop and commercialize CD388.
The Company formed wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cidara Therapeutics UK Limited, in England, and Cidara Therapeutics (Ireland) Limited, in Ireland, in March 2016 and October 2018, respectively, for the purpose of developing its product candidates in Europe.
Sale of Rezafungin
The Company’s first commercially approved product in the United States, or U.S., was REZZAYO
® 
(rezafungin for injection) which is indicated for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options.
On April 24, 2024, the Company and Napp Pharmaceutical Group Limited, or Napp, an affiliate of Mundipharma Medical Company, or Mundipharma, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Napp Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold to Napp all of the Company’s rezafungin assets and related contracts. The Company completed all conditions of the sale on April 24, 2024. The Company determined that the sale of rezafungin represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the sale of rezafungin is classified as discontinued operations.
The results from discontinued operations of the rezafungin assets prior and subsequent to its sale are presented as income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented, including any gain or loss recognized on closing. The assets and liabilities for the rezafungin operations related activities prior and subsequent to its sale have been classified as discontinued operations and segregated for all periods presented in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 for additional information.
Reverse Stock Split
On April 23, 2024, the Company effected the approved 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its shares of common stock, or the Reverse Stock Split. All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the number of common shares, price per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, an immaterial amount was reclassified from common stock to additional paid-in capital.
Basis of Presentation
The Company has a limited operating history and the sales and income potential of the Company’s business and market are unproven. The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception. At December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
611.3
 million. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. Successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $
196.2
 million, which the Company expects will provide sufficient liquidity to support its planned operations for a period of at least one year following the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company’s ability to execute its current business plan beyond this date depends on its ability to obtain additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, or potential licensing or collaboration arrangements. The Company may not be able to raise additional funding on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, and any failure to raise funds as and when needed will compromise the Company’s ability to execute on its business plan.
79
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
The Company plans to continue to fund its losses from operations through cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand, as well as through future equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, or potential licensing or collaboration arrangements. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to the Company. Even if the Company raises additional capital, the Company may also be required to modify, delay or abandon some of its plans which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition and the Company’s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. Any of these actions could materially harm the Company’s business, results of operations and future prospects.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate to estimated collaboration expenses related to the Company’s collaboration and license agreements, certain accruals, including those related to nonclinical and clinical activities, and the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations associated with the Company’s collaboration, license, and purchase agreements. Although the estimates are based on the Company’s knowledge of current events, comparable companies, and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Segment Information
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, which is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company views its operations and manages its business as a single reportable segment with a single operating segment as further described in the "Description of Business" in Note 1.
The Company manages research and development, or R&D, activities on a consolidated basis. The Company expects to generate future revenue from a combination of license fees and other upfront payments, funded R&D agreements, milestone payments, product sales, government and other third-party funding, and royalties, which depend on the results, regulatory approval, and timing of the successful commercialization of its product candidates.
Comprehensive loss is the measure of segment profit or loss used by CODM in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance, which is also reported on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets.
The CODM uses comprehensive loss in making decisions regarding resource allocation and evaluating financial performance.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Acquisitions
The Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen test is not met, further analysis is required to determine whether the Company has acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. Significant judgment is required in the application of the screen test to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.
Discontinued Operations
The Company presents discontinued operations when there is a disposal of a component or a group of components that represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results. The results from discontinued operations of the rezafungin assets prior and subsequent to its sale are presented as net income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented, including any gain or loss recognized on closing. The assets and liabilities for the rezafungin operations related activities prior and subsequent to its sale have been classified as discontinued operations and segregated for all periods presented in the consolidated balance sheets.
 See Note 10 for additional information.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all short-term investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.
Restricted cash consists of cash held as collateral to secure a standby letter of credit as required by certain contracts.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets to the total amount shown at the end of the applicable period in the consolidated statements of cash flows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is stated at the original invoice amount and consists of amounts due from customers related to milestones achieved, certain R&D and clinical supply costs subject to reimbursements under the collaboration and license agreements, royalties earned, product sales, and the associated indirect taxes collectible from customers. The Company records accounts receivable net of any allowances for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers and the Company considers economic factors and events or trends expected to affect future collections experience. Any allowance would reduce the net receivables to the amount that is expected to be collected. The payment history of the Company’s customers is considered in future assessments of collectability as these patterns are established over a longer period of time.
 The Company did 
no
t record any credit losses as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Property and Equipment
The Company records property and equipment at cost, which consists of laboratory equipment, computer equipment and software, office equipment, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (generally 
three
 to 
seven years
). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful life or the remaining lease term, including any renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Finance Lease
In accordance with 
Accounting Standards Codification
, or ASC, 842, 
Leases
, or ASC 842, the Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception and recognizes finance lease right-of-use assets and finance lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments at the commencement date. The implicit rate within the Company’s finance lease was determinable and therefore used in determining the present value of future payments at the commencement date. Lease agreements that have lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component.
The Company recognizes amortization of the right-of-use assets and interest on the lease liabilities for its finance lease. Finance lease right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. However, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee or the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, the right-of-use assets are amortized to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset.
Operating Lease
In accordance with ASC 842 the Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception and recognizes operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments at the commencement date. As the Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, management develops incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease agreements that have lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. The Company maintains deposits in government insured financial institutions in excess of government insured limits. The Company invests its cash balances in financial institutions that it believes have high credit quality, has not experienced any losses on such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to significant credit risk.
Patent Costs
The Company expenses all costs as incurred in connection with patent applications (including direct application fees, and the legal and consulting expenses related to making such applications) and such costs are included in general and administrative, or G&A, expenses in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
82
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
Income Taxes
The Company reports deferred income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,

Income Taxes
, or ASC 740. ASC 740 requires a company to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions pursuant to ASC 740, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the tax benefit having the highest likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the provision for income taxes.
Indirect Taxes
The Company’s purchases of clinical drug supplies and raw materials, inventory transfers, and sales of commercial drug product are subject to indirect taxation in various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Indirect tax payable is included in accrued indirect tax liabilities, the related expense is included in R&D expenses within discontinued operations, and the related interest and penalties are included in selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses within discontinued operations. Subsequent to the sale of rezafungin, the Company retained the liability as part of its continuing operations and continued interest expense is included in G&A expenses in continuing operations. The accrual is for the indirect tax incurred in various tax jurisdictions outside of the U.S. as a consequence of the Company’s supply chain activities or in connection with commercial sales of REZZAYO. To the extent that any accrued indirect taxes are determined to not be due and payable, then any associated liabilities and operating expenses will be reversed as part of continuing operations at that time. Indirect tax amounts on commercial sales (product revenue) and asset disposals that can be billed to and recovered from our customers are included in accounts receivables. Indirect tax amounts related to inventory purchases and manufacturing are included in inventory within discontinued operations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or ASC 606, which applies to all contracts with customers, except for elements of certain contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
In a contract with multiple performance obligations, the Company must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation, which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. The estimation of the stand-alone selling price(s) may include estimates regarding forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probabilities of technical and regulatory success. The Company evaluates each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied at a point in time or over time. Any change made to estimated progress towards completion of a performance obligation and, therefore, revenue recognized will be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.
Collaboration Revenue
If a license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in a contract, the Company recognizes revenues from the transaction price allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the

appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from the allocated transaction price. The Company evaluates the measure of progress at each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue or expense recognition as a change in estimate.
At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s or a collaboration partner’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of milestones that are within its or a collaboration partner’s control, such as operational development milestones and any related constraint, and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which will affect collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Revisions to the Company’s estimate of the transaction price may also result in negative collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including commercial milestone payments based on the level of sales, and a license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied, or partially satisfied.
See Note 7 and Note 10 for additional information.
Acquired In-process Research and Development Expenses
Acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, expenses include consideration for the purchase of IPR&D through asset acquisitions and license agreements as well as payments made in connection with asset acquisitions and license agreements upon the achievement of development milestones.
The Company evaluates license agreements for IPR&D projects to determine if it meets the definition of a business and thus should be accounted for as a business combination. If the license agreement for IPR&D does not meet the definition of a business and the assets have no alternative future use, the Company expenses payments made under such license agreements as acquired IPR&D expense in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In those cases, payments for milestones achieved and payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred. Payments made in connection with regulatory and sales-based milestones will be capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue.
Research and Development Costs
R&D expenses consist of wages, benefits and stock-based compensation charges for R&D employees, scientific consultant fees, facilities and overhead expenses, laboratory supplies, manufacturing expenses in preclinical development and certain manufacturing expenses before FDA approval, nonclinical and clinical trial costs, and indirect taxes on clinical supplies and development materials. The Company accrues nonclinical and clinical trial expenses based on work performed, which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment, completion of studies, and other events.
Costs incurred in purchasing technology assets and intellectual property are charged to R&D expense if the technology has not been conclusively proven to be feasible and has no alternative future use.
General and Administrative Expenses
G&A expenses relate to finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. G&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, legal, business development, commercial planning and support functions. Other G&A expenses include facility and overhead costs not otherwise included in R&D expenses, consultant expenses, travel expenses, professional fees for auditing, tax, legal, and other services, and any accrued interest and penalties on accrued indirect tax liabilities.
Preclinical and Clinical Trial Accruals
The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Accrued expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials are based on estimates of costs incurred and fees that may be associated with services provided by contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical trial investigational sites and other clinical trial-related activities. Payments under certain contracts with such parties depend on factors such as successful enrollment of patients, site initiation and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing for these services, the Company estimates the time period over which services will be performed 
84
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If possible, the Company obtains information regarding unbilled services directly from these service providers. However, the Company may be required to estimate these services based on other available information. If the Company underestimates or overestimates the activities or fees associated with a study or service at a given point in time, adjustments to R&D expenses may be necessary in future periods. Historically, estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred. Subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in accruals.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance-based RSUs, or PRSUs, and 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, rights by estimating the fair value on the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of RSUs and PRSUs granted to employees is estimated based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
The assumptions included in the Black-Scholes option pricing model include (a) the risk-free interest rate, (b) the expected volatility of the Company’s stock, (c) the expected term of the award, and (d) the expected dividend yield. The Company computed the expected volatility data using the daily close prices for the Company’s common stock during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the Company’s stock-based awards. The Company estimated the expected life of employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the yields of zero-coupon U.S. treasury securities. The expected dividend yield of 
zero
 reflects that the Company has not paid cash dividends since inception and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
For awards subject to time-based vesting conditions, including those with a graded vesting schedule, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. For performance-based awards to employees, (i) the fair value of the award is determined on the grant date, (ii) the Company assesses the probability of the individual performance milestones under the award being achieved and (iii) the fair value of the shares subject to the milestone is expensed over the implicit service period commencing once management believes the performance criteria is probable of being met.
The Company recognizes forfeitures related to stock-based compensation as they occur and any compensation cost previously recognized for awards for which the requisite service has not been completed is reversed in the period that the award is forfeited.
Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company follows the guidance in ASC 260, 
Earnings Per Share
, or ASC 260, which establishes standards regarding the computation of earnings per share, or EPS, by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of a company. The guidance requires earnings to be hypothetically allocated between the common, preferred, and other participating stockholders based on their respective rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends, whether or not declared. Participating securities include Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock, or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, and pre-funded warrants, see Note 5 for additional information. Basic net EPS is then calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders (after the reduction for any preferred stock and assuming current income for the period had been distributed) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company calculates diluted net EPS by using the more dilutive of the (1) treasury stock method, reverse treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable, or (2) the two-class method. Dilutive common stock equivalents are comprised of warrants (excluding pre-funded warrants), Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, RSUs, PRSUs and options outstanding under the Company’s stock option plans and ESPP, on an as converted basis.
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock method or if-converted method. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock as the preferred stockholders do not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses. In loss periods, basic and diluted net loss per share are identical because the otherwise dilutive potential common shares become anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded.
85
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
In accordance with ASC 260, if a company had a discontinued operation, the Company uses income (loss) from continuing operations as its control number to determine whether potential common shares are dilutive or anti-dilutive for purposes of reporting basic and diluted net earnings (loss) per common share from discontinued operations.
As discussed in Note 5, as part of its November 2024 Private Placement (as defined below), the Company issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 
3,149,035
 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $
14.9119
 per pre-funded warrant (representing the $
14.912
 per share purchase price less the exercise price of $
0.0001
 per pre-funded warrant share). Since the $
0.0001
 exercise price per pre-funded warrant share represents little consideration and is non-substantive in relation to the purchase price of $
14.9119
 per pre-funded warrant, and as the pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance with no further vesting conditions or contingencies associated with them, the shares underlying the pre-funded warrants are therefore included in the calculation of basic net loss per common share.
The following table sets forth the outstanding potentially dilutive securities that have been excluded in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share because doing so would be anti-dilutive (in common stock equivalent shares):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company follows ASC 820-10, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, or ASC 820-10, with respect to fair value reporting for financial assets and liabilities. The guidance defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. The guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. The guidance discusses valuation techniques such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, accrued compensation and benefits, and lease liabilities. The carrying amount of these financial instruments are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of their short-term nature.
Recently Issued and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 effective January 1, 2024, and included additional disclosures in Note 1. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which requires public entities to disclose disaggregated information about their effective tax rate reconciliation as well as expanded information on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The disclosure requirements will be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply them retrospectively. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this guidance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 and believes, based on its preliminary assessment, that this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. This ASU requires public business entities to disclose, for interim and annual reporting periods, additional information about certain income 
86

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
statement expense categories. The requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Entities are permitted to apply either the prospective or retrospective transition methods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The Company believes, based on its preliminary assessment, that any other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures, or do not apply to the Company.
3. 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company follows ASC 820-10, which among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
As a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions, which reflect those that a market participant would use.
The Company classifies investments in money market accounts within Level 1 as the prices are available from quoted prices in active markets.
None of the Company’s non-financial assets or liabilities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. No transfers between levels have occurred during the periods presented.
The following tables summarize the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Reverse Stock Split
On April 23, 2024, the Company effected the Reverse Stock Split of its shares of common stock and decreased its authorized number of shares of common stock from 
200,000,000
 shares to 
20,000,000
 shares.
All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the number of common shares, price per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis.
Controlled Equity Sales Agreement
In September 2019, the Company began to sell shares of common stock under a controlled equity sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, entered into on November 8, 2018 with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 
310,983
 shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $
8.7
 million after deducting placement agent fees. The Company has 
not
 sold any shares of its common stock under the Sales Agreement since July 2023. The Company will not be able to sell shares of its common stock under the Sales Agreement until at least May 1, 2025, due to the loss of its Form S-3 eligibility for primary and secondary offerings.
2023 Underwritten Public Offering
On March 7, 2023, the Company completed concurrent but separate underwritten public offerings with Cantor, the underwriter, and issued and sold 
554,300
 shares of its common stock, including the exercise in full by Cantor of their option to purchase an additional 
72,300
 shares of common stock, and 
286,000
 shares of the Company’s Series X Convertible Preferred Stock. Cantor agreed to purchase the shares of common stock at a price of $
25.34
 per share and the shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $
12.67
 per share. The total gross proceeds from the offerings, including the full exercise by Cantor of its option to purchase additional shares of common stock, were approximately $
19.5
 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The Company received total net proceeds of approximately $
17.3
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other expenses payable by the Company.
April 2024 Private Placement
On April 23, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and other accredited investors, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, in a private placement, or the April 2024 Private Placement,

 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $
1,000
 per share. The closing of the April 2024 Private Placement took place on April 24, 2024, and the Company received total gross proceeds of $
240.0
 million. The Company received total net proceeds of approximately $
239.1
 million, after deducting issuance costs payable by the Company.

 per pre-funded warrant (representing the $
14.912
 per share purchase price less the exercise price of $
0.0001
 per pre-funded warrant share). The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance and will not expire. The closing of the November 2024 Private Placement took place on November 26, 2024, and the Company received total gross proceeds of $
105.0
 million. The Company received total net proceeds of approximately $

Preferred Stock
Under the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, the Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 
10,000,000
 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. The Company had 
10,000,000
 shares of preferred stock authorized at December 31, 2024.
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 
In April 2024, the Company designated 
240,000
 shares of preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a par value of $
0.0001
 per share.
On July 18, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved, for purposes of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(b), the issuance of up to 
16,800,000
 shares of common stock upon conversion of 
240,000
 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued in the April 2024 Private Placement.
On July 19, 2024, the Company issued

 shares of common stock upon the automatic conversion of 
35,275
 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to the terms and limitations contained in the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock, including that shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be convertible if the conversion would result in a holder beneficially owning more than 
9.99
% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock as of the applicable conversion date. After conversion, the converted shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and are no longer designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2024, shares of preferred stock designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock totaled 
204,725
.
The specific terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are as follows:
Conversion: 
Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into 
70
 shares of common stock. Holders are not permitted to convert Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock if, after conversion, the holder, its affiliates, and any other person whose beneficial ownership of common stock would be aggregated with the holder’s for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, would beneficially own more than 
9.99
% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the conversion.
Dividends:
 Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive any dividends except to the extent that dividends are paid on the Company’s common stock. If dividends are paid on shares of common stock, holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to participate in such dividends on an as-if-converted basis.
Liquidation: 
Upon the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, each holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will participate pari passu with any distribution of proceeds to holders of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock and common stock.
Voting:
 Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of common stock on an as-if-converted basis on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders; provided that holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are not permitted to vote with respect to matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, to the extent that after giving effect to such action, such holder, its affiliates, and any other person whose beneficial ownership of common stock would be aggregated with the holder’s for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 16 of the Exchange Act, would beneficially own more than 
9.99
% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the action.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
The Company evaluated the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for liability or equity classification under ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
, and determined that equity treatment is appropriate as it does not meet the criteria for liability accounting. Additionally, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable for cash or other assets (i) on a fixed or determinable date, (ii) at the option of the holder, and (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within control of the Company. As such, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is recorded as permanent equity.
Series X Convertible Preferred Stock
In May 2018, the Company designated 
5,000,000
 shares of preferred stock as Series X Convertible Preferred Stock with a par value of $
0.0001
 per share.
On August 12, 2020, at the request of certain holders, 
52,241
 shares of the Company’s Series X Convertible Preferred Stock were converted to an aggregate of 
26,120
 shares of the Company’s common stock. After conversion, the converted shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and are no longer designated as Series X Convertible Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, shares of preferred stock designated as Series X Convertible Preferred Stock totaled 
4,947,759
.
The specific terms of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock are as follows:
Conversion: 
Each share of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into 
0.5
 shares of common stock. Holders are not permitted to convert Series X Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock if, after conversion, the holder, its affiliates, and any other person whose beneficial ownership of common stock would be aggregated with the holder’s for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 16 of the Exchange Act, would beneficially own more than 
9.99
% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the conversion.
Dividends:
 Holders of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive any dividends except to the extent that dividends are paid on the Company’s common stock. If dividends are paid on shares of common stock, holders of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to participate in such dividends on an as-converted basis.
Liquidation: 
Upon the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, each holder of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock will participate pari passu with any distribution of proceeds to holders of common stock.
Voting:
 Shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock will generally have 
no
 voting rights, except as required by law and except that the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series X Convertible Preferred Stock will be required to amend the terms of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock
, 
if such action would adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, or to increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the number of authorized shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock.
The Company evaluated the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock for liability or equity classification under ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
, and determined that equity treatment was appropriate because the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock did not meet the definition of liability instruments defined thereunder as convertible instruments. Additionally, the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable for cash or other assets (i) on a fixed or determinable date, (ii) at the option of the holder, and (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within control of the Company. As such, the Series X Convertible Preferred Stock is recorded as permanent equity.

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS
2024 Equity Incentive Plan, 2020 Inducement Incentive Plan and 2015 Equity Incentive Plan
In May 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved and adopted the Company’s 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2024 EIP. In July 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2024 EIP. The 2024 EIP is the successor to and continuation of the Company’s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2015 EIP, previously approved and adopted in March 2015 by the Company’s board of directors and stockholders. The 2024 EIP became effective on July 18, 2024. Upon the effectiveness of the 2024 EIP, 
no
 additional awards were or will be granted under the 2015 EIP, although all outstanding stock awards granted under the 2015 EIP continue to be governed by the terms of the 2015 EIP. Under the 2024 EIP, the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, and other awards to individuals who are employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company.
In December 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved and adopted the 2020 Inducement Incentive Plan, which was most recently amended in February 2025, or 2020 IIP. Under the 2020 IIP, the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, and other awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company, or who are returning to employment following a bona fide period of non-employment with the Company, as an inducement material to such persons entering into employment with the Company.
Terms of stock award agreements, including vesting requirements, are determined by the board of directors (or the compensation and human capital committee thereof), subject to the provisions of the 2024 EIP, 2020 IIP and 2015 EIP. Stock options granted by the Company generally vest over a 
three
- or 
four-year
 period. Certain stock options are subject to acceleration of vesting in the event of certain change of control transactions. The stock options may be granted for a term of up to 
10
 years from the date of grant. The exercise price for stock options granted under the 2024 EIP, 2020 IIP and 2015 EIP must be at a price no less than 
100
% of the fair value of the shares on the date of grant, provided that for an incentive stock option granted to an employee who at the time of grant owns stock representing more than 
10
% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, the exercise price shall be no less than 
110
% of the value on the date of grant.

SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS AND CONTRACTS
Janssen License Agreement
On April 23, 2024, the Company reacquired all rights to develop and commercialize CD388 when the Company and Janssen entered into a license and technology transfer agreement, or the Janssen License Agreement, which also effectively terminated the Janssen Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), including the license granted by the Company to Janssen.
Under the Janssen License Agreement, the Company assumed responsibility for further clinical development, manufacture, registration and commercialization of DFCs based on the Company’s Cloudbreak platform for the prevention and treatment of influenza, including CD388 and products or compounds containing CD388. Janssen granted the Company an exclusive, worldwide, fee-bearing royalty-free license for certain Janssen-controller technology to develop, manufacture, and commercialize compounds and products, including CD388. Janssen agreed to (i) transfer and disclose to the Company certain Janssen-controlled know-how related to CD388, including manufacturing know-how, data and documentation, (ii) transfer all existing quantities of CD388 clinical materials, and (iii) transfer the cell banks used by or on behalf of Janssen for the production of CD388.
The Company paid Janssen an upfront payment of $
85.0
 million on April 24, 2024. The Company is also obligated to pay Janssen up to $
150.0
 million in development and regulatory milestone payments with respect to CD388 and up to $
455.0
 million in commercialization milestone payments with respect to CD388. The Company has no obligation to pay any royalties to Janssen for future sales of any commercialized CD388 product.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
As the Company had an existing revenue contract with Janssen, or the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, the Company considered the contract modification and consideration payable to a customer guidance in ASC 606. The Company determined this bundled arrangement would be accounted for as a termination of the existing revenue contract and the creation of a new arrangement. No amounts paid or payable to Janssen were recorded against revenue as the consideration payable to Janssen does not exceed the fair value of the distinct assets acquired in the Janssen License Agreement.
In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company was determined to be the accounting acquirer and substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the IPR&D of CD388. The reacquired license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize activities of CD388 is part of the acquired IPR&D. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The acquired IPR&D did not have an alternative future use as of the acquisition date. Therefore the initial purchase price of $
85.4
 million, inclusive of $
0.4
 million in direct transaction costs, was expensed as of the acquisition date as acquired IPR&D in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Prior to the acquisition, the Company had $
0.5
 million in contract liabilities related to deferred revenue balances and unearned cancelled performance obligations associated with the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. The settlement of the preexisting contract liabilities was recorded as an offset to the Janssen License Agreement’s initial purchase price resulting in $
84.9
 million expensed as acquired IPR&D in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
The Company’s contingent future obligation to pay Janssen up to $
150.0
 million in development and regulatory milestone payments with respect to CD388 and up to $
455.0
 million in commercialization milestone payments with respect to CD388 will be recognized if and when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable.
Janssen Collaboration Agreement
On March 31, 2021, the Company and Janssen entered into the Janssen Collaboration Agreement to develop and commercialize one or more DFCs based on the Company’s Cloudbreak platform, for the prevention and treatment of influenza, including CD388 and CD377, or the Products. The effectiveness of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, including the effectiveness of the terms and conditions described below, was subject to the expiration or earlier termination of all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or HSR. HSR clearance was obtained on May 12, 2021 and the Janssen Collaboration Agreement became effective on the same date.
Collaboration
. The Company and Janssen collaborated in the research, preclinical development and early clinical development of CD388 or another mutually-agreed influenza DFC development candidate, or, in each case, the Development Candidate, under a mutually-agreed R&D plan, or the Research Plan, with the objective of advancing such Development Candidate through the completion of mutually-agreed Phase 1 clinical trials and the first Phase 2 clinical trial, or Phase 2 Study. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Company was responsible for performing, or having performed, all investigational new drug application, or IND, -enabling studies and clinical trials under the Research Plan, and the Company was the IND holder for the Research Plan clinical trials. Both parties were responsible for conducting certain specified chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, development activities under the Research Plan. Janssen was solely responsible, and reimbursed the Company, for internal full-time equivalent and out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in performing Research Plan activities in accordance with a mutually-agreed budget.
In September 2023, Janssen delivered its Election to Proceed Notice for CD388 whereby Janssen assumed the future development, manufacturing and commercialization activities of CD388 under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. The Company continued to work in collaboration with Janssen to complete the Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trials and was reimbursed for all ongoing development activities by Janssen as per the Janssen Collaboration Agreement.
Following Janssen’s Election to Proceed Notice, Janssen, was obligated at its sole expense to diligently continue development and commercialization.
Licenses
. Upon the effectiveness of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, register and commercialize Products, subject to the Company’s retained right to conduct Research Plan activities as described above. In addition, the Company granted Janssen an exclusive right of first negotiation until December 31, 2021, to negotiate and enter into a separate definitive agreement pursuant to which the parties would collaborate in the R&D of DFCs for the treatment or prevention of respiratory syncytial virus. This right of first negotiation expired on December 31, 2021.
Non-Compete Covenant
. The Company covenanted that, except for the performance of Research Plan activities, from the effectiveness of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement until the fifth anniversary of the completion of all Research Plan activities and the Company’s delivery to Janssen of all Research Plan deliverables, the Company and its affiliates will not directly or indirectly (including through any third-party contractor or through or in collaboration with any third-party licensee) develop, file any IND or application for marketing approval for, or commercialize any DFC that binds influenza or 
94
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
influenza viral proteins at therapeutic levels, except that the Company has the right to conduct limited internal research of such DFCs for the purposes of generating data to support patent filings and improving and further developing the Company’s DFC technology more broadly. The Company’s non-compete covenant described above does not apply to any DFC that demonstrates high specificity for a virus other than the influenza virus and does not possess significant activity against the influenza virus.
Financial Terms
. Upon the effectiveness of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, Janssen paid the Company an upfront payment of $
27.0
 million. As of the execution of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, the Company was eligible for reimbursement by Janssen of up to $
58.2
 million in R&D costs incurred in conducting Research Plan activities. The Company was also eligible to receive up to $
695.0
 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on tiers of annual net sales at rates from the mid-single digits to the high-single digits.
Termination
. The Janssen Collaboration Agreement was terminated upon the effectiveness of the Janssen License Agreement on April 24, 2024, and all potential future milestone payments and royalties were forfeited by the Company.
Revenue Recognition
Prior to the Janssen Collaboration Agreement termination on April 24, 2024, the Company determined the transaction price is equal to the up-front fee of $
27.0
 million, plus the R&D funding of $
47.8
 million, plus milestones achieved of $
10.0
 million. The transaction price included the total estimated costs related to R&D and clinical supply services. No revenue was reversed due to the change in transaction price as revenue is recognized based on actual amounts billed. The transaction price was allocated to the performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price estimated for each performance obligation. In estimating the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation, the Company utilized discounted cash flows and developed assumptions that required judgment and included forecasted revenues, expected development timelines, discount rates, probabilities of technical and regulatory success, costs to continue the R&D efforts and costs for manufacturing clinical supplies.
A description of the distinct performance obligations identified under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, as well as the amount of revenue allocated to each distinct performance obligation, was as follows:
Licenses of Intellectual Property.
 The license to the Company’s intellectual property, bundled with the associated know-how, represented a distinct performance obligation. The license and associated know-how was transferred to Janssen in May 2021, therefore the Company recognized the revenue related to this performance obligation in the amount of $
26.8
 million in May 2021 as collaboration revenue in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Research and Development Services.
 The R&D services performed represented a distinct performance obligation. The Company recognized revenue based on actual amounts incurred as the underlying services are provided and billed at fair value.
Clinical Supply Services.
 The Company’s initial obligation to supply drug supply for ongoing development represents a distinct performance obligation. The Company recognized revenue based on actual amounts incurred as the underlying services were provided and billed at fair value.
Milestone Payments.
 In March 2022 and September 2023, the Company achieved milestones of $
3.0
 million and $
7.0
 million, respectively, under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement that the Company deemed to be tied to all the performance obligations identified in the original agreement. Revenue associated with these milestones has been allocated proportionately to the original transaction price which was allocated to the performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price estimated for each performance obligation. In conjunction with the performance obligations already delivered, revenue was recognized based on the progress of these performance obligations, the unrecognized portion was recorded as contract liabilities at the reporting period end and was expected to be recognized as revenue over the remaining progress of these performance obligations. The Company received payment for these milestones in May 2022 and September 2023, respectively.
Royalties. 
As the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which sales-based royalties related, the Company recognized royalty revenue when the related sales occurred. 
No
 royalty revenue was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations remain in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets rather than being included in the assets and liabilities for discontinued operations, as the sale of rezafungin is structured as a sale of assets. Certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations were realized upon the sale of rezafungin assets in April 2024.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
202.8
 million and $
145.2
 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2035 and 2029, respectively, unless previously utilized. The Company also has federal R&D credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards totaling $
14.1
 million and state R&D credit carryforwards totaling $
6.2
 million. The federal R&D credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2038, unless previously utilized. The state R&D credit carryforwards have no expiration date, with the exception of an immaterial amount that will begin to expire in 2029.
At December 31, 2024, management assessed the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Due to cumulative operating losses for the three years ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of $
120.9
 million and $
83.1
 million, respectively, as management has determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized in the future. The valuation allowance increased by $
37.8
 million and $
6.4
 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Future utilization of the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation, pursuant to IRC Sections 382 and 383, as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future. An ownership change occurs when a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The Company has completed an IRC Section 382/383 analysis regarding the limitation of net operating loss and R&D credit carryforwards through 2023 and has adjusted the attributes for their estimated limitation.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition at the effective date to be recognized. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unrecognized tax benefits recorded were approximately $
12.9
 million and $
11.5
 million, respectively. Approximately $
11.0
 million of the unrecognized tax benefits would reduce the Company’s annual effective tax rates, if recognized, subject to the valuation allowance. The Company adjusted the uncertain tax position in the current year primarily related to federal and state R&D credits generated during 2024. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in thousands):

The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by the U.S. and state jurisdictions where applicable. There are currently no pending income tax examinations. The Company’s tax years from inception in 2012 are subject to examination by the federal and state tax authorities due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating losses and R&D credits. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company has not recognized interest or penalties since inception.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
From time to time, the Company may be involved in various lawsuits, legal proceedings, or claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management believes there are 
no
 claims or actions pending against the Company at December 31, 2024 which will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse

effect on its business, liquidity, financial position or results of operations. Litigation, however, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in such matters may arise from time to time that may harm the Company’s business.

Operating Lease Obligations
The Company has an operating lease for laboratory and office space in San Diego, California which was entered into in June 2014. Amendments for additional space were entered into in February 2015, March 2015 and August 2015. On April 20, 2023, the Company entered into a seventh amendment to its operating lease with Nancy Ridge Technology Center, L.P. which extended the term of the operating lease by an additional 
36
 months and increased the base rent to $
133,371
 per month effective January 1, 2024, subject to 
4
% increases every January. The operating lease expires on December 31, 2026 with options for 
two
 individual 
two-year
 extensions, as described in the original lease agreement, which have not been exercised, and remain in effect and available to the Company. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was not reasonably certain that it would exercise the extension options, and therefore did not include these options in the determination of the total operating lease term for accounting purposes. The incremental borrowing rate used in measuring the Company’s operating lease liability was

30
 days.
Contractual Obligations
The Company enters into contracts in the normal course of business with vendors for R&D activities, manufacturing, and professional services. These contracts generally provide for termination either on notice or after a notice period.
Reduction in Force
On September 9, 2024, management of the Company, as authorized by the board of directors of the Company, approved a reduction in the Company’s workforce (the “Reduction”) of 
20
 employees, which represented approximately 
30
% of the Company’s workforce. The Reduction reflects the Company’s focus on the clinical development of CD388, its influenza product candidate. The Reduction was substantially completed by November 1, 2024.
As a result of the Reduction, the Company incurred charges of approximately $
1.2
 million for severance payments and employee benefits included in R&D expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect to incur additional charges related to the Reduction. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
0.1
 million of these charges were unpaid and included in accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company expects these charges to be paid during the first quarter of 2025.
Standby Letter of Credit
On December 11, 2024, the Company established a standby letter of credit with its banking institution, Wells Fargo, for $
6.0
 million for the benefit of its indirect tax service provider, as it relates to indirect tax compliance services in various tax jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in connection with the rezafungin supply chain activities and commercial sales of REZZAYO. The letter of credit expires on November 30, 2025 and is automatically extended without amendment for an additional 
one-year
 period from the current expiration date, unless notified by the Company to terminate prior to 
90
 days from any expiration date. The cash held as collateral for this standby letter of credit is recorded as restricted cash and is held in an interest-bearing account.
10. 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On April 24, 2024, the Company and Napp, entered into the Napp Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold to Napp, effective as of April 24, 2024, the following:
•
all of the Company’s rezafungin assets, including all of the Company’s right to receive future milestones and royalties under the Melinta License Agreement and the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement,
•
all rezafungin intellectual property rights, including patents and know-how, all product data, regulatory approvals and documentation,
•
rezafungin and comparator inventory,
•
specified prepaid assets and specified contracts, in exchange for Napp’s assumption of certain liabilities of the rezafungin business, including the ongoing costs of the ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial and the ReSTORE Phase 3 clinical trial in China and the Company’s obligations from and after closing under the Melinta License Agreement,

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
•
the Commercial Supply Agreement dated January 23, 2023 between the Company and Melinta, and
•
the Commercial Supply Agreement, dated December 12, 2022 between the Company and Mundipharma, or the Mundipharma Commercial Supply Agreement.
No Company employees were transferred to Napp.
The Company, Napp and Mundipharma also entered into an Assignment and Novation Agreement to transfer the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement and Mundipharma Commercial Supply Agreement from the Company to Napp, or the Novation Agreement. In the Novation Agreement, Mundipharma agreed to forgive the Company’s obligation to refund a $
11.1
 million development milestone advance due as of December 31, 2024, net of royalties, to Mundipharma under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, provided that (a) the Company performed its obligation to provide carryover services under a Transition Services Agreement with Napp, or the TSA, for a period of 
45
 days following the closing, (b) the Company delivered all of the purchased assets, including product know-how and product-data, in accordance with the Napp Purchase Agreement and a know-how transfer plan delivered in connection with the Napp Purchase Agreement and (c) the Company performed its obligation to provide other services in accordance with the TSA for 
75
 days following the closing. If such conditions were not met, the Company was obligated to refund the development milestone advance, net of royalties, within 
10
 business days of the date on which it was determined that the conditions for forgiveness were not satisfied. On July 18, 2024, the Company received a notice of satisfaction from Mundipharma that it had completed the required performance obligations under the TSA and, accordingly, the $
11.1
 million development milestone advance previously made to the Company, and reimbursable to Mundipharma, was forgiven by Mundipharma.
In connection with the Napp Purchase Agreement and as a condition to entering into the Napp Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into an amendment, dated April 23, 2024, to the Melinta License Agreement that, among other changes, modified the future regulatory milestones payable upon receipt of marketing approval of the current rezafungin acetate product. The Melinta License Agreement, as amended, was assigned and novated to Napp at the closing of the asset sale.
The action to divest rezafungin was taken because of the Company’s strategy to streamline its portfolio and focus on the Cloudbreak platform and other financial considerations.
The Company has determined that the sale of rezafungin represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on its result of operations. Rezafungin met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations at the time of the sale. The Company has separately reported the financial results of rezafungin as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented.
Inventory
The Company began capitalizing inventory for REZZAYO, which received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in March 2023. REZZAYO (rezafungin for injection) is approved for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options. Prior to regulatory approval, all direct and indirect manufacturing costs were charged to R&D expense in the period incurred.
Inventory is comprised of raw materials and work-in-process, and includes costs related to materials, third-party contract manufacturing, freight-in and overhead. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost based on the first-in-first-out method. The Company performs an assessment of recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period based on an analysis of forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand and any firm purchase orders, as well as product shelf life, and writes down any excess, obsolete or unsaleable inventory to its estimated realizable value in the period which the required reserve is first identified. Such write downs, should they occur, are charged to cost of product revenue within discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As a result of the sale of rezafungin, all inventory has been reclassified to discontinued operations.
Cost of Product Revenue
Cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs related to materials, third-party contract manufacturing, freight-in and overhead. Prior to regulatory approval, all direct and indirect manufacturing costs were charged to R&D expense in the period incurred.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses relate to selling, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. SG&A expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, legal, business development, commercial planning and support functions. Other SG&A expenses include facility and overhead costs not otherwise included in cost of product revenue or R&D expenses, consultant expenses, travel expenses, professional fees for auditing, tax, legal, and other services, the branded prescription drug fee, and any accrued interest and penalties on accrued indirect tax liabilities.

Product Revenue
In December 2022 and January 2023, the Company entered into separate Commercial Supply Agreements with Mundipharma and Melinta Therapeutics, LLC, or Melinta, for the batch supply of REZZAYO naked vials for commercial use. Under the Commercial Supply Agreements, Mundipharma and Melinta were required to submit purchase orders to the Company for batches of REZZAYO naked vials. The Company concluded that the delivery of each batch of REZZAYO naked vials and the related quality assessment certification represented a distinct performance obligation. The Commercial Supply Agreements were terminated upon the effectiveness of the assignment to Napp on April 24, 2024.
The transaction price recognized as revenue for each performance obligation under the Commercial Supply Agreements consisted of variable consideration which was determined based on the estimated per vial costs, plus the contractually stated margin rate. The amounts recognized as revenue were adjusted, as needed, each reporting period based on actual costs incurred for each batch. Variable consideration was included in the transaction price only to the extent that it was considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration was subsequently resolved. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the transaction price any indirect taxes collected from customers. As a result, any such collections were recorded as indirect tax liabilities. The transaction price was fully allocated to the single performance obligation.
The Company concluded that the performance obligation was satisfied and product revenue was recognized when the customer obtained control of the product, which occurred at a point in time, typically upon the later of (i) completion of a positive quality assessment, or (ii) shipment of the Company’s product to the customer.
Shipping and handling activities that were performed after a customer obtained control of the product were treated as activities to fulfill the promise to a customer and any amounts billed to a customer represented revenues for the product provided. Costs related to such shipping and handling were classified as cost of product revenue.
There were 
no
 assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2024, as all balances were recognized in income from discontinued operations at the completion of the transaction. Assets and liabilities classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 consisted of the following:

Napp Purchase Agreement
In connection with the execution of the Napp Purchase Agreement, the Company modified its existing collaboration and license arrangements and Commercial Supply Agreements with Mundipharma and Melinta. As a result of the modified revenue contracts and the termination of these revenue arrangements, the Company concluded the Napp Purchase Agreement and the other aforementioned arrangements represented a bundled arrangement with a single commercial objective that required assessment under the guidance for revenue recognition. As a result, the Company identified the distinct performance obligations within the arrangements (including whether the distinct performance obligations were within the scope of ASC 606), determined the transaction price and the standalone selling prices of the distinct performance obligations, and allocated the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method to the distinct performance obligations.
103
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
Revenue Recognition
On April 24, 2024, as of the execution date of the Napp Purchase Agreement (and all other bundled arrangements), the Company determined the transaction price is equal to $
21.2
 million for the sale of all rezafungin assets, including the Company’s right to receive future milestones and royalties from Mundipharma and Melinta, all rezafungin intellectual property rights, including patents and know-how, rezafungin and comparator inventory, specified prepaid assets, the Commercial Supply Agreements with Melinta and Mundipharma, and certain transition services. The transaction price includes the forgiveness of $
25.3
 million in contract liabilities (inclusive of the $
11.1
 million development milestone advance) and $
0.6
 million for the transition services agreement. The Company paid $
2.1
 million to Napp and forgave $
2.6
 million in accounts receivable, both of which are included as a reduction to the transaction price.
The $
21.2
 million transaction price was allocated to the distinct performance obligations on the basis of their respective relative standalone selling prices.
All Rezafungin assets.
 The Company transferred all rezafungin assets, including all rezafungin intellectual property rights, including patents and know-how, rezafungin and comparator inventory in April 2024 at a point in time. Therefore, the Company recognized the revenue related to this bundled performance obligations in the amount of $
20.8
 million as revenue in the results from operations from discontinued operations.
Specified Prepaid Assets and Contracts
. The Company transferred specified prepaid and contracts in April 2024 at a point in time. The nature of the assets transferred were determined to be outside the scope of ASC 606 and therefore, the $
0.3
 million was recorded as part of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations.
Transition Services
. The Company performed its services under the TSA over the initial 
76-day
 period subsequent to the effective date of the Napp Purchase Agreement. In connection with the carryover services provided after the sale of rezafungin, the Company recognized $
0.1
 million as revenue in the results of operations from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company's costs to provide the TSA services predominantly relate to employee labor costs which are reported within R&D and SG&A expenses within the results of operations from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. The remaining unsatisfied performance obligation as of December 31, 2024 was 
zero
.
Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement
On September 3, 2019, the Company entered into the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement with Mundipharma, a related party, for a strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize rezafungin in an intravenous formulation, or the Mundipharma Licensed Product, for the treatment and prevention of invasive fungal infections.
Collaboration
. Under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, the Company was responsible for leading the conduct of an agreed global development plan, or the Global Development Plan, that included the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of the Mundipharma Licensed Product for the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis, or the ReSTORE Trial, and the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of the Mundipharma Licensed Product for the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in adult allogeneic blood and marrow transplant recipients, or the ReSPECT Trial, as well as specified GLP-compliant non‑clinical studies and CMC development activities for the Mundipharma Licensed Product. Mundipharma was responsible for performing all development activities, other than Global Development Plan activities, that were necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the Mundipharma Licensed Product outside of the U.S. and Japan, or the Mundipharma Territory, at Mundipharma’s sole cost.
Licenses
. Pursuant to the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, the Company granted Mundipharma an exclusive, royalty‑bearing license to develop, register and commercialize the Mundipharma Licensed Product in the Mundipharma Territory, subject to the Company’s retained right in Japan before the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement was terminated.
The Company also granted Mundipharma an option to obtain exclusive licenses to develop, register and commercialize rezafungin in a formulation for subcutaneous administration, or Subcutaneous Product, and in formulations for other modes of administration, or Other Products, in the Mundipharma Territory, subject to similar retained rights of the Company to conduct mutually agreed global development activities for such products. In addition, the Company granted Mundipharma a co‑exclusive, worldwide license to manufacture the Mundipharma Licensed Product and rezafungin.
Until the seventh anniversary of the first commercial sale of the Mundipharma Licensed Product in the Mundipharma Territory, each party granted the other party an exclusive, time-limited right of first negotiation to obtain a license to any anti-fungal product (other than Mundipharma Licensed Product, Subcutaneous Product and Other Products) that such party proposes to out-license in the other party’s territory.
Financial Terms
. As of the execution of the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, the parties agreed to share equally (
50
/50) the costs of Global Development Plan activities, or Global Development Costs, subject to a cap on Mundipharma’s Global Development Cost share of $
31.2
 million. The total potential transaction value was $
568.4
 million, including an equity investment, an up-front payment, global development funding, and certain development, regulatory, and 
104
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
commercial milestones. The Company was also eligible to receive double-digit royalties in the teens on tiers of annual net sales.
Termination
. The Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement was terminated upon the effectiveness of the assignment to Napp on April 24, 2024.
Revenue Recognition
Prior to the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement termination on April 24, 2024, the Company determined the transaction price was equal to the up-front fee of $
30.0
 million, plus the R&D funding of $
31.2
 million, plus milestones achieved of $
27.9
 million. The common stock issued pursuant to the Mundipharma Stock Purchase Agreement was determined to be issued at fair market value after applying a lack of marketability discount as Mundipharma received restricted shares. Therefore, no additional premium or discount was allocated to the transaction price of the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement for the share issuance. The transaction price was allocated to the performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price estimated for each performance obligation. In estimating the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation, the Company utilized discounted cash flows and developed assumptions that required judgment and included forecasted revenues, expected development timelines, discount rates, probabilities of technical and regulatory success and costs for manufacturing clinical supplies. A description of the distinct performance obligations identified under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, as well as the amount of revenue allocated to each distinct performance obligation, was as follows:
Licenses of Intellectual Property.
 The license to the Company’s intellectual property, bundled with the associated know-how, represented a distinct performance obligation. The license and associated know-how was transferred to Mundipharma during September 2019, therefore the Company recognized the revenue related to this performance obligation in the amount of $
17.9
 million in September 2019 as collaboration revenue in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Research and Development Services.
 The Company and Mundipharma shared equally in the costs of ongoing rezafungin clinical development in the Mundipharma Territory up to the specified cap, which represented a distinct performance obligation. The Company recorded these cost-sharing payments due from Mundipharma as collaboration revenue. The Company concluded that progress towards completion of the performance obligation related to the R&D services was best measured in an amount proportional to the R&D expenses incurred and the total estimated R&D expenses.
Clinical Supply Services.
 The Company’s initial obligation to supply rezafungin for ongoing clinical development in the Mundipharma Territory represented a distinct performance obligation. The Company concluded that progress towards completion of the performance obligations related to the clinical supply services was best measured in an amount proportional to the clinical supply services expenses incurred and the total estimated clinical supply services.
Milestone Payments.
 In November 2020, the Company achieved a $
11.1
 million milestone under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, which was previously recorded as current contract liabilities as of December 31, 2024 because the rights to consideration were expected to be satisfied within one year. The Company received payment for this milestone in January 2021. Mundipharma was entitled to credit the full amount of this milestone payment toward future royalties payable to the Company, subject to a limit on the amount by which royalty payments to the Company may be reduced in any quarter. If Mundipharma had not fully credited the amount of such milestone payment toward royalties payable to the Company before the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024 and (ii) termination of the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement by Mundipharma, the Company would have been obligated to refund the uncredited portion of such milestone payment to Mundipharma on the earlier of such dates. The full amount was forgiven in July 2024 as part of the rezafungin asset sale and the Company included $
11.1
 million in the transaction price of the Napp Purchase Agreement. In December 2021, August 2022, December 2023, and January 2024, the Company achieved milestones of $
2.8
 million, $
11.1
 million, $
11.1
 million, and $
2.8
 million, respectively, under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement that the Company deemed to be tied to all the performance obligations identified in the original agreement. Revenue associated with these milestones has been allocated proportionately to the original transaction price which was allocated to the performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price estimated for each performance obligation. In conjunction with the performance obligations already delivered, revenue was recognized based on the progress of these performance obligations, the unrecognized portion was recorded as contract liabilities at the reporting period end and was recognized as revenue over the remaining progress of these performance obligations. The Company received payment for these milestones in January 2022, September 2022, February 2024, and April 2024, respectively.
Royalties.
 As the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which sales-based royalties related, the Company recognized royalty revenue when the related sales occurred. Royalty revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 was

Melinta License Agreement
On July 26, 2022, the Company entered into the Melinta License Agreement with Melinta under which the Company granted Melinta an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that contained or incorporated rezafungin, or the Melinta Licensed Product, in the U.S., or the Melinta Territory.
Licenses
. Pursuant to the Melinta License Agreement, the Company granted Melinta an exclusive, royalty‑bearing license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers), to develop, register and commercialize the Melinta Licensed Product for all uses in humans and non-human animals in the Melinta Territory, subject to the Company’s retained right, as described below.
Non-Compete Covenant
. Until the fifth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the first Melinta Licensed Product in the Melinta Territory, neither the Company nor Melinta, nor any of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries could, directly or indirectly, itself or in collaboration with any third party, developed, manufactured for development or commercialization, or commercialized any product in the echinocandin class of drugs in the Melinta Territory without the other party’s prior written consent, subject to certain provisions in connection with a change of control of a party.
Commercialization.
 Melinta was solely responsible for the commercialization of rezafungin in the Melinta Territory, at its sole expense.
Continued Development and Regulatory Activities.
 The Company was responsible, at its sole expense, for conducting an agreed upon development plan, or the Melinta Development Plan, that included, among other activities, (a) completion of the ReSPECT Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial for the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in adult allogeneic blood and marrow transplant recipients, or the Prophylaxis Indication, (b) preparation and submission to the FDA of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, for the Melinta Licensed Product in the Prophylaxis Indication, (c) site close-out activity worldwide (outside of China) for the ReSTORE Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, or the Treatment Indication, (d) certain nonclinical studies and other nonclinical activities, (e) certain CMC activities for the Melinta Licensed Product, and (f) all other development activities that were required by the FDA to obtain marketing approval of the Melinta Licensed Product in the Treatment Indication and the Prophylaxis Indication in the Melinta Territory.
The Company remained the holder of the rezafungin IND and new drug application, or NDA, before the Melinta License Agreement was assigned. Both regulatory applications were to transfer to Melinta on a transfer date determined based on the status of the ReSPECT trial and the associated sNDA for the Prophylaxis Indication, after which Melinta would have been responsible for performing all activities that may have been necessary to maintain NDA approvals for the Melinta Licensed Product in the Treatment Indication and the Prophylaxis Indication in the Melinta Territory, at Melinta’s sole expense, subject to Melinta’s right to deduct from royalties payable to the Company the internal expenses (not to exceed a specified dollar amount per calendar year) and certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Melinta.
Supply and Transfer of CMC activities.
 Until Melinta assumed responsibility for the manufacture and supply of the Melinta Licensed Product for development and commercialization in the Melinta Territory, which it may do by direct purchase from the Company’s contract manufacturing organizations for the Melinta Licensed Product or by having a manufacturing technology transfer to Melinta or its designee performed at Melinta’s sole expense, which, in either case, will be no later than December 31, 2026, the Company was responsible for the manufacture and supply of the Melinta Licensed Product for development and commercialization by Melinta in the Melinta Territory, and during such period, supplied Melinta Licensed Product to Melinta pursuant to the terms of a supply agreement negotiated by the parties.
Financial Terms.
 Upon execution of the Melinta License Agreement, the total potential transaction value was $
460.0
 million, including a $
30.0
 million upfront payment and up to $
430.0
 million in regulatory and commercial milestone payments. In addition, the Company was eligible to receive tiered royalties on U.S. sales in the low double digits to mid-teens.
Termination.
 The Melinta License Agreement was terminated upon the effectiveness of the assignment to Napp on April 24, 2024.
Revenue Recognition
Prior to the Melinta License Agreement termination on April 24, 2024, the Company determined the transaction price was equal to the up-front fee of $
30.0
 million, plus a milestone achieved of $
20.0
 million. The transaction price was allocated to the performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price estimated for each performance obligation. In estimating the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation, the Company utilized discounted cash flows and developed assumptions that required judgment and included forecasted revenues, expected development timelines, discount rates, probabilities of technical and regulatory success, costs to continue the R&D efforts and costs for manufacturing clinical supplies. A description of the distinct performance obligations identified under the Melinta License Agreement, as well as the amount of revenue allocated to each distinct performance obligation, was as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Continued
Licenses of Intellectual Property.
 The license to the Company’s intellectual property, bundled with the associated know-how, represented a distinct performance obligation. The license and associated know-how was transferred to Melinta in August 2022, therefore the Company recognized the revenue related to this performance obligation in the amount of $
25.9
 million in August 2022 as collaboration revenue in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Research and Development Services.
 The Company was required to provide R&D services, at its sole expense, as described under the Melinta Development Plan, which represented a distinct performance obligation. The Company concluded that progress towards completion of the performance obligation related to the R&D services was best measured in an amount proportional to the R&D expenses incurred and the total estimated R&D expenses.
Clinical Supply Services.
 The Company’s obligation to supply rezafungin for ongoing clinical development in the Melinta Territory represented a distinct performance obligation. The Company concluded that progress towards completion of the performance obligations related to the clinical supply services was best measured in an amount proportional to the clinical supply services expenses incurred and the total estimated clinical supply services. Revenue related to the clinical supply services performance obligation recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
immaterial
.
Milestone Payments.
 In March 2023, the Company achieved a $
20.0
 million milestone under the Melinta License Agreement that the Company deemed to be tied to all the performance obligations identified in the original agreement. Revenue associated with the milestone has been allocated proportionately to the original transaction price which was allocated to the performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price estimated for each performance obligation. In conjunction with the performance obligations already delivered, revenue was recognized based on the progress of these performance obligations, the unrecognized portion was recorded as contract liabilities at the reporting period end and was recognized as revenue over the remaining progress of these performance obligations. The Company received payment for this milestone in April 2023.
Royalties.
 As the license was deemed to be the predominant item to which sales-based royalties related, the Company recognized royalty revenue when the related sales occurred. The Company recognized $
0.1
 million and $
0.2
 million in royalty revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, following the commercial launch of REZZAYO by Melinta in the U.S. on July 31, 2023.
Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
The Company incurred costs to a third party to obtain the Melinta License Agreement and capitalized $
2.0
 million upon execution of the Melinta License Agreement, and capitalized an additional $
0.5
 million upon achievement of a milestone, in accordance with ASC 340, 
Other Assets and Deferred Costs
. The Company incurred these costs in connection with all the performance obligations identified in the Melinta License Agreement and allocated the capitalized contract costs to performance obligations on a relative basis (i.e., in proportion to the transaction price allocated to each performance obligation) to determine the period of amortization. The expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $
0.2
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively, and is included within the results of operations from discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2024, there was 
no
 balance remaining of the asset recognized from costs to obtain the Melinta License Agreement.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
As of December 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or COSO, of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to the Company’s status as a non-accelerated filer.
Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness
We previously reported that our control over the evaluation of applicable indirect taxes in local jurisdictions and assessment of indirect tax accrued liabilities was not appropriately designed. Specifically, we did not design a control to properly evaluate the indirect tax impact of our supply chain activities, and to review the completeness and accuracy of the underlying indirect tax obligation. As a result, a material misstatement in our previously issued audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was not detected and was restated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
During 2024, as part of the remediation process, we implemented various controls to address our exposure to indirect taxes, which included additional training to existing staff, enhanced use of indirect tax consultants and experts, review and analysis of our new contracts for possible indirect tax exposures, quarterly calculations of the legal liability for indirect taxes for all shipments during the preceding quarter, and quarterly reconciliation of our legal liability account including assessment of any additional interest due or possible reversals upon settlement of our accrued indirect tax liabilities. Based on these additional procedures and control, our management has concluded this material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2024.

CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our implementation of our remediating plans for the material weakness, described above, resulted in changes in our internal control over financial reporting.
