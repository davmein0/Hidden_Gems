SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. We may, in some cases, use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking statements. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to, statements about:

•
our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our product candidates and any related restrictions, limitations, and/or warnings in the label of an approved product candidate;
•
our ability to successfully commercialize, and our expectations regarding future therapeutic and commercial potential with respect to, our product candidates;
•
the size and growth potential of the markets for our product candidates, and our ability to serve those markets;

•
our ability to develop sales and marketing capabilities, whether alone or with collaborators;
•
regulatory developments in the United States, or U.S., and foreign countries;
•
the performance of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers;

These forward-looking statements reflect our management’s beliefs and views with respect to future events and are based on estimates and assumptions as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We discuss many of these risks in greater detail under “Risk Factors.” Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents that we reference and have filed as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K by these cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

RISK FACTOR SUMMARY
Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading “Risk Factors” and should be carefully considered.
•
Due to the delayed filing with the SEC of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale or resale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital.
•
We need substantial additional funding to advance CD388 beyond Phase 2b, and to advance CBO421 and our other Cloudbreak programs.
•
We depend heavily on the success of CD388, which has completed Phase 2a clinical development, and we are very early in our efforts to develop other product candidates from our Cloudbreak program, none of which may be successful.
•
If we experience delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.
•
If clinical trials for CD388 or any other product candidates are delayed, terminated or suspended, or fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities, we may incur additional costs, or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
•
If serious adverse reactions or unexpected characteristics of our product candidates are identified during development, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some or all of our product candidates.
•
Any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, formulary committees, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.
•
We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.
•
We may not be successful in our efforts to identify, discover, and develop potential product candidates through our Cloudbreak platform or otherwise.
•
We intend to continue to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and to conduct some aspects of our research and preclinical testing and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research or testing.
•
We have no experience manufacturing product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale and will be dependent on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates. If we experience problems with any of these third parties, they could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or our ability to sell any approved products.
•
If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize, or will be delayed in commercializing, our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be impaired.
•
Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products.
•
If we are unable to generate revenues from partnerships, government funding or other sources of funding, we may be unable to resume our preclinical Cloudbreak programs.
•
The price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
