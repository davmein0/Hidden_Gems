Item 1. Business – Suite of Services
).  We work with these university partners to develop educational models that allow them the ability to decrease tuition or increase scholarships to their students which will often lower the debt their students incur.  We work with our university partners and thousands of high schools across the country on dual credit, online prerequisite courses and other programs that shorten the time to completion thereby lowering cost and debt levels.  We focus with our university partners and their local communities to develop programs where there are skills shortages such as healthcare, teacher education, science, technology, engineering and math.  GCE provides expanded academic counseling services and support to the students of our university partners which has proven to increase retention and completion.  Our faculty services and curriculum development teams assist not only our university partners but other universities and K12 schools in improving their online education pedagogy.   And our business model has helped our university partners as changes in the educational landscape has put pressure on their financial condition.
GCE is committed to hiring policies and practices that identify the most qualified candidate for a given position.  We believe that we must have the best talent, including employees who possess a diverse range of experiences, backgrounds and skills, in order to anticipate and meet the needs of our business and those of our university partners.  We provide employees with training, development, and educational resources that promote learning and lead to real career advancement opportunities. We believe that our success in attracting, retaining, and developing human capital is directly correlated to our ability to provide employees both an interesting and engaging work experience as well as opportunities for meaningful involvement in the surrounding community.  Our employees take advantage of these opportunities and share our commitment to and enthusiasm for community service projects, as well as charitable organizations throughout the Phoenix area. Through these activities, our employees have the opportunity to volunteer and provide servant leadership that benefits the surrounding neighborhoods and West Phoenix community.
Employee Learning and Development (ELD) Services 
–

We provide learning and development support to our employees through numerous ELD initiatives.  Onboarding Programs provide new employees a foundation from which one can progress in his or her career at GCE. Leadership Development, Team Development, Advanced Skills, and Self-Development Programs help employees improve their skills, assist management in identifying potential talent for leadership roles, and support those employees already in leadership roles.  Finally, our Compliance Curriculum ensures that employee stays current with regulatory and other compliance requirements. These programs and curricula are offered virtually as both synchronous and self-paced. 
Employee Tuition Benefit 
– GCE promotes the concept of lifelong learning and supports this concept by offering its employees a generous Tuition Benefit program through its university partner, GCU.  After 3 months of continuous service, fulltime employees admitted to GCU receive a 100% tuition reduction on undergraduate and graduate programs Additionally, the tuition benefit is available for an eligible employee’s spouse or up to two children with no more than two participants receiving the benefits at any one time.  An eligible employee’s spouse or child

admitted to GCU receives a 100% tuition reduction on undergraduate programs and a 50% tuition reduction on graduate programs.
Monitoring employee engagement and satisfaction
 – GCE administers an annual survey of all of its employees to assess employee engagement and satisfaction.  GCE received responses from 1,330 employees on the 2024 survey.  The survey asked a number of questions regarding employee engagement and satisfaction including whether they are actively engaged with their work, whether they have a sense of pride in what they do and whether they enjoy the type of work assigned to them.  The responses to each question were overwhelmingly positive.  To the prompt, “I plan to continue my career at GCE for at least two more years”; “I would recommend employment at GCE to a friend”; “I am actively engaged with my work at GCE”; and “Overall I am satisfied with GCE as an employer,” less than 12% of the responders disagreed with any of these statements. This survey also inquired about the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance topics that employees felt are important to GCE’s business performance and financial success both internal and external impacts.  The top five selected in the survey by employees and the percentage of the responders that selected that topic were Employee Health and Wellbeing (59%), Professional Integrity (47%), Human Capital Management (41%), Community Engagement (36%) and Workforce Diversity and Engagement (20%).  92% of those that responded to the survey confirmed GCE enables a culture of diversity.
Whistleblower hotline
 – GCE has a whistleblower hotline available to both internal and external parties.  The whistleblower policy is disclosed on the GCE intranet for employees and disclosed on the GCE investor relations website for external parties.  Hotline activity is managed by a third party and all claims are reviewed and monitored by the Chief Risk Officer and General Counsel.  All claims are discussed at the quarterly Audit Committee meetings.
Community Involvement by GCE and its Employees.
  Examples of activities in which we and our employees participate include:
●
Improving Our Neighborhood and Increased Home Values -
 Together with Habitat for Humanity and in concert with our largest university partner, we are participating in the largest home renovation project in the country in the West Phoenix area surrounding GCU’s campus. As of December 31, 2024, 1,446 projects have been completed in which 37,757 hours have been logged by volunteers. These efforts, combined with GCE and GCU’s expanded presence in the community, have contributed to a significant increase in home values since 2011 in the 85017 zip code.
●
Furthering Job Creation -
 We, along with GCU have launched a number of new business enterprises that have reduced costs, provided management opportunities for recent graduates and employment opportunities for students and neighborhood residents, while spurring economic growth in the area.
●
Youth Opportunity Foundation - 
Our employees volunteer and donate time and funds to the Youth Opportunity Foundation which provides advocacy, clinical treatment, education and workforce development for at-risk young people in underprivileged areas.
GCE also invests in the following activities that benefit the community.
●
Funding of Student Tuition Organizations - 
GCE contributes to private school tuition organizations, which are entities that allocate financial contributions toward tuition assistance and scholarships for disadvantaged students to attend Arizona private schools.  In 2024 and 2023, we contributed $4.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, to these organizations. 
●
Encouraging Employee Giving - 
We participate in Donate to Elevate, a program that encourages employees to participate in the Arizona individual tax credit program, which allows individual taxpayers to contribute money in lieu of state income tax payments to benefit private schools and other non-profit entities in Arizona, as well as local public schools and public charter schools. Employees are encouraged to designate tax dollars to the school or program of their choice.
●
Students Inspiring Students -
 GCE continues to support GCU’s free tutoring/mentoring program that serves Phoenix-area K-12 schools. Students who seek academic assistance in the GCU Learning Lounge may become eligible to receive the Students Inspiring Students full-tuition scholarship. To serve our university partners and community, we seek donations to fund this neighborhood scholarship program.

●
Sponsoring K-12 Educational Development -
 GCE supports GCU’s K-12 Educational Development Department through sponsorship of GCU’s Canyon Professional Development and K-12 Targeted School Assistance programs. Canyon Professional Development offers professional development opportunities for educators and administrators, and their student/parent engagement programs aim to help students become college ready. K-12 Targeted School Assistance programs also offer tutoring and mentorship and more to community schools to improve learning environments and outcomes. Both initiatives elevate public, private, charter and home schools in the form of scholarships, program discounts, professional development, events, and more.
●
Continuing Community Involvement -
 GCE and our employees partner in countless other community events and projects throughout the year.  We offer our full-time employees a maximum of 16 hours of PTO annually for community service. This time is used to volunteer at an approved charitable organization. Over 40 organizations are approved for employee volunteerism, including Habitat for Humanity.
In addition, GCE has historically partnered in countless community events and projects throughout the year, helping organizations such as the Phoenix Rescue Mission, Feed My Starving Children, Arizona Foster Care, Boy/Girl Scouts, Goodwill Arizona, St. Vincent de Paul, Young Life, Elevate Phoenix, Back to School Clothing Drive and St. Mary’s Food Bank. Our employees also went out into our surrounding neighborhoods to participate in programs such as Serve the City, Canyon Kids, Salute Our Troops, Colter Commons senior home visits and the Run to Fight Children’s Cancer.
Our Commitment to Diversity.
 A growing body of evidence suggests that diverse teams improve financial outcomes and support innovation, resiliency, and productivity.  GCE’s commitment to fostering diversity in its community is evident in the following:
●
Our Diversity Statement -
 Grand Canyon Education is a faith-friendly shared services provider that embraces a worldview which outlines a responsibility to both charity and stewardship which simply stated is, ‘to love others as yourself’. We are a community of people who value the pursuit of truth and find great understanding in the convergence of differing viewpoints, backgrounds and ideas.  We welcome employees from all walks of life which has contributed to a growing diversity within our population.  Our diversity encompasses a multitude of dimensions, including age, disability, national origin, race, color, religion, gender, veteran status and more.  Our Christian perspective compels us to treat every individual equally with respect and compassion.  All community members deserve a comfortable space to express their feelings, so that every voice is heard. 
 All members of the Company will be welcomed, valued, and provided safety in this community.  Finally, diversity not only enriches the workplace and the educational endeavors of our partners it is critical to it.  Maintaining a diverse environment requires a measure of tolerance and understanding commensurate with the dignity and value of all human life.  In sum, GCE values diversity because it values every employee and university partners’ students entrusted to its care.
●
Our Diverse Leadership
 - Our ability to attract and retain diverse talent is reflected at both our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and management levels.  Three of our six directors are women and two directors identify with an underrepresented diverse ethnicity.  In addition, for all of our employees at the level of manager and above totaling 644 persons, 70.2% are held by women and other diverse persons.
●
Our Diverse Workforce 
- As of December 31, 2024, 80.3% of our 5,830 employees are women and other diverse persons.  As of December 31, 2024, GCE employed approximately 4,092 professional and administrative personnel, including technical and academic advisors, counseling advisors, marketing and communication professionals, and personnel that handle financial aid processing, information technology, human resources, corporate accounting, finance, and other administrative functions. In addition, as of December 
31, 2024, GCE employed approximately 1,738 part-time employees most of whom are student workers.  None of our employees are a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us. We consider our relations with our employees to be strong.
●
Our Hiring Practices and Policies 
- Our hiring policies and practices include an Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy and Complaint Procedure, and the Disability Accommodation Policy. We post all open positions to a variety of job boards to ensure we attract diverse candidates. 
 We also collect and analyze employee demographic data to identify current trends.  
11

●
Training 
- We provide employees and management with regular training.  New hires all complete anti-discrimination and harassment training within 3 months of starting at GCE.  Thereafter, all employees complete the training every other year, while management undertakes it annually.  We have also provided Implicit Bias Training to all employees.
Environmental Awareness
Online education is inherently more environmentally friendly than traditional campus education with a reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) production caused by traveling to and from a brick-and-mortar campus.  It also increases student capacity while eliminating the need for construction of a physical campus.  A majority of our university partners’ students are enrolled in hybrid or online educational models.  In addition, a significant number of our university partners’ students utilize an ebook format versus paper textbooks, which is more environmentally friendly in that it saves paper and other materials and there is no shipment required.
GCE owns a four-story 325,000 square foot administrative building, which includes office space for approximately 2,700 employees, and a parking garage at our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona.  We constructed these facilities in 2016 and, as with every one of our projects over the past 16 years, we designed them to maximize energy efficiency and minimize electricity usage and environmental impact, which ultimately lowers our operating costs.  Our headquarters building includes the following design features:
●
North/South Building Orientation -
 GCE’s office building is orientated with north/south exposure in order to minimize direct sun and thereby reduce power usage.  Exterior courtyards were arranged to ensure summer shade thus creating outdoor areas that can be used by our employees throughout the year.
●
Use of Window Glazing -
 Our building utilizes significant window glazing to allow for daylighting thus reducing the need for supplemental electrical lighting.  As a result, the building is designed to use just .41 watts per square foot of electrical energy for lighting, which is half of what a typical environmentally efficient building uses.
●
Reducing Water Consumption -
 Water usage is another environmental factor for office space that is magnified by the Arizona weather.  GCE’s office building utilizes numerous water conservation methods including push-tap faucets, waterless urinals, and a rooftop rainwater collection system for irrigating the landscaping below, which significantly reduces our water consumption.
●
Other Design Features -
 Additional environment-friendly design features include low VOC paints, use of recycled building materials, interior and exterior LED light bulbs, motion sensor lighting and implementation of an energy-efficient VRF mechanical system.
In addition to our efficient facilities, we have undertaken other measures to minimize our environmental impact, including, among others:
●
implementing a Trip Reduction Program, which provides incentives to employees who participate in carpooling or take public transportation to work;
●
providing a telecommute option for a significant number of positions; and 
●
participating in a recycling program aimed at minimizing the volume of waste products generated by GCE.
Due to our significant investment in infrastructure, since March 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a global pandemic, a significant portion of our diverse workforce is continuing to work remotely.  This has not only increased employee satisfaction but has also resulted in savings in the areas of waste, janitorial costs, and travel costs related to business travel and commuting.
Our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites are all designed with the same efficient footprint in the 45 sites opened as of December 31, 2024.
Climate Disclosures
We do not operate in a high-risk industry for climate risks.  We believe that we have low climate risk with respect to our physical environment (e.g., fires, drought, hailstorms, increasing weather pattern changes).  A significant 
12

Table of Contents
percentage of our workforce is continuing to work remotely.  We have insurance policies in place to cover any damage for our property, plant and equipment.  Our Audit Committee is tasked with oversight of climate-related risks for the Company.
We are evaluating emissions reduction requirements with key suppliers for costs such as information security systems, communication and marketing costs, travel costs, and continued expansion of our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites.  We currently do not have any regulatory emissions reporting obligations.
We do not have significant risk from a transition to a low-carbon economy, which could result in changing customer behavior.  Our customers are university partners located in the United States.
Corporate Governance
We believe that effective corporate governance is critical to our ability to create long term value for our stockholders.  The following highlights certain key aspects of our corporate governance framework:
●
We Have an Independent and Diverse Board -
 Five of our six directors are independent.  Three of our six directors are diverse persons, and two of our directors identify with an under-represented diverse ethnicity.
●
We Have Majority Voting for Directors -
 We have adopted majority voting for directors pursuant to which nominees who fail to achieve an affirmative majority of votes cast must submit their resignation.
●
We Hold Annual Elections for Directors -
 We do not have a staggered board.
●
We Assess Board Performance -
 We conduct regular evaluations of our Board of Directors and Committees.
●
Our Independent Directors Meet Without Management -
 Our independent directors meet regularly in executive sessions without management present.
●
We Have a Stock Ownership Policy -
 We require both our named executive officers and our directors to maintain a meaningful ownership stake at levels specified in our stock ownership policy.
●
Our Key Committees are Independent -
 We have fully independent Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees.
●
We Do Not Have a “Poison Pill”
 - We do not maintain a stockholder rights plan.
Seasonality
Our service revenue normally fluctuates due to changes in our university partners’ enrollment which tends to be higher in the Spring and Fall periods and lower in the Summer.  Our expenses do not normally fluctuate significantly during the year which results in fluctuations in operating income between quarters. See “Item 7, 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Seasonality
.” 
Competition
There are dozens of companies that seek to partner with non-profit schools and state universities to assist in the development and operation of their educational programs. These companies provide various services that traditional institutions historically have not had the experience or organizational capability to fully support. These services include marketing and recruitment, enrollment management, curriculum development, online course design, student retention support, technology infrastructure, and student and faculty call center support. The largest companies in this sector have historically been Pearson Online Learning Services, Academic Partnerships and 2U, Inc.
The education services market, particularly with regard to those companies that help traditional universities develop new degree programs often delivered online, has historically been characterized by a full-service, revenue-sharing model, based on the premise that most traditional institutions are not only operationally unprepared to offer these programs at scale but also are not equipped to make the significant upfront investments necessary to develop these programs organically. In recent years, an alternative unbundled fee-for-service model has emerged, in which the companies offer the same services, or some subset of services, for the market price of those services. Finally, other industry providers affiliate with university partners to offer massive open online courses, which are aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web at little or no cost to the student.
13

Table of Contents
The education services market is changing and expanding. It is highly fragmented and subject to evolving technology, shifting needs of students and educators and introductions of new delivery modalities. We believe that the competitive factors in the education services market include:
●
reputation and brand awareness;
●
quality of university partner base and performance track record;
●
the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts;
●
robustness and evolution of technology solutions;
●
breadth and depth of services offerings;
●
convenient, flexible and dependable access to programs and classes;
●
level of student support services;
●
quality of student and faculty experience;
●
cost of programs; and
●
the time necessary to earn a degree.
Proprietary Rights
We have developed and own, or are licensed to use, intellectual property that is or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret, or other protections. This intellectual property includes but is not limited to technology, courseware materials and business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of operating a post-secondary educational institution with a significant online campus and to comply with the rules and regulations of various education regulatory agencies. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names, and agreements to protect our intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us that assign any intellectual property rights to us. In addition, we seek to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. While our intellectual property rights are important to us, we do not believe that the loss of any individual property right or group of related rights would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.

REGULATION OF OUR EDUCATION SERVICES BUSINESS
Prior to July 1, 2018, GCE, owned and operated GCU.  On July 1, 2018, GCE sold GCU to an independent, Arizona non-profit corporation (the “Transaction”).  As a result of the Transaction, we no longer own and operate an institution of higher education, nor do we directly participate in Title IV programs

regulated and overseen by ED under the Higher Education Act (“HEA”).  Instead, we operate as an education service company to institutions of higher education that do participate in Title IV programs.  Nevertheless, we are required to comply with certain regulations promulgated by ED for the following reasons:
●
Our operations are subject to regulation by ED due to our university partners’ participation in the federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA. Those Title IV programs include educational loans with below-market interest rates that are issued by the federal government under the Federal Direct Loan program (the “FDL Program”), as well as grant programs for students with demonstrated financial need. To participate in the Title IV programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agency or agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED, and be certified as an eligible institution by ED.
●
As a third-party servicer under the HEA and the related regulations, we also have a direct relationship with ED. ED regulates our operations insofar as we are performing certain functions classified as third-party servicer functions under relevant regulations and sub-regulatory guidance. A “Third-party servicer” is any person or entity used by “any eligible institution of higher education to administer, through either manual or automated processing, any aspect of such institution’s student assistance programs.”  Third-party servicers must comply with a number of regulatory requirements.  For example, they must conduct and submit to ED compliance audits under 
34 C.F.R. § 668.23
.  In addition, they must comply with the requirements of 
34 C.F.R. § 668.25
, which among other things, requires third-party servicers, in their contracts with institutions, to be contractually obligated to, among other things:
o
Comply with all statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, including the requirement to use any funds that the servicer administers under any Title IV program and any interest or other earnings thereon solely for the purposes specified in and in accordance with that program;
o
Refer to the Office of Inspector General of ED for investigation any information indicating there is reasonable cause to believe that the institution might have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with the institution’s administration of any Title IV program or an applicant for Title IV program assistance might have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her application; and
o
Be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary for any violation by the servicer of any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, and any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA.
We are also subject to a number of data security and privacy regulations given our role as a third-party service provider, the compliance with which can materially impact our business model.  In addition, as more fully described below, we are subject to some of the regulations imposed on our university partners by virtue of the nature of the services we provide.
The HEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are frequently revised, repealed or expanded and the scope of services covered by regulations may evolve and change over time. Congress historically has reauthorized and amended the HEA in regular intervals, approximately every five to seven 
years. The re-authorization process is currently under way. The re-authorization of the HEA could alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university partners. In addition, ED is independently conducting an ongoing series of rulemakings intended to assure the integrity of the Title IV programs. ED also frequently issues formal and informal guidance instructing institutions of higher education and other covered entities how to comply with various federal laws and regulations. For example, in February 2023, ED released DCL 23-03, a guidance document expanding the definition of what activities are considered as third-party servicer activities.  
15

Table of Contents
After substantial community outreach to ED, and a number of notices that the guidance would be delayed, on November 14, 2024, the Department formally rescinded DCL 23-03.  Previously issued guidance on this topic (Dear Colleague Letters GEN 12-08, GEN 15-01, GEN 16-15 (as modified by the March 8, 2017 electronic announcement), and GEN-23-08) remains in effect.  Regarding data security matters, in Electronic Announcement GEN 23-09, ED stated that “[t]he Department will issue guidance on NIST 800-171 compliance in a future Electronic Announcement.”  While it does not appear ED has addressed this issue in 2024 through rulemaking or otherwise, we believe data security is an area of importance and, like all ED guidance, is subject to change and may impact our business model.
We are also regulated (depending upon the applicable activity being regulated) by other federal agencies or departments including the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).
REGULATION OF OUR UNIVERSITY PARTNERS
Institutions of higher education in America are subject to extensive regulation by state post-secondary, licensure and certification agencies, accrediting commissions, and the federal government through ED under the HEA, as well as (depending upon the applicable activity being regulated) other federal agencies and departments including the 
U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (“VA”), the FTC, the IRS, and for institutions who issue bonds, the SEC. The regulations, standards, and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of operations of colleges and universities, including educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financing and financial operations, athletics and financial condition.
Our current university partners and all likely future university partners are required to be authorized by appropriate state post-secondary, licensure, and certification authorities.  In addition, in order to participate in the federal student financial aid programs, our university partners will need to be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED.  Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability.  The HEA requires accrediting commissions recognized by ED to review and monitor many aspects of an institution’s operations and to take appropriate action if the institution fails to meet the accrediting commission’s standards.
Although we no longer own and operate an institution of higher education, nor do we directly participate in Title IV programs, regulatory matters that materially affect GCU and our other university partners will, necessarily, have a material impact on us.  The following section describes regulatory matters that affect our university partners and that may affect us as an education services provider to institutions of higher education generally.
State Post-Secondary Education Regulation
Our university partners are authorized to offer education by the relevant state authorizing agencies for the state in which such university partner is located. For example, GCU, our most significant university partner, is authorized to offer programs by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education, the regulatory agency governing private post-secondary educational institutions in the State of Arizona, where it is located. State authorization is very important to our university partners and, as a result, to our business. To maintain their state authorization, our university partners must continuously meet standards relating to, among other things, educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, marketing and recruitment, financial operations, addition of new locations and educational programs, and various operational and administrative procedures. Our university partners’ failure to comply with the requirements of a state regulatory agency could result in our university partners’ losing their ability to offer educational programs, which would cause our university partners to lose their eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs and could force them, and us, to cease operations. Alternatively, a state regulatory body could restrict our university partners’ ability to offer new or certain degree and non-degree programs, which may impair our ability to grow.
State regulatory requirements for online education have historically varied among the states.  To address this issue and to meet ED requirements many schools have applied and been approved to be institutional participants in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of post-secondary distance education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by post-secondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a national council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts. GCU, for example, is a member of SARA in Arizona (AZ-SARA), which is administered by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (referred to as W-SARA). There is a yearly renewal for 
16

Table of Contents
participating in NC-SARA and AZ-SARA and institutions must agree to meet certain requirements to participate. As of December 31, 2024, all states other than California are members of SARA.
Any state that does not participate in SARA may impose regulatory requirements on out-of-state post-secondary institutions operating within its boundaries, such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state. GCU, for example, enrolls students in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although it is currently licensed, authorized, in-process, or exempt in all non-SARA jurisdictions in which it operates, if GCU fails to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a non-SARA jurisdiction, or fails to obtain licenses or authorizations when required, it could lose its license or authorization by that jurisdiction or be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on its activities in, and fines and penalties imposed by, that jurisdiction, as well as fines, penalties, and sanctions imposed by ED. The loss of licensure or authorization in any non-SARA jurisdiction by a university partner institution could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that jurisdiction, which could significantly reduce such university partner’s enrollments.
Individual state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. To the extent required with respect to an educational service category covered by our contractual relationship, we expect to assist our university partners in meeting these requirements. Some states limit schools’ ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states. Some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of ED and may require the posting of surety bonds. While we are not directly subject to those laws, those laws may inhibit our university partners from expanding or operating in those states, limiting our ability to serve our university partners, which could significantly affect our business. In addition, state laws can indirectly regulate how we provide its services to its university partners.  For example, some states have considered new requirements that would dictate what information we must convey to students and prospective students and impose reporting requirements related to the nature of our services.  To the extent such requirements were ultimately enacted into law, they could significantly affect our business.
State Professional Licensure
Many states have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in specified fields, including fields such as healthcare, education, and counseling. These requirements vary by state and by field. A student’s success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors, including the background and qualifications of the individual graduate, as well as the following factors, among others:
●
whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association;
●
whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state;
●
whether the institution and the program are accredited and, if so, by what accrediting commissions; and
●
whether the institution’s degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work.
Many states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields, such as nursing and teaching. Many states will certify individuals if they have already been certified in another state.
Prior to opening a new off-campus classroom and laboratory site, university partners often require approval from the applicable state board to offer its programs at that location.  This can delay the site opening and timing can vary based on the state and the university partner.
Although not directly regulated by these entities, we must be mindful of the requirements placed by state professional licensure bodies on our university partner institutions to ensure those institutions maintain that licensure.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability. To be recognized by ED, accrediting commissions must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions, and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria. An accredited school is subject to 
17

Table of Contents
periodic review by its accrediting commissions to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation.
Our most significant university partner, GCU has been regionally accredited by the HLC and its predecessor since 1968, most recently obtaining reaccreditation in 2017 for the ten-year period through 2027. The HLC is an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education and accredits entire institutions of higher education. The HLC has historically been categorized as a regional accreditor.  Institutional accreditation by a recognized accreditation agency is one of the prerequisites for an institution of higher education to be eligible to disburse Title IV aid to students. In addition, GCU holds a number of programmatic accreditations related to the conduct of specific programs of the university. Other colleges and universities depend, in part, on an institution’s accreditation (institutional, and, in some cases, programmatic) in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates’ credentials, and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards.
University partners other than GCU may be accredited by different accrediting bodies that are likely to have standards that are different from those of the HLC. Moreover, our other university partners hold various programmatic accreditations that set additional requirements related to specific programs, including for their nursing programs. As we work with university partners in different regions we will need to work with those accrediting bodies and tailor our services to meet the requirements of those accreditors.
Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs
To be eligible to participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED. An institution must, among other things, be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state in which it is physically located and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by ED.
The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through the Title IV programs and the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs have caused Congress to require ED to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over educational institutions. As a result, our university partners are subject to extensive oversight and review. Because ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances to our university partners or to us directly.
Significant regulations and other factors relating to the Title IV programs that could adversely affect us include the following:
Congressional action
.
 Congress must reauthorize the HEA on a periodic basis, usually every five to six years, and the most recent reauthorization through September 30, 2013, occurred in August 2008. The reauthorized HEA reauthorized all of the Title IV programs in which institutions participate but made numerous revisions to the requirements governing the Title IV programs, including provisions relating to student loan default rates and the formula for determining the maximum amount of revenue that institutions are permitted to derive from the Title IV programs. In addition, members of Congress periodically introduce legislation that would impact Title IV programs and the higher education industry generally. Because a significant percentage of our revenue is indirectly derived from the Title IV programs, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of our university partners to participate in the Title IV programs could reduce the ability of some students to finance their education at our university partner institutions and materially decrease their student enrollment.
Eligibility and certification procedures
.
 Each institution must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in the Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. To the extent ED suspends, limits, modifies, conditions, or terminates any university partner institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV, including by disallowing the institution from adding new programs or terminating the institution from Title IV eligibility programs, that action is likely to have a negative impact on our business.
ED may also grant an institution the ability to participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis while it completes its review of the institution’s application.  For an institution that is certified on a provisional basis, ED may revoke the institution’s certification without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that 
18

Table of Contents
action. For an institution that is certified on a month-to-month basis, ED may allow the institution’s certification to expire at the end of any month without advance notice, and without any formal procedure for review of such action. To our knowledge, either such action is very rare and has only occurred upon a determination that an institution is in substantial violation of material Title IV requirements.  Our primary university partner, GCU, currently operates under a provisional program participation agreement that expires on June 30, 2026.
Administrative capability
. 
ED regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in the Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things:
●
comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements;
●
have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer the Title IV programs;
●
have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;
●
not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels;
●
have various procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV funds and for maintaining required records;
●
administer the Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls;
●
not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;
●
provide financial aid counseling to its students;
●
refer to ED’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving the Title IV programs;
●
submit all required reports and consolidated financial statements in a timely manner; and
●
not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.
As an education services company, we assist our university partners with some facets of these criteria. As such, we must be mindful of, and compliant with, the administrative capability requirements. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, ED may:
●
require the institution to repay Title IV funds its students previously received;
●
transfer the institution from the advance method of payment of Title IV funds to heightened cash monitoring status or the reimbursement system of payment;
●
place the institution on provisional certification status; or
●
commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution’s participation in the Title IV programs.
Imposition of these sanctions on any of our university partners could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.
Financial responsibility.
 The HEA and ED regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in the Title IV programs. ED evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution’s annual audited consolidated financial statements, as well as when the institution applies to ED to have its eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs recertified. The most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution’s composite score, which is derived from a formula established by ED based on three financial ratios:
●
equity ratio, which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability and ability to borrow;
●
primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and
●
net income ratio, which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit or within its means.
ED assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. ED then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score for an institution’s most recent fiscal year must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further ED oversight. In addition to having an 
19

Table of Contents
acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with Title IV program requirements, meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments, and not receive an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited consolidated financial statements.
As an education service company, we are not directly subject to this regulation. However, if ED were to determine that a university partner institution did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other financial responsibility factors, ED could impose a range of sanctions on the institution, such as requiring the institution to post a letter of credit, accept provisional certification (which would hamper the ability of the institution to add new programs), comply with additional ED monitoring requirements, agree to receive Title IV program funds under an arrangement other than ED’s standard advance funding arrangement, such as the reimbursement system of payment or heightened cash monitoring, and comply with or accept other limitations on the ability to increase the number of programs it offers or the number of students it enrolls, any of which sanctions on our university partners could also adversely affect our business. In addition, because other regulators may use the composite score for their purposes, a poor composite score could have additional effects.  For example, NC-SARA utilizes an institution’s composite score in determining whether such institution is eligible to participate in SARA.
Based on the data derived from the audited financial statements of GCU as of each of June 30, 2024 and 2023, GCU’s composite score was 1.9 and 1.8, respectively, using the proprietary school calculation methodology.  If GCU’s future composite scores do not exceed 1.5, ED could impose sanctions.  If any such sanctions were imposed, it could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.
Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw
. 
When a student who has received Title IV program funds withdraws from school, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has “earned” and then must return the unearned Title IV program funds (a “return to Title IV”) to the appropriate lender or ED in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to ED equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under ED regulations, the letter of credit requirement is triggered by late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of the withdrawn students (and involving more than two student refunds) in the audit sample in the institution’s annual Title IV compliance audit for either of the institution’s two most recent fiscal years or in a ED program review. Additionally, in
 January 2025, ED published new regulations, that become effective on July 1, 2026, related to a number of areas, including those concerning return to Title IV.  We are in the process of reviewing the regulations and have not formed a view as to the impact on our business.
The “90/10 Rule.”

A requirement of the HEA, commonly referred to as the “90/10 Rule,” that is applicable only to proprietary, post-secondary educational institutions, provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenue for each of two consecutive fiscal years from Title IV program funds. For purposes of the 90/10 Rule, revenue is calculated under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of an institution’s revenue under generally accepted accounting principles that appears in its consolidated financial statements. Under the 90/10 Rule, an institution becomes ineligible to participate in the Title IV programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which it exceeds the 90% threshold, and its period of ineligibility extends for at least two consecutive fiscal years. If an institution exceeds the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years and it and its students have received Title IV funds during the subsequent period of ineligibility, the institution will be required to return those Title IV funds to the applicable lender or ED. If an institution’s rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year, it will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years.
Based on new regulations that went into effect on January 1, 2023, the 90/10 Rule was modified to include tuition assistance programs offered by the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Veterans Administration as part of the 90% threshold, in addition to the Title IV programs already covered by the 90/10 Rule.  This means that institutions subject to the 90/10 Rule will be required to limit the combined amount of Title IV funds and applicable “Federal funds” revenue in a fiscal year to no more than 90% in a fiscal year as calculated under the rule, and the change to the 90/10 Rule is thus expected to increase the 90/10 Rule calculations for institutions subject to the rule.  Using ED’s cash-basis, regulatory formula under the 90/10 Rule as currently in effect, GCU derived approximately 67.2% and 65.5% of its 90/10 Rule revenue from Title IV program funds for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, per 
20

Table of Contents
GCU’s audited financial statements.  Accordingly, even if ED continues to treat GCU as a proprietary institution for Title IV purposes, we do not expect this rule to have any material impact on GCU.
Legislation has been introduced in both chambers of Congress that seeks to further modify the 90/10 Rule, including proposals to change the ratio requirement to 85/15 (federal to nonfederal revenue), or to eliminate the 90/10 Rule. We cannot predict whether or how legislative or regulatory changes will affect the 90/10 Rule.
Student loan defaults
. 
Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of their federal student loans exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, ED calculates a rate of student defaults for each institution (known as a “cohort default rate”). The rate is calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the second year following the first federal fiscal year (known as the “three-year method”).
ED applies legal thresholds to measure an institution’s compliance. If ED notifies an institution that its cohort default rates exceeded 30%, for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years, the institution’s participation in the FDL Program and the Pell grant program would end 30 days after that notification, unless the institution appeals that determination in a timely manner on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. In addition, an institution’s participation in the FDL Program would end 30 days after notification by ED that its most recent cohort default rate, is greater than 40%, unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. An institution whose participation ends under either of these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification or for the next two fiscal years. If an institution’s cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year equals or exceeds 30%, ED may place the institution on provisional certification status.
While we cannot directly influence a university partner’s cohort default rates, and do not provide default rate management services, in the course of performing services for a university partner we would work to assist such university partner in ensuring that its cohort default rates do not present a compliance risk under this regulation. Nonetheless, if a university partner institution exceeded the threshold under the three-year method, the sanction imposed could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.  While GCU’s cohort default rates have historically been significantly below these levels, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case.
Incentive compensation rule
.
 An institution that participates in the Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity. Since we are involved in recruiting and admission activities on behalf of our university partners, under current regulations, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, who are those employees involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution. We are also precluded from offering our covered employees who work on financial aid matters (if any), any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the award of financial aid to students enrolled in a postsecondary institution.
In addition, the incentive compensation rule raises the question as to whether companies like ours, as an entity, are prohibited from entering into tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with university partners. On March 17, 2011, ED issued official agency guidance, known as a “Dear Colleague Letter,” or a DCL, providing guidance on this point. The DCL states that “[t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided” and that “[t]his is true regardless of the manner in which the entity compensates its employees.” But the DCL also provides an important exception to the ban on tuition revenue-sharing arrangements between institutions and third parties. According to the DCL, ED does not consider payment based on the amount of tuition generated by an institution to violate the incentive compensation ban if the payment compensates an “unaffiliated third party” that provides a set of “bundled services” that includes recruitment services, such as those we provide. Example 2-B in the DCL is described as a “possible business model” developed “with the statutory mandate in mind.” Example 2-B describes the following as a possible business model:
“A third-party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, provides bundled services to the institution including marketing, enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online delivery of courses, the provision of 
21

Table of Contents
technology, placement services for internships, and student career counseling. The institution may pay the entity an amount based on tuition generated for the institution by the entity’s activities for all the bundled services that are offered and provided collectively, as long as the entity does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees, and the institution does not pay the entity separately for student recruitment services provided by the entity.”
The DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2-B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and ED’s regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with our university partners closely follow Example 2-B in the DCL. In addition, we assure that none of our “covered employees” is paid any bonus or other incentive compensation in violation of the rule.
Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by ED in the form of a DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, the rule could be altered or removed without prior notice, public comment period or other administrative procedural requirements that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Similarly, a court could invalidate the rule in an action involving our company or our university partners, or in action that does not involve us at all. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, ED or a court could require us to change our business model in ways that could be detrimental to our business.
Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations
.  Under the HEA and its implementing regulations, students may file a claim with ED to discharge their FDL Loans if, generally, they believe their institution misled them or engaged in other misconduct related to the making of their federal loans or the provision of their educational services.  This is referred to as a “borrower defense to repayment” or “BDR” claim.  The regulations governing the standards and processes pursuant to which BDR claims are adjudicated have been revised multiple times since their introduction in 1994, with the result that the current regulatory framework is extraordinarily complex.  It is generally the case that an individual BDR claim would be adjudicated by an ED staff member and any subsequent recoupment process against the applicable institution initiated by ED would be overseen by a hearing official.  But the specific standards and processes that apply vary depending on when the underlying loan was made, and certain versions of the law permit the formation of a group claims process by ED.
In November 2022, the Biden administration promulgated a revised version of the BDR rule, which took effect on July 1, 2023.  In August 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, enjoining the implementation of the borrower defense and closed school provisions of that rule.  While this case is decided, the previous versions of the borrower defense and closed school provisions are in effect.
Litigation related to the various iterations of the BDR regulations, and the enforcement of these regulations has made this area complicated for all parties to understand and assess.  Further, the lack of adjudications in this area has also made things less clear.  Nonetheless, if our university partners are determined to have violated this regulation there could be significant sanctions imposed, whether related to the recoupment of any loans extinguished by ED, the imposition of letters of credit, or other sanctions under the financial responsibility or administrative capability regulations (among others).  This could put a financial strain on our university partners and negatively affect our business.  Also, if we were determined to have been the cause of the meritorious BDTR claim, our partners may have claims against us.
Note, the borrower defense to repayment regulations discussed herein were and are extensive and this does not attempt to discuss all the facets of any of the versions of these regulations. We cannot determine what effect, if any, these regulations may have on out university partners or on us.
Compliance reviews. 
Our university partners institutions are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including ED, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, the applicable state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans, and accrediting commissions. As part of ED’s ongoing monitoring of institutions’ administration of the Title IV programs, the HEA also requires institutions to annually submit to ED a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and ED audit standards. In addition, to enable ED to make a determination of an institution’s financial responsibility, each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with ED regulations.
As a third-party servicer, not only are our university partners subject to reviews and audits that may require our involvement, but we are also subject to program reviews from ED and the Office of the Inspector General. Further, we 
22

Table of Contents
also have an obligation to annually submit to ED a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and ED audit standards.
Gainful employment rule
s.
 Under the HEA, proprietary schools are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to “gainful employment in a recognized occupation,” with the limited exception of qualified programs leading to a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts. ED attempted to define this in a series of regulations from 2010 to 2016.  On July 1, 2019, ED rescinded the previously enacted gainful employment regulations.  While this change was effective July 1, 2020, ED also permitted institutions to enact this change as early as July 1, 2019, so long as any such institution made manifest its intention to be subject to the rescinded regulations.  It is our understanding that GCU had made manifest that intention and, as of July 1, 2019, was no longer subject to the gainful employment rules.   Given that GCU is currently our only university partner that is considered a proprietary school by ED, the gainful employment rules apply to it but not to our other university partners.  While GCU largely complied with the previously published gainful employment rules, those rules did indicate that four current degree programs were in the “Zone” – that is, potentially faced sanctions in the future if GCU could not reform the programs to comply with the regulations – including three undergraduate education programs and the Masters in Theology.
ED published new gainful employment regulations in 2023, which became effective July 1, 2024.  These new regulations establish rules for annually evaluating GCU’s educational programs based on the calculation of debt-to-earnings rates (an annual debt-to-earnings rate and a discretionary debt-to-earnings rate) and a median earnings measure.  ED will calculate these rates and measures under complex regulatory formulas outlined in the regulations and using data such as student debt (including not only Title IV loans but also certain private loans and extensions of credit), student earnings data, and comparative median earnings data for young working adults with only a high school diploma or GED.  If GCU’s programs were to yield debt-to-earnings rates or a median earnings measure that do not comply with regulatory benchmarks for two of three consecutive years, they would lose Title IV eligibility for each of the impacted educational programs.  The regulations will also require institutions to provide warnings to current and prospective students for programs in danger of losing Title IV eligibility (which could deter prospective students from enrolling and current students from continuing their respective programs).  The regulations also include provisions for providing certifications and reporting data to ED and providing required student disclosures related to gainful employment.
The regulations include gainful employment rates and measures that will be based in part on data that is not readily accessible to us or GCU, which makes it difficult for us to predict with certainty how GCU’s educational programs will perform under the new gainful employment benchmarks and the extent to which certain programs could become ineligible for Title IV participation.  ED released performance data at the time it published the proposed regulations that calculates rates for each school’s programs while acknowledging that the methodology used to produce the calculations differs from the methodology in the proposed regulations due to limitations in data availability.  Because neither we nor GCU nor ED have access to all of the data that will ultimately be used to evaluate GCU’s programs, we cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, GCU’s programs could fail to comply with the new gainful employment benchmarks.  Moreover, we do not have control over some of the factors that could impact the rates and measures for GCU’s programs which will limit our ability to eliminate or mitigate the impact of the regulations on us and GCU’s educational programs.
Although we cannot predict how GCU’s programs will perform under the new gainful employment metrics, the performance data released suggests that in general the programs that were in the “Zone” under the previous gainful employment rules - certain undergraduate teacher education and theology programs as well as certain Master’s in Counseling programs - are in jeopardy of failing under the new rules.  Given that the primary issue for the undergraduate programs that are in jeopardy of failing the new rules is not high average debt levels but rather relatively low earnings rates for first year teachers, it will be difficult for GCU to make material changes to ensure these programs do not fail.  The Master’s of Counseling programs that are in jeopardy of failing are long duration programs as required by the programmatic accreditation standards and the Title IV regulations allow graduate students to borrow substantially more than is required to pay tuition.  Accordingly, the debt levels for these programs are higher than the university’s average.  Thus, the implementation of the new gainful employment regulations could require GCU to eliminate or modify these educational programs, could result in the loss of Title IV program funds for the affected programs, and could have a significant impact on the rate at which students enroll in these programs. In addition, given ED’s continued refusal to recognize GCU’s non-profit status, students in GCU programs that fail the new metrics may lose Title IV eligibility.
Substantial misrepresentation
. The HEA prohibits an institution that participates in Title IV programs from engaging in “substantial misrepresentation” of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the 
23

Table of Contents
employability of its graduates. ED has defined a misrepresentation as any statement made by the institution or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution that is false, erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive. A substantial misrepresentation is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment.
The regulation also covers statements made by any representative of an institution, including agents, employees and subcontractors, and statements made directly or indirectly to any third party, including state agencies, government officials or the public, and not just to students or prospective students.  Therefore, we are subject to this regulation.
Considering the breadth of the definition of “substantial misrepresentation,” it is possible that despite our efforts to prevent such misrepresentations, our employees or contractors may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations for which our university partners would be held responsible by ED. We and our employees and subcontractors, as agents of our university partners, must use a high degree of care to comply with such rules and are prohibited by contract from making any false, erroneous or misleading statements about our university partners. To avoid an issue under the misrepresentation rule 
and similar rules, we assure that all marketing materials are approved in advance by our university partners before they are used by our employees and subcontractors in their conversations with students and prospective students.  Additionally, matters regarding substantial misrepresentation, and defining what constitutes “aggressive recruiting,” are currently the subject of negotiated rulemaking.  
While we are watching this process closely, we cannot determine what the outcome will be or the effect of these regulations on our university partners or on GCE.
Despite our best efforts, we or our university partners may face complaints from our university partners’ students and prospective students over statements made by us and our agents throughout the conduct of our services that would expose our university partners, and derivatively us, to increased risk of enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties and increased risk of private qui tam actions under the Federal False Claims Act. Also, if ED determines that an institution (including its contractors) has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may revoke an institution’s program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution’s participation in Title IV programs, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. 
Similar rules 
apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards, and the  FTC  applies similar rules prohibiting any unfair or deceptive marketing practices to the education sector. In
 October 2021, the FTC announced that it was resurrecting its Penalty Offense Authority under Section 5(m) of the FTC Act. Under the FTC Act, the FTC may secure penalties against entities not a party to an original proceeding if the FTC can show that the entity had actual knowledge that the conduct in question was found to be unfair or deceptive. Entities that have actual knowledge of acts or practices the FTC has found to be unlawful and that subsequently engage in such unlawful acts or practices may be held liable for civil penalties up to $50,120 per violation.  Also in October 2021, in an effort to establish actual knowledge and create a pathway for penalties in the event of post-notice acts or practices, the FTC issued notice to the 70 largest for-profit schools based on enrollment and revenues. The notice included a list of acts and practices that the FTC has determined are unfair or deceptive, including but not limited to acts relating to misrepresentation of employment opportunities and other benefits, together with citation to various prior determinations from cases previously litigated by the FTC.  Because of ED’s decision to continue to treat GCU as a for-profit institution for Title IV purposes, GCU received this notice. The FTC made clear at that time that receipt of the notice itself did not reflect any assessment as to whether GCU has engaged in deceptive or unfair conduct.
If ED or another regulator determines that statements made by us or on our behalf are in violation of the regulations, we could be subject to sanctions and other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Coordinated actions by certain federal agencies
. The Transaction was approved by GCU’s board of trustees based on its conclusion that it would be in the best interest of GCU’s students, faculty and staff for GCU to operate under the non-profit status that it previously held prior to 2004. Prior to the closing of the Transaction, the IRS, HLC and the State of Arizona approved GCU’s non-profit designation.  However, in
 November 2019, in connection with its approval of the Transaction without conditions, ED informed GCU that GCU does not satisfy ED’s definition of a non-profit entity and, as a result, that ED will continue to treat GCU as a proprietary institution for purposes of its continued participation in Title IV programs. Upon receipt of this determination, GCU and GCE entered into ongoing discussions 
24

Table of Contents
and negotiations that were then provided by GCU to ED regarding proposed changes to the services agreement between GCU and GCE and providing ED, upon request, with an updated transfer pricing study demonstrating that the revenue sharing arrangement reflected in the services agreement reflected fair market value for the services we provide.  Despite the ongoing discussions and negotiations, ED again denied GCU’s non-profit status in January 2021.  Thereafter, in order to pursue all available avenues for recourse on this matter, GCU opted to file a lawsuit against the ED, alleging that its 2019 and 2021 decisions overstepped its authority. While ED’s decision to continue to treat GCU as a for-profit institution was upheld by the federal district court in Arizona, in November 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit unanimously held that ED had failed to apply the correct legal standards in reviewing GCU’s application and it reversed the district court’s decision and remanded with instructions to set aside ED’s decision and to remand to ED for further proceedings. 
In
 October 2021, at the same time that the FTC issued the notice to the 70 for-profit schools as mentioned above, the FTC issued a public statement indicating that it would coordinate efforts with ED and the VA to investigate for-profit universities in furtherance of the notice.  Since the FTC’s statement, ED, the VA and the FTC have initiated multiple actions against GCU, including audits, compliance reviews, civil investigative demands, fines and lawsuits, and the FTC has initiated civil investigative demands and a lawsuit against us, that allege, among other things, misrepresentations made in connection with marketing activities, including statements made related to GCU’s non-profit status.  
These actions appear to have been coordinated in the manner described in the 2021 FTC statement. These actions, or any future actions by ED, FTC or any other federal or state government agencies or accrediting bodies with oversight over us or GCU, if ultimately resolved adversely to us or GCU, could result in monetary penalties and liabilities, further impact GCU’s non-profit status, and/or cause reputational harm.
