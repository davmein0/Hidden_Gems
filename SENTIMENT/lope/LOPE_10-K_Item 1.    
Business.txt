Overview
Grand Canyon Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“GCE” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded education services company dedicated to serving colleges and universities.  GCE has developed significant technological solutions, infrastructure and operational processes to provide services to these institutions on a large scale.  GCE’s most significant university partner is Grand Canyon University (“GCU”), an Arizona non-profit corporation that operates a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers graduate and undergraduate degree programs, emphases and certificates across ten colleges both online and on ground at its campus in Phoenix, Arizona and at eight off-campus classroom and laboratory sites.  As of December 31, 2024, GCE provided education services and support to approximately 127,150 students with more than 123,100 students enrolled in GCU’s programs, emphases and certificates.
We also provide education services to numerous university partners across the United States.  
In the healthcare field, we wo
rk in partnership with universities and healthcare networks across the country, offering healthcare-related academic programs at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites located near healthcare providers and developing high-quality, career-ready graduates who enter the workforce ready to meet the demands of the healthcare industry. In addition, we have provided certain services to a university partner to assist them in expanding their online graduate programs.  As of December 31, 2024, GCE provides education services to 22 university partners across the United States
.
We seek to add additional university partners and to introduce additional programs with both our existing partners and with new partners.   We may engage with both new and existing university partners to offer healthcare programs, online only or hybrid programs, or, as is the case for our most significant partner, GCU, both healthcare and other programs. We do disclose significant information for GCU, such as enrollments, due to its size in comparison to our other university partners.
Our Business 
GCE is an education services company with 22 university partners as of December 31, 2024. We have invested more than $345 million in the last 16 
years in technology which includes the cost to develop systems that automate key processes and enable us to scale these processes to hundreds of thousands of students. GCE is capable of supporting not just core academic functions, technology and marketing but many additional key processes that surround those functions, such as faculty recruiting and training, admissions, financial aid, accounting, and technical support. We provide these services to our university partners pursuant to master services agreements that define the scope of our engagement, the types of services provided and other key terms of the engagement.  Our investments also include the cost to build our off-site classroom and laboratory sites (including the specialized equipment) that are used by our university partners to educate healthcare students.
Suite of Services
The following describes the various services that we are capable of providing to university partners.  Services actually provided to a given university partner depend upon the nature of programs supported by GCE, existing university infrastructure, and university partner preferences.

Technology Services may include the following:
●
Learning Management System (“LMS”) - GCE designed and offers to its university partners its own proprietary LMS, called Halo.  All of GCU’s students, online and ground use this LMS. The basic functionality includes an interactive course syllabus, discussion questions and forums, instruction interaction, class quizzes, group assignments, written assignment submission and rubrics, grading, participation, attendance and integration with our student information system. The functions in Halo have been reimagined to work more intuitively with new user interface design and more seamless ways of accomplishing the same tasks.  Halo was designed as a “cloud native” application taking advantage of all the performance and reliability features of the cloud. Halo supports small classes that are instructor led, highly interactive and collaborative. Rich content that originates from a myriad of sources, including direct advisement from industry, is coupled with a robust discussion environment. Students most often respond to the content and discussion through written work. The writing assignments are designed to promote critical thinking which is often connected to solving real world problems. This platform can easily and reliably scale as student populations increase. The platform provides in-depth analytics that allow us to closely monitor student success and the quality of instructional resources.  GCE also designed its previous learning management system, LoudCloud which GCU used prior to HALO.

Each student is assigned a counselor before or during their first course, and several prescribed appointments with their counselor are scheduled throughout the student’s program to ensure that all state-specific progression requirements are met well in advance of deadlines.  GCE assists in gathering all required documentation, verifying it as official, and storing it as part of the student’s record.

Social Responsibility and Human Capital Development
Social responsibility and human capital development are a significant focus of the Company.  Our efforts are led by our Chief Executive Officer and a portion of his compensation is tied to our success in these areas.  To this end, our business was created and continues to evolve to meet the needs of the local community in which we operate as well as those outside our community.   We started by identifying what we believe to be the educational challenges that our country is facing and then worked to find solutions to these challenges.  We believe these challenges include: 
●
University education is too expensive;
●
Students are taking on too much debt;
●
Bachelor’s degrees are taking too long to complete;
●
Programs are not targeted enough toward careers.  Recent surveys show that a large percentage of college students would change majors if starting over, and a significant number of recent graduates are under employed or are in jobs that don’t required degrees;
●
As tuition increases, diversity decreases;
●
Universities have inadequate counseling and support services, especially for distance learners;
●
Most university professors have no formal training in teaching, learning or course design;
●
Universities are under significant financial pressure, which has only been enhanced due to the pandemic and a declining number of high school graduates attending college.
We provide the capital, technology and expertise to our university partners to lessen the challenges in each of the areas listed above (see
