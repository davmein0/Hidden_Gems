Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers
On January 29, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a $200.0 million increase under the Company’s existing stock repurchase program, reflecting an aggregate authorization for share repurchases since the initiation of the program of $2,245.0 million.  The current expiration date on the repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors is March 1, 2026. Repurchases occur at the Company’s discretion and the Company may modify, suspend or discontinue the repurchase authorization at any time. Repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to the applicable SEC rules. The amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will be made as market and business conditions warrant.
Since the initial approval of our share repurchase plan, we have repurchased 23,883,357 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,945.4 billion, which purchases are recorded at cost in the accompanying December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet and statement of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2024, there remained $99.6 million available under our current share repurchase authorization (which authorization was increased to $299.6 million in January 2025).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in Item 8, 
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in 
Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 and in Item 1A, 
Risk Factors
.
Executive Overview
GCE is a publicly traded education services company dedicated to serving colleges and universities.  GCE has developed significant technological solutions, infrastructure and operational processes to provide services to these institutions on a large scale.  GCE’s most significant university partner is GCU, a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers graduate and undergraduate degree programs, emphases and certificates across ten colleges both online, on ground at its campus in Phoenix, Arizona and at eight off-campus classroom and laboratory sites.
We also provide education services to numerous university partners across the United States. In the healthcare field, we 
work in partnership with universities and healthcare networks across the country, offering healthcare-related academic programs at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites located near healthcare providers and developing high-quality, career-ready graduates, who enter the workforce ready to meet the demands of the healthcare industry. In addition, we have provided certain services to a university partner to assist them in expanding their online graduate programs.  As of December 31, 2024, GCE provides education services to 22 university partners across the United States.
We seek to add additional university partners and to introduce additional programs with both our existing partners and with new partners.   We may engage with both new and existing university partners to offer healthcare programs, online only or hybrid programs, or, as is the case for our most significant partner, GCU, both healthcare and other programs.  In addition, we have centralized a number of services that historically were provided separately to university partners of Orbis Education; therefore, we refer to all university partners as “GCE partners” or “our partners”. We do disclose significant information for GCU, such as enrollments, due to its size in comparison to our other university partners.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. During the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those discussed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue recognition
. GCE generates all of its revenue through services agreements with its university partners (“Services Agreements”), pursuant to which GCE provides integrated technology and academic services, marketing and communication services, and as applicable, certain back office services to its university partners in return for a percentage of tuition and fee revenue.
GCE’s Services Agreements have a single performance obligation, as the promises to provide the identified services are not distinct within the context of these agreements. The single performance obligation is delivered as our partners receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over a series of distinct service periods (daily or semester). Service revenue is recognized over time using the output method of measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of the single performance obligation. The output method provides a faithful depiction of the performance toward complete 
49

Table of Contents
satisfaction of the performance obligation and can be tied to the time elapsed which is consumed evenly over the service period and is a direct measurement of the value provided to our partners. The service fees received from our partners over the term of the agreement are variable in nature in that they are dependent upon the number of students attending the university partner’s program and revenues generated from those students during the service period. Due to the variable nature of the consideration over the life of the service arrangement, GCE considered forming an expectation of the variable consideration to be received over the service life of this one performance obligation. However, since the performance obligation represents a series of distinct services, GCE recognizes the variable consideration that becomes known and billable because these fees relate to the distinct service period in which the fees are earned. GCE meets the criteria in ASC 606 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 and exercises the practical expedient to not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the single performance obligation that is unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. GCE does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations because the directly allocable variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The service fees are calculated and settled per the terms of the Services Agreements and result in a settlement duration of less than one year for all partners. There are no refunds or return rights under the Services Agreements.
Income taxes
. We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be realized. Our deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred tax liabilities. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets annually. Since becoming a taxable corporation in August 2005, we have not recorded any valuation allowances to date on our deferred income tax assets. We evaluate and account for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition occurs when we conclude that a tax position based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of the facts. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when we determine that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained upon examination. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, GCE has reserved approximately $14,626 and $13,631, respectively, for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties.

Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023
Service revenue
. Our service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,033.0 billion, an increase of $72.1 million, or 7.5%, as compared to service revenue of $960.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase year over year in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in GCU enrollments to 123,149 at December 31, 2024, an increase of 5.0% over enrollments at December 31, 2023. 
Partner enrollments totaled 127,155 at December 31, 2024 as compared to 121,250 at December 31, 2023.  University partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom 
50

Table of Contents
and laboratory sites were 4,919, an increase of 9.8% over enrollments at December 31, 2023, which includes 913 and 510 GCU students at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an increase in revenue per student year over year.  Excluding sites closing in 2024 to new enrollments, total enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites increased 14.9% between years.  The increase in revenue per student between years is primarily due to the 
s
ervice revenue per student for ABSN students at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites generating a significantly higher revenue per student than we earn under our agreement with GCU, as these agreements generally provide us with a higher revenue share percentage, the partners have higher tuition rates than GCU and the majority of our partners’ students take more credits on average per semester.  The increase in revenue per student in the year ended December 31, 2024 was also due to the additional day for leap year in 2024 which added additional service revenue of $1.5 million as compared to the prior year and we earned revenue in 2024 with a university partner in which we helped the partner develop an ABSN program under a cost plus arrangement.  We will earn limited revenue with this partner going forward.  Contract modifications for some of our university partners in which the revenue share percentage was reduced in exchange for us no longer reimbursing the partner for certain faculty costs and the termination of one university partner contract at the end of the Spring 2024 semester had the effect of reducing revenue per student.  
Partner enrollments totaled 127,155 at December 31, 2024 as compared to 121,250 at December 31, 2023.  Although partner enrollments at our off-campus classroom and laboratory sites returned to year over year growth in 2024, some existing partners continue to experience reduced incoming cohort sizes which has slowed the growth. We believe the growth in the number of ABSN students continues to be negatively impacted by the strong job market as these students have historically been individuals with already completed bachelor’s degrees choosing to re-career into one of these health professions.  To address this challenge, we have been working with our university partners to adjust their programs to allow students with the required education experience but without a completed bachelor’s degree to enter their programs.  The majority of those partners that have made the adjustment to admit students without a completed bachelor’s degree had new enrollment growth on a year over year basis in the Summer and Fall 2024 semesters.  
We opened five sites in the year ended December 31, 2023, six sites in the year ended December 31, 2024 and closed one site increasing the total number of these sites to 45 at December 31, 2024, which has also positively impacted the enrollment growth.  Enrollments for GCU ground students were 24,552 at December 31, 2024 down from 25,209 at December 31, 2023 due to a small decline in traditional ground students year over year and the continued decline in professional studies students (working adults attending the university’s traditional campus at night), partially offset by an increase in ABSN students between years.  GCU online enrollments were 98,597 at December 31, 2024, up from 92,070 at December 31, 2023, an increase of 7.1% between years.
Technology and academic services
. Our technology and academic services expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $165.1 million, an increase of $10.2 million, or 6.6%, as compared to technology and academic services expenses of $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in other technology and academic costs and in occupancy and depreciation of $8.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in employee compensation and related expenses, including share-based compensation of $3.0 million. The increases in other technology and academic costs and occupancy and depreciation were primarily due to the costs associated with the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites to support our 22 university partners and their increased enrollment growth as well as an increase in curriculum cost reimbursement to our university partners.  The decrease in employee compensation and related expenses is primarily due to decreased faculty reimbursements due to changes in our agreements with certain university partners whereby we no longer reimburse these partners for their faculty costs, partially offset by increased headcount to support our 22 university partners and their increased enrollment growth, tenure-based salary adjustments, benefit costs and the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites year over year. Our technology and academic services expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.1% to 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 16.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the decreased faculty reimbursements between years partially offset by the growing curriculum cost reimbursement.
 We anticipate that technology and academic services expenses as a percentage of revenue will increase in the future as we open more off-site classroom and laboratory sites and the growing curriculum cost reimbursements although these increases might be offset by lower faculty reimbursements if more partners choose to adjust their contracts.
Counseling services and support
. Our counseling services and support expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $323.5 million, an increase of $21.2 million, or 7.0%, as compared to counseling services and support 
51

Table of Contents
expenses of $302.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and related expenses including share-based compensation and benefits, in occupancy and depreciation costs and in other counseling services and support expenses of $18.0 million, $2.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The increases in employee compensation including share-based compensation and benefits were primarily due to increased headcount to support our university partners, and their planned increases in enrollment, tenure-based salary adjustments, benefit costs and the increased number of off-campus classroom and laboratory sites open year over year. The increase in occupancy and depreciation is primarily related to higher depreciation expense associated with our continued enhancements to technology infrastructure and internal-use software development.  The increase in other counseling services and support expenses is primarily the result of increased travel costs for our 22 university partners.  Our counseling services and support expenses as a 
percentage of revenue decreased 0.2% to 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to our ability to leverage our counseling services and support expenses across an increasing revenue base.  We anticipate that counseling services and support expense will increase in the future as we continue to invest to meet our partners’ needs although we might continue to have a decline in these costs as a percentage of revenue.
Marketing and communication
. Our marketing and communication expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $212.4 million, an increase of $9.6 million, or 4.7%, as compared to marketing and communication expenses of $202.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the increased cost to market our university partners’ programs and to the marketing of new university partners and new locations which resulted in increased advertising of $7.7 million, increased employee compensation, including share-based compensation and benefits of $1.1 million, an increase in other marketing and communication expenses of $0.5 million and an increase in occupancy and depreciation costs of $0.3 million.  Our marketing and communication expenses as a 
percentage of revenue decreased by 0.5% to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 21.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to our ability to leverage our marketing and communication expenses across an increasing revenue base.  We anticipate that marketing and communication expenses will increase in the future as we continue to invest to meet our partners’ needs although we might continue to have a decline in these costs as a percentage of revenue.
General and administrative
. Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $46.3 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 7.1%, as compared to general and administrative expenses of $43.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees including legal costs of $2.2 million, employee compensation, including share-based compensation and benefits of $1.4 million, which includes $1.1 million in severance costs recorded for an executive that resigned June 30, 2024, an increase in contributions in lieu of state income taxes of $1.0 million and increases in occupancy and depreciation costs of $0.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other administrative expenses of $1.7 million primarily due to lower travel costs.  Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue stayed flat at 4.5% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 due to our ability to leverage our general and administrative expenses across an increasing revenue base partially offset by the severance costs and the increase in professional fees including legal costs. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future and these costs as a percentage of revenue might increase if legal costs continue to rise faster than our revenue growth rate.
Impairment and other.

Impairment and other expenses of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily includes the write-off of an internal use software project that the Company had been attempting to develop for its other university partners that has been terminated and costs relating to exiting certain off-campus classroom and laboratory sites.
Amortization of intangible assets
. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $8.4 million for both periods.  As a result of the Acquisition, certain identifiable intangible assets were created (primarily customer relationships) that will be amortized over their expected lives.
Investment interest and other
. Investment interest and other for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $15.9 million, an increase of $5.4 million, as compared to $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to higher investment balances and higher returns on those balances.
Income tax expense
. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $65.1 million, an increase of $10.4 million, or 19.0%, as compared to income tax expense of $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our effective tax rate was 22.3% during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 21.1% during the year ended 
52

Table of Contents
December 31, 2023.  The effective tax rate increased year over year due to higher state income taxes.  This was partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits of $1.5 million as compared to $0.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a higher contribution in lieu of state income taxes of $4.5 million in 2024 compared to $3.5 million in 2023.  
The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense increases the volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the restricted awards vest.  Our restricted stock vests in March each year so any benefit or expense will primarily impact the first quarter each year.  
Net income
. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $226.2 million, an increase of $21.2 million, or 10.4% as compared to $205.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the factors discussed above.
Seasonality
Our service revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in our university partners’ enrollment. Our partners’ enrollment varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, and student attrition. Service revenues in the summer months (May through August) are lower primarily due to the majority of GCU’s traditional ground students not attending courses during the summer months, which affects our results for our second and third fiscal quarters. Since a significant amount of our costs are fixed, the lower revenue resulting from the decreased summer enrollment has historically contributed to lower operating margins during those periods. Partially offsetting this summer effect has been the sequential quarterly increase in enrollments that has occurred as a result of the traditional fall school start. This increase in enrollments also has occurred in the first quarter, corresponding to calendar year matriculation. Thus, we experience higher net revenue in the fourth quarter due to its overlap with the semester encompassing the traditional fall school start and in the first quarter due to its overlap with the first semester of the calendar year. A portion of our expenses do not vary proportionately with these fluctuations in net revenue, resulting in higher operating income in the first and fourth quarters relative to other quarters. We expect quarterly fluctuation in operating results to continue as a result of these seasonal patterns.

Overview

Our liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents and investments increased by $80.1 million between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, which was largely attributable to cash flows from operations exceeding share repurchases, investment purchases, net of proceeds and capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2024
.  Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $324.6 million and $244.5 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that our cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents and investments, will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures, and working capital requirements for at least the next 24 months.

The increase in cash generated from operating activities between the year ended December 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to increased income and changes in working capital balances, primarily accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Accounts payable increased between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 by $9.7 million compared to the decrease between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 of $3.1 million due to the timing of vendor payments.  Accrued liabilities increased by $4.3 million between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 whereas it decreased by $2.0 million between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 due to timing differences between the last pay period at the end of each fiscal year.

Investing activities provided $61.4 million of cash in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to consuming $80.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2023.
Cash provided by or used in investing activities includes net investment activity. In the year ended December 31, 2024, proceeds from the sale of investments, net of purchases of available-for-sale securities were $99.0 million as the Company sold all its investments in the third quarter of 2024 and the proceeds were invested in cash and cash equivalents.  In the year ended December 31, 2023, the purchase of available-for-sale securities, net of proceeds from the sale of investments were $35.0 million. 
In the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 cash used in investing activities also included capital expenditures totaling $37.2 million and $44.5 million, respectively.  Capital expenditures for both periods primarily consisted of leasehold improvements and equipment for new off-campus classroom and laboratory sites, as well as purchases of computer equipment, internal use software projects and furniture and equipment to support our increasing employee headcount. The Company incurs upfront expenses and capital expenditures prior to an off-campus classroom and laboratory site being opened. The Company intends to continue to spend approximately $30.0 million to $40.0 million per year for capital expenditures.

 (137,124)
Financing activities consumed $173.2 million of cash in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $137.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023.  
During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $165.4 million and $130.8 million, respectively was used to purchase treasury stock in accordance with GCE’s share repurchase program.  In 2024 and 2023, $7.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively, of cash was utilized to purchase common shares withheld in lieu of income taxes resulting from the vesting of restricted share awards. The Company intends to continue using a significant portion of its cash flows from operations to repurchase its shares.
Share Repurchase Program
On January 29, 2025, our Board of Directors increased the authorization under its existing stock repurchase program by $200.0 million, reflecting an aggregate authorization for share repurchases since the initiation of the program of $2,245.0 million.  
The current expiration date on the repurchase authorization by our Board of Directors is March 1, 2026. Repurchases occur at the Company’s discretion and the Company may modify, suspend or discontinue the repurchase authorization at any time.
Under our share repurchase authorization, we may purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to the applicable SEC rules. The amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will be made as market and business conditions warrant.
Since 2011, we have repurchased 23.9 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1,945.4 million, which includes 1,141,678 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $165.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations primarily consist of capital expenditures primarily for new off-campus classroom and laboratory sites opening and continued spend on computer equipment, software licenses, internal software development and furniture and equipment to support our increasing employee headcount. See 
Note 6 - Leases
, in Item 8,

Table of Contents
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 There are no other material contractual obligations or commitments for the Company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources as of December 31, 2024.
Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)
In addition to our GAAP results, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance and as part of our compensation determinations. Adjusted EBITDA is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, less interest income and other gain (loss) recognized on investments, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as adjusted for (i) contributions to private Arizona school tuition organizations in lieu of the payment of state income taxes; (ii) share-based compensation, and (iii) unusual charges or gains, such as litigation and regulatory reserves, impairment charges and asset write-offs, and exit or lease termination costs. We present Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. We also make certain compensation decisions based, in part, on our operating performance, as measured by Adjusted EBITDA. All of the adjustments made in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA are adjustments to items that management does not consider to be reflective of our core operating performance. Management considers our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period and does not consider the items for which we make adjustments (as listed above) to be reflective of our core performance.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA allows us to compare our current operating results with corresponding historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting relative interest expense, including the impact of write-offs of deferred financing costs when companies refinance their indebtedness), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), the book amortization of intangibles (affecting relative amortization expense), and other items that we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties as a measure of performance.
In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments described above. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine, or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool in that, among other things, it does not reflect:
●
cash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
●
changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements;
●
interest expense, or the cash required to replace assets that are being depreciated or amortized; and
●
the impact on our reported results of earnings or charges resulting from the items for which we make adjustments to our EBITDA, as described above and set forth in the table below.
In addition, other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental performance measure. For more information, see our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Represents contributions to various private Arizona school tuition organizations to assist with funding for education. In connection with such contributions made, we received a dollar-for-dollar state income tax credit, which resulted in a reduction in our effective income tax rate to 22.3% and 21.1% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Had these contributions not been made, our effective tax rate would have been 23.5% and 22.1% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such contributions are viewed by our management to be made in lieu of payments of state income taxes and are therefore excluded from evaluation of our core operating performance.

Item 7A.         
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market risk
. 
As of December 31, 2024, we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments. Although we do not currently have any investments, we have historically, and may in the future invest cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term certificates of deposit and money market instruments, municipal bond portfolios, or municipal mutual funds at multiple financial institutions.
Interest rate risk
. 
We manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents, BBB or higher rated corporate bonds, commercial paper, agency bonds, municipal securities, asset backed securities, municipal bonds, and collateralized mortgage obligations bearing variable interest rates, which are tied to various market indices or individual bond coupon rates. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities before their maturity date that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2024, we do not currently have any investments, and therefore a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings, fair values, or cash flows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Grand Canyon Education, Inc.:
Opinion on the

Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Grand Canyon Education, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over service revenue
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, service revenue is recognized from the delivery of support services to institutions in the post-secondary education sector of the United States (University Partners). The transaction price for support services is based on the Company receiving a contracted percentage of the University Partner’s tuition and fee revenue. The tuition and fee information received varies depending 
58

Table of Contents
on the respective University Partner’s reporting processes and the services provided. The Company recorded $1,033 million of service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.
We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over service revenue as a critical audit matter. This required especially subjective auditor judgment because service revenue recorded by the Company is dependent on the tuition and fee information of the University Partners. This included determining the nature and extent of procedures to be performed and evaluating the evidence obtained over the tuition and fee information.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over tuition and fee information of the University Partners. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to service revenue.  This included controls related to the accurate recording of amounts dependent on University Partners’ tuition and fee revenue information. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized as service revenue for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with University Partners and student enrollment documentation.
We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the nature of such evidence.

1. Nature of Business
Grand Canyon Education, 
Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “GCE”) is a publicly traded education services company dedicated to serving colleges and universities.  GCE has developed significant technological solutions, infrastructure and operational processes to provide services to these institutions on a large scale.  GCE’s most significant university partner is Grand Canyon University (“GCU”), an Arizona non-profit corporation that operates a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers graduate and undergraduate degree programs, emphases and certificates across 
ten
 colleges both online, on ground at its campus in Phoenix, Arizona and at 
eight
 off-site classroom and laboratory sites.
We also provide education services to numerous university partners across the United States. In the healthcare field, we work in partnership with a growing number of top universities and healthcare networks across the country, offering healthcare-related academic programs at off-campus classroom and laboratory sites located near healthcare providers and developing high-quality, career-ready graduates who enter the workforce ready to meet the demands of the healthcare industry.  In addition, we have provided certain services to a university partner to assist them in expanding their online graduate programs.  
As of December 31, 2024, GCE provides education services to 
22
 university partners across the Unites States.
GCE was formed in Delaware in November 2003 as a limited liability company, under the name Significant Education, LLC, for the purchase of acquiring the assets of the University from a non-profit foundation on February 2, 2004. On August 24, 2005, the Company converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and changed its name to Significant Education, Inc. On May 9, 2008, the Company changed its name to Grand Canyon Education, 
Inc. On July 1, 2018, the Company sold the university to GCU (the “Transaction”).  The Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries were historically used to facilitate expansion of the university campus prior to the Transaction.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, including the collection of accounts receivables and reserves associated with uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company invests a portion of its cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term certificates of deposit and money market instruments. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Investments
As of December 31, 2024 the Company had 
no
 investments.  As of December 31, 2023 the Company considered investments in 
corporate bonds, agency bonds, treasury bills and commercial paper as available-for-sale securities based on the Company’s intent for the respective securities
.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, determined using Level 1 and Level 2 of the hierarchy of valuation inputs, with the use of quoted market prices and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets. Unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income.  Unrealized losses considered to be other-than temporary are recognized currently in earnings.  Amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts, interest and dividend income and realized gains and losses are included in interest and other income.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Construction in progress represents items not yet placed in service and are not 
65

Table of Contents
depreciated. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Furniture and fixtures, computer equipment, and vehicles generally have estimated useful lives of 
ten
, 
four
, and 
five years
, respectively. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their lease term or their useful life. Land improvements and buildings are depreciated over lives ranging from 
10
 to 
40 years
.
Arrangements with GCU
On July 
1, 2018, the Company consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with GCU.  In conjunction with the Asset Purchase Agreement, 
the Company and GCU entered into a long-term master services agreement pursuant to which the Company provides identified technology and academic services, counseling services and support, marketing and communication services, and several back-office services to GCU in return for 
60
% of GCU’s tuition and fee revenue.
  Except for identified liabilities assumed by GCU, GCE retained responsibility for all liabilities of the business arising from pre-closing operations.
Internally Developed Technology
The Company capitalizes certain costs related to internal-use software, primarily consisting of direct labor associated with creating the software. Software development projects generally include 
three
 stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred), the application development stage (certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation or operation stage (all costs are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in the application development stage include costs of design, coding, integration, and testing of the software developed. Capitalization of costs requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service, these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally 
three years
. These assets are a component of our property and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets.
Capitalized Content Development
The Company capitalizes certain costs to fulfill a contract related to the development and digital creation of content on a course-by-course basis for each university partner, many times in conjunction with faculty and subject matter experts. The Company is responsible for the conversion of instructional materials to an on-line format, including outlines, quizzes, lectures, and articles in accordance with the educational guidelines provided to us by our university partners, prior to the respective course commencing. We also capitalize the creation of learning objects which are digital assets such as online demonstrations, simulations, and case studies used to obtain learning objectives.
Costs that are capitalized include payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated and spend time producing content and payments to faculty and subject matter experts involved in the process.  
The Company starts capitalizing content costs when it begins to develop or to convert a particular course, resources have been assigned and a timeline has been set. The content asset is placed in service when all work is complete and the curriculum could be used for instruction. Capitalized content development assets are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  The Company has concluded that the most appropriate method to amortize the deferred content assets is on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the course, which is generally 
four years
 which corresponds with course’s review and major revision cycle.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
$
658
 and $
746
, respectively, net of amortization, of deferred content assets are included in other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and amortization is included in technical and academic services where the costs originated.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for impairment, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets.  If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and evaluates the lease agreement to determine whether the lease is a finance or operating lease. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  The Company uses 
66

Table of Contents
its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement to determine the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  At lease inception, the Company determines the lease term by assuming no exercises of renewal options, due to the Company’s constantly changing geographical needs for its university partners. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and the non-lease components are accounted for separately and not included in our ROU assets and lease liabilities.  Leases primarily consist of off-campus classroom and laboratory site locations and office space.
Goodwill and Amortizable Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amount assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting unit at the education services segment, which is the same as the entity as a whole (entity level reporting unit).  The Company has concluded there is 
one
 operating segment and 
one
 reporting unit for goodwill impairment consideration.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has issued guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company reviews goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.  Following this assessment, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds its carrying amount.
Finite-lived intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value on their acquisition dates and are amortized using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset if the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliability determined. Finite-lived intangible assets consist of university partner relationships and trade names.  The Company reviews its finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable.  There were no indicators that the carrying amount of the finite-lived intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2024.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets.  If such intangible assets are not recoverable, a potential impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amounts of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share-based payment awards made to employees and directors. The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock awards is based on the market price of its common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants is expensed over the vesting period using the straight-line method for Company employees and the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”). The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and benefits and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value based on the liquidity or the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of investments was determined using Level 1 and Level 2 of the hierarchy of valuation inputs, with the use of inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets. The unit of account used for valuation is the individual underlying security. The basis of fair value measurements for each level is described below, with Level 1 having the highest priority.
-Level 1 – inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
-Level 2 – inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in non-active markets; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant valuation drivers are observable.
-Level 3 – unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
67

Table of Contents
Investments are comprised of corporate bonds, commercial paper, municipal securities, asset backed securities, municipal bonds, and collateralized mortgage obligations.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be realized.
The Company applies a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has reserved approximately $
14,626
 and $
13,631
, respectively, for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, which is classified within accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
The Company has deferred tax assets, which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income.
Commitments and Contingencies
The Company accrues for a contingent obligation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. When the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss is estimable, the Company records a liability for the estimated loss. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the potential loss is not estimable, the Company will disclose the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount of the potential loss could be material. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include tax, legal, and other regulatory matters, which are subject to change as events evolve, and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates all of its revenue through services agreements with its university partners (“Services Agreements”), pursuant to which the Company provides integrated technology and academic services, marketing and communication services, and back-office services to its university partners in return for a percentage of tuition and fee revenue.
The Company’s Services Agreements have initial terms ranging from 
7
-
15 years
, subject to renewal options, although certain agreements may give the university partners the right to terminate early if certain conditions are met.    The Company’s Services Agreements have a single performance obligation, as the promises to provide the identified services are not distinct within the context of these agreements. The single performance obligation is delivered as our partners receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over a series of distinct service periods (daily or semester). Service revenue is recognized over time using the output method of measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of the single performance obligation. The output method provides a faithful depiction of the performance toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation and can be tied to the time elapsed which is consumed evenly over the service period and is a direct measurement of the value provided to our partners. The service fees received from our partners over the term of the agreement are variable in nature in that they are dependent upon the number of students attending the university partner’s program and revenues generated from those students during the service period. Due to the variable nature of the consideration over the life of the service arrangement, the Company considered forming an expectation of the variable consideration to be received over the service life of this one performance obligation. However, since the performance obligation represents a series of distinct services, the Company recognizes the variable consideration that becomes known and billable because these fees relate to the distinct service period in which the fees are earned. The Company meets the criteria in the standard and exercises the practical expedient to not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the single performance obligation that is unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations because the directly allocable variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The service fees are calculated and settled per the terms of the Services 
68

Table of Contents
Agreements and result in a settlement duration of less than one year for all partners. There are no refunds or return rights under the Services Agreements.
The Company’s receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration from our Services Agreements with our university partners. Accounts receivable, net is stated at net realizable value and contains billed and unbilled revenue.  The Company utilizes the allowance method to provide for doubtful accounts based on its evaluation of the collectability of the amounts due. There have been 
no
 amounts written off and 
no
 reserves established as of December 31, 2024 given historical collection experience and an evaluation of reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions and other pertinent factors affecting the Company’s customers such as known credit risk or industry trends.  The Company will continue to review and revise its allowance methodology based on its collection experience with its partners. 
For our partners with unbilled revenue, revenue recognition occurs in advance of billings. Billings for some university partners do not occur until after the service period has commenced and final enrollment information is available. Our unbilled revenue of $
115
 and $
188
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets.  Deferred revenue represents the excess of amounts received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on our consolidated statements of income as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally receive payments for our services billed within 30 days of invoice. These payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered and revenue is recognized.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company records its accounts receivable at the net amount expected to be collected.  Our accounts receivable are derived through education services provided to university partners.  The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses resulting from our university partners not making payments.  The Company determines the adequacy of the allowance by periodically evaluating each university partner’s balance, considering their financial condition and credit history, and considering current and forecasted economic conditions.  Bad debt expense is recorded as a technology and academic services expense in the consolidated income statement.  The Company will continue to actively monitor other factors on expected credit losses.
Technology and Academic Services
Technology and academic services consist primarily of costs related to ongoing maintenance of educational infrastructure, including online course delivery and management, student records, assessment, customer relations management and other internal administrative systems. This also includes costs to provide support for content development, faculty training, development and other faculty support, technology support, rent and occupancy costs for university partners’ off-campus locations, and assistance with state compliance. This expense category includes salaries, benefits and share-based compensation, information technology costs, amortization of content development costs and other costs associated with these support services. This category also includes an allocation of depreciation, amortization, and occupancy costs attributable to the provision of these services, primarily at the Company’s Phoenix, Arizona and Indianapolis, Indiana locations.
Counseling Services and Support
Counseling services and support consist primarily of costs including team-based counseling and other support to prospective and current students as well as financial aid processing. This expense category includes salaries, benefits and share-based compensation, and other costs such as dues, fees and subscriptions and travel costs. This category also includes an allocation of depreciation, amortization, rent, and occupancy costs attributable to the provision of these services, primarily at the Company’s Phoenix, Arizona and Indianapolis, Indiana locations.
Marketing and Communication
Marketing and communication includes lead acquisition, digital communication strategies, brand identity advertising, media planning and strategy, video, data science and analysis, marketing to potential students and other promotional and communication services. This expense category includes salaries, benefits and share-based compensation for marketing and communication personnel, brand advertising, marketing leads and other promotional and communication expenses. This category also includes an allocation of depreciation, amortization, lease expense, and 
69

Table of Contents
occupancy costs attributable to the provision of these services, primarily at the Company’s Phoenix, Arizona and Indianapolis, Indiana locations. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses include salaries, benefits and share-based compensation of employees engaged in corporate management, finance, human resources, compliance, and other corporate functions. This category also includes an allocation of depreciation, amortization, lease expense, and occupancy costs attributable to the provision of these services, primarily at the Company’s Phoenix, Arizona and Indianapolis, Indiana locations.
Impairment and other
Impairment and other primarily includes the write-off of an internal use software project that has been terminated that it had been attempting to develop for its other university partners and costs relating to exiting from certain off-campus classroom and laboratory sites.
Insurance/Self-Insurance
The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including claims related to employee healthcare, workers’ compensation, general liability, and business interruption. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based on, among other things, historical claims experience, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The Company’s loss exposure related to self-insurance is limited by stop loss coverage on a per occurrence and aggregate basis. The Company regularly analyzes its reserves for incurred but not reported claims, and for reported but not paid claims related to self-funded insurance programs. While the Company believes reserves are adequate, significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims, average lags between the claims’ incurred date, reported dates and paid dates, and the frequency and severity of claims. There may be differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company believes the credit risk related to cash equivalents and investments is limited due to its adherence to an investment policy that required investments to have a minimum BBB rating, depending on the type of security, by 
one
 major rating agency at the time of purchase. All of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consist of investments rated BBB or higher by at least one rating agency. Additionally, the Company utilizes at least one financial institution to conduct initial and ongoing credit analysis on its investment portfolio to monitor and lower the potential impact of market risk associated with its cash equivalents and investment portfolio. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash balances, which are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $
323,124
 and $
145,474
, respectively, in excess of the FDIC insured limit
. The Company is also subject to credit risk for its accounts receivable balance.  The Company has not experienced any losses on accounts receivables since July 1, 2018, the date the Company transitioned to an education service company.  To manage accounts receivable risk, the Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, if needed.  Our dependence on our most significant university partner, with 
88.9
% and 
87.8
% of total service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, subjects us to the risk that declines in our customer’s operations would result in a sustained reduction in service revenue for the Company.
Segment Information
The Company operates as a single education services company using a core infrastructure that serves the curriculum and educational delivery needs of its university partners. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the “Chief Operating Decision Maker” or “CODM”) manages the Company’s operations as a whole and no expense or operating income information is generated or evaluated on any component level other than consolidated net income.
The education services segment generates revenue through Service Agreements with its university partners, pursuant to which the Company provides integrated technology and academic services, marketing and communication services, and back-office services to its university partners in return for a percentage of tuition and fee revenue.  
70

Table of Contents
The accounting policies of the education services segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.  The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total consolidated assets.  The CODM uses consolidated net income to monitor budget versus actual results, which is used to evaluate headcount and compensation decisions.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure,” effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted.  This ASU adds disclosure requirements for segment expense information and clarifies that single reportable segment entities are subject to Topic 280 in its entirety.  The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2024 and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or statements of cash flows.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.”  This ASU includes amendments requiring enhanced income tax disclosures, primarily related to standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or statements of cash flows.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”. ASU No. 2024-03 does not change or remove existing expense disclosure requirements but requires disaggregated disclosures about certain expense categories and captions, including but not limited to, purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and selling expenses. ASU No. 2024-03 will become effective for us in fiscal 2027 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2028 for interim reporting. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or statements of cash flows.
The Company has determined that no other recent accounting pronouncements apply to its operations or could otherwise have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
3. Investments
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had investments of $
0
 and $
98,031
, respectively, classified as available-for sale securities.  The Company sold all its investments in the third quarter of 2024 and the proceeds were invested in cash and cash equivalents.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the net realized gains were $
57
 and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, unrealized gains and losses were $
476
 and $
533
, respectively, net of taxes.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company estimates the lifetime expected credit losses for all available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position.  If our assessment indicates that an expected credit loss exists, we determine the portion of the unrealized loss attributable to credit deterioration and record a reserve for the expected credit loss in the allowance for credit losses in technology and academic services in our consolidated income statements.

6. Leases
The Company has operating leases for off-campus classroom and laboratory site locations, office space, office equipment, and optical fiber communication lines.  These leases have terms that range from 
one month
 to 
ten
 years and four months.  At lease inception, we determine the lease term by assuming 
no
 exercises of renewal options, due to the Company’s constantly changing geographical needs for its university partners.  Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets and we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The Company has operating lease costs of 
$
16,694
, $
13,496
 and $
10,666
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
17,029
 of non-cancelable operating lease commitments for 
four

off-campus classroom and laboratory sites that had not yet commenced.  The Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term relating to its operating leases is 
7.62
 years, with a weighted-average discount rate of 
4.22
%
.  The cash paid

7. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
From time to time, the Company is party to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are covered by insurance. When the Company is aware of a claim or potential claim, it assesses the likelihood of any loss or exposure. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability for the loss. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material. With respect to the majority of pending litigation matters, the Company’s ultimate legal and financial responsibility, if any, cannot be estimated with certainty and, in most cases, any potential losses related to those matters are not considered probable.
Upon resolution of any pending legal matters, the Company may incur charges in excess of presently established reserves. Management does not believe that any such charges would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Pending Litigation Matters
False Claims Act Matter
. In May 2020, the Company was served with a 
qui tam 
lawsuit that had been filed against us in 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by a former employee on behalf of the federal government. All proceedings in the lawsuit had been under seal until February 2020, when the U.S. government decided to not intervene in the lawsuit, and the complaint was then unsealed by the court. The suit, 
United States ex rel Mackillop v. Grand Canyon Education, Inc.
, alleges that we violated the False Claims Act by improperly compensating certain of our enrollment counselors in violation of the Title IV law governing compensation of such employees (the “incentive compensation rule”), and as a result, improperly received Title IV program funds. In response to a second amended complaint filed in September 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to transfer the matter to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. In December 2020, the court granted our motion to dismiss as to one of three counts and granted the motion to transfer but only upon conclusion of pretrial proceedings. In September 2021, we filed a motion for summary judgment which the Massachusetts court denied in September 2022. Subsequently, the matter was transferred to the Arizona court and trial was scheduled for late April 2024. In the interim, we filed a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling in September 2023; that motion remains pending. Prior to trial commencing, we and the relator reached an agreement to stay trial while the parties attempt to finalize the terms upon which the litigation could be concluded. Having been unsuccessful in reaching terms with the relevant parties, which would have avoided litigation, the Court has rescheduled the trial for October 2025.  For any future settlement to be affected, all parties to the litigation will need to agree on acceptable terms, both monetary and non-monetary. In this regard, because this matter involves claims under the False Claims Act, any such terms would also need to be approved by the applicable U.S. government agencies. 
We believe that the compensation practices at issue in the complaint, which were developed with the guidance of outside regulatory counsel specifically to comply with Title IV and its regulations and relevant case law interpreting the 
73

Table of Contents
incentive compensation rule, do not violate applicable law. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this legal proceeding.  The outcome of this legal proceeding is uncertain at this point.  At present, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss for this action based on the information available to the Company.  Accordingly, the Company has not accrued any liability associated with this action.
Matters Related to GCU Graduate Program Disclosures and Related Matters.
  The Company is a party to several matters alleging that, in the performance of its marketing services provided on behalf of GCU, it made false or misleading representations regarding the time to complete and the costs associated with and/or accreditation issues related to certain Grand Canyon University graduate programs, and (in the case of the FTC matter noted below) also made false or misleading representations regarding Grand Canyon University’s non-profit status and made telemarketing calls to phone numbers on do not call lists.  These matters include:
●
Smith and Wang v. Grand Canyon Education, Inc.
  This putative class action was filed in June 2024 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona and asserts claims under the federal RICO statute as well as various claims for violations of state law consumer protection statutes. On September 20, 2024, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, and on November 4, 2024, the Company moved to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss is pending with the court. There is currently no trial date scheduled in this matter.
●
Federal Trade Commission v. Grand Canyon Education, Inc., et al
. This suit was filed in late December 2023 in United States District Court for the District of Arizona and asserts claims under the FTC Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule. In February 2024, GCE filed a partial motion to dismiss, which was denied in August 2024. Discovery in this matter has commenced and is ongoing, with fact and expert discovery scheduled to conclude in May 2025 and October 2025 respectively. There is currently no trial date scheduled in this matter.
●
Ogdon v. Grand Canyon Education, Inc., et al
. This putative class action was filed in May 2020 in federal district court in California and later transferred to United States District Court for the District of Arizona and asserts claims for violations of California’s False Advertising Law, Unfair Competition Law, Consumer Legal Remedies Act; Unjust Enrichment; and purported violations of the federal RICO statute, including a conspiracy claim. The defendants include the Company along with our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.  On May 27, 2022, after significant motions practice, the Company filed an amended motion to dismiss and a motion to strike certain allegations in Plaintiff’s amended complaint. On August 8, 2023, the court presiding over the dispute entered two orders: (1) an order granting in part the Company’s motion to dismiss as to Ogdon’s RICO claim from the case and to dismiss the individual Defendants; and (2) an order granting in part the Company’s motion to strike scandalous and impertinent allegations in Ogdon’s complaint about our business. Shortly thereafter on August 22, 2023, Plaintiff moved the court to reconsider its dismissal of the RICO claim. Though discovery had commenced, and the Company substantially completed its discovery obligations on the state-law claims, discovery was stayed on March 18, 2024, pending mediation and the disposition of Ogdon’s motion for reconsideration. On March 29, 2024, the court issued an order reinstating Plaintiff’s RICO claim. On September 26, 2024, the court lifted the stay on discovery, and discovery resumed, with class certification briefing to conclude in September 2025. There is currently no trial date scheduled in this matter.
●
Valerio, et al. v. Grand Canyon Education, Inc., et al. 
This suit was filed on December 24, 2024, in Maricopa County, Arizona Superior Court on behalf of nearly 300 plaintiffs. The plaintiffs assert various claims, including claims for violations of state law consumer protection statutes. The Company’s response to the complaint is due on April 10, 2025.  There is currently no trial date scheduled in this matter.
​
We believe that the Company’s representations made in marketing materials or by our employees regarding Grand Canyon University’s non-profit status and doctoral program requirements were at all times accurate and not false or misleading, and thus did not violate applicable law. In addition, to the extent the representations we made or actions we took that are at issue in these proceedings were done or taken after July 1, 2018 at the direction of GCU and/or based on written instructions, or advertising or web materials, provided to us for use by GCU, GCU has agreed to indemnify us in part under the terms of the Master Services Agreement for our losses and expenses arising from these matters. With 
74

Table of Contents
regard to the FTC’s claims under the Telemarketing Sales Rule, we only make telemarketing calls to individuals who have demonstrated interest in speaking to us about educational opportunities at Grand Canyon University, which are permitted by the rule. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in each of these legal proceedings. The outcome of these legal proceedings is uncertain at this point. At present, the Company cannot estimate a range of loss for these actions based on the information available to the Company. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued any liability associated with these actions.
Tax Reserves, Non-Income Tax Related
From time to time the Company has exposure to various non-income tax related matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 
no
 non-income tax related matters where exposure is considered probable and the potential loss can be reasonably estimated.
8. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, consisting of stock options and restricted stock awards, for which the estimated fair value exceeds the exercise price, less shares which could have been purchased with the related proceeds, unless anti-dilutive. For employee equity awards, repurchased shares are also included for any unearned compensation adjusted for tax. The table below reflects the calculation of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, on an as if converted basis, used in computing basic and diluted earnings per common share.

, respectively, of the Company’s restricted stock awards outstanding were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. These restricted stock awards could be dilutive in the future.
9. Equity Transactions
Preferred Stock
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
10,000
 shares of authorized but unissued and undesignated preferred stock. The Company’s charter provides that the Board of Directors has authority to issue preferred stock, with voting powers, designations, preferences, and special rights, qualifications, limitation, or restrictions as permitted by law as determined by the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock.
Treasury Stock
On January 29, 2025 the Board of Directors approved a $
200,000
 increase under its existing stock repurchase program reflecting an aggregate authorization for share repurchases since the initiation of the program of $
2,245,000
. The expiration date on the repurchase authorization is 
March 1, 2026
. Repurchases occur at the Company’s discretion. Repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will be made as market and business conditions warrant.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 
1,142
 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $
165,405
.  As of December 31, 2024, there remained 
$
99,648
 available under its current share 
75

Table of Contents
repurchase authorization (which authorization was increased to $
299,648
 in January 2025).  Shares repurchased in lieu of taxes are not included in the repurchase plan totals as they were approved in conjunction with the restricted share awards.
10. Income Taxes
The Company has deferred tax assets and liabilities that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. Realization of the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The Company has 
no
 valuation allowance at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted though income tax expense.
The components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:

The Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company discloses all unrecognized tax benefits, which includes the reserves recorded for uncertain tax positions on filed tax returns and the unrecognized portion of affirmative claims. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
14,626
 and $
13,631
, respectively.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions were related to tax years that remained subject to examination by tax authorities. As of December 31, 2024, the earliest tax year still subject to examination for federal and state purposes is 2021 and 2020, respectively.
11. Share-Based Compensation Plans
Incentive Plans
The Company makes equity incentive grants pursuant to our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) under which a maximum of 
3,000
 shares may be granted. As of December 31, 2024, 
962
 shares were available for grants under the 2017 Plan.
Restricted Stock
During fiscal 
years 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company granted  
117
, 
136
, and 
189
 shares of common stock, respectively, with a service vesting condition to certain of its executives, officers, and employees. The restricted shares have voting rights and vest evenly at 
20
% 
over

each

of
 the 
next

five years
. Upon vesting, shares will be held in lieu of taxes equivalent to the statutory tax withholding required to be paid when the restricted stock vests. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company withheld 
55
, 
56
, and 
52
 shares of common stock in lieu of taxes at a cost of $
7,446
, $
6,331
, and $
4,625
, on the restricted stock vesting dates, respectively. In April 2024, a new non-employee director was appointed to the Board of Directors and was granted an initial award of shares pursuant to the Company’s compensation program. The initial award of shares that were granted to such newly appointed director have voting rights and vest on the 
one-year
 anniversary of the date of grant.  
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, following the annual stockholders meeting, the Company granted 
3
, 
4
 and 
4
 shares of common stock to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The restricted shares granted to these directors have voting rights and vest on the earlier of (a) the 
one year
 anniversary of the date of grant or (b) immediately prior to the following year’s annual stockholders’ meeting. 
On June 30, 2024, a named executive officer resigned for “good reason” which, under the terms of his employment agreement, resulted in an acceleration of the vesting of the next tranche of 
five
 outstanding restricted stock awards that would have otherwise vested on March 1, 2025.  As a result, the incremental share-based compensation expense from the modification on the 
five
 restricted stock awards for the accelerated vesting date was $
558
 and is included in the general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated income statement.  In July 2024, 
5
 shares vested and 
2
 shares were withheld in lieu of taxes at a cost of $
324
 on the accelerated vesting date.

Share-based Compensation
Share-based Compensation Expense Assumptions – Restricted Stock Awards
The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share-based payment awards made to employees and directors. The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock awards is based on the market price of its common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants is expensed over the vesting period using the straight-line method for Company employees and the Board of Directors. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. The restricted shares have voting rights.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“Principal Executive Officer”) and Chief Financial Officer (“Principal Financial Officer”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have established a Disclosure Committee, consisting of certain members of management and including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to assist in this evaluation. Our Disclosure Committee meets on a quarterly basis and more often if necessary.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation was performed on the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This Disclosure Controls and Procedures section includes information concerning management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures referred to in those certifications and, as such, should be read in conjunction with the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
(iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitation, our internal control systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in condition, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, utilizing the criteria established in the “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Based on its 
80

Table of Contents
assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Grand Canyon Education, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Grand Canyon Education, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
