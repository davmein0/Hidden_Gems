Through our subsidiaries, we serve the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets. Our operations are currently conducted through wholly-owned subsidiaries. We primarily provide electrical construction services through a network of local offices located throughout the United States and Canada. We provide a broad range of services, including design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services, with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair.
Our principal executive offices are located at 12121 Grant Street, Suite 610, Thornton, Colorado 80241. The telephone number of our principal executive offices is (303) 286-8000.
Reportable Segments
Through our subsidiaries, we are a leading specialty contractor serving the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets in the United States and Canada. We manage and report our operations through two electrical contracting service segments: Transmission and Distribution (“T&D”) and Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”). We generally focus on improving our profitability by selecting projects we believe will provide attractive margins, actively monitoring the costs of completing our projects, holding customers accountable for costs related to changes to contract specifications and rewarding our employees for effectively managing costs.
Transmission and Distribution segment.
   We have operated in the transmission and distribution industry since 1891. We are one of the largest U.S. contractors servicing the T&D sector of the electric utility industry. Our T&D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade and maintenance and repair services, with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair, to customers in the electric utility industry throughout the United States and Ontario, Canada. Our T&D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems, clean energy projects and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The T&D segment also provides emergency restoration services.
In our T&D segment, we generally serve the electric utility industry and power generation companies as a prime contractor, through traditional design-bid-build or engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) forms of project delivery. We have long-standing relationships with many of our T&D customers who rely on us to construct and maintain reliable electric and other utility infrastructure. We also provide many services to our customers under multi-year master service agreements (“MSAs”) and other variable-term service agreements.
Commercial and Industrial segment.
   We have provided electrical contracting services for commercial and industrial construction since 1912. Our C&I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting, signalization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the United States and western Canada. We concentrate our efforts on projects where our technical and project management expertise are critical to successful and timely execution. Typical C&I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities, intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting, signalization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
In our C&I segment, we generally provide our electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C&I industry, but also contract directly with facility owners. The C&I segment has a diverse customer base with many long-standing relationships.
Additional financial information related to our business segments is provided under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 17 — Segment Information to our Financial Statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Customers
Our T&D customers include many of the leading providers in the electric utility industry. These customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. Our C&I customer base includes general contractors, commercial and industrial facility owners, governmental agencies and developers.
We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, and we cultivate these relationships at all levels of our organization. We seek to build upon our customer relationships to secure additional projects from our current customer base. Many of our customer relationships originated decades ago and are maintained through a partnering approach, which includes project evaluation and consulting, quality performance, performance measurement and direct customer contact. At all levels of management, we maintain a focus on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective customers. In addition, our management teams promote and market our services for prospective large-scale projects and national accounts. We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise, customer relationships, emphasis on safety and customer service contribute to obtaining new contracts with both existing and new customers.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for 37.8%, 37.9%, and 35.4%, of our revenues, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of annual revenues.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues derived from T&D customers accounted for 55.9%, 57.3% and 58.0% of our total revenues, respectively, and revenues derived from C&I customers accounted for 44.1%, 42.7% and 42.0% of our total revenues, respectively.
Types of Service Arrangements and Bidding Process
We enter into contracts principally through a competitive bid process. Our typical construction project begins with the preparation and submission of a bid to a customer. If selected as the successful bidder, we generally enter into a contract with the customer that provides for payment upon completion of specified work or units of work as identified in the contract. Most of our contracts, including MSAs, may be terminated by our customers on short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts we undertake, our contracts are primarily structured as:
•
fixed-price agreements, under which we agree to perform the defined scope for a fixed amount;
•
unit-price agreements, under which we agree to perform the work at a fixed price per unit of work as specified in the agreement;
•
time-and-equipment and time-and-materials contracts, under which we agree to perform the work at negotiated hourly billing rates for labor and equipment and for other expenses, including materials, as incurred, at rates agreed to in the contract; and
•
cost-plus contracts, where we are paid for our costs plus a negotiated margin.
On occasion, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts include shared savings clauses, in which the contract includes a target price and we agree to share savings from that target price with our customer.
Fixed-price and unit-price contracts typically have higher potential margins; however, they hold a greater risk in terms of profitability because cost overruns may not be recoverable. Time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts have less margin upside, but generally have a lower risk of cost overruns. Work in our T&D segment is generally completed under fixed-price, time-and-materials, time-and-equipment, unit-price and cost-plus agreements. Work in our C&I segment is typically performed under fixed-price, time-and-materials, time-and-equipment, cost-plus, and unit-price agreements. Fixed-price contracts accounted for 60.3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, including 43.9% of our total revenue for our T&D segment and 81.2% of our total revenue for our C&I segment.
Our EPC contracts are typically fixed-price and may be entered into through joint ventures. We may act as the prime contractor for an EPC project where we perform the procurement and construction functions but use a subcontractor to perform the engineering component, or we may use a subcontractor for both engineering and procurement functions. We may also act as a subcontractor on an EPC project to an engineering firm or general contractor. When acting as a subcontractor for an EPC project, we typically provide construction services only, although we may also perform both the construction and procurement functions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our T&D segment also provides services under MSAs that cover maintenance, upgrade and extension services, as well as new construction. Work performed under MSAs is typically billed on a unit-price, time-and-materials or time-and-equipment basis. MSAs are typically one to three years in duration. Under MSAs, customers generally agree to contract with us for certain services in a specified geographic region. A majority of our MSAs do not include obligations to assign specific volumes of work to us nor do they grant us exclusivity, although in some cases certain work under the MSA may be subject to our right of first refusal. Many of our contracts, including MSAs, are open to bidding at expiration and generally attract numerous bidders.
A portion of the work we perform requires financial assurances in the form of performance and payment bonds, letters of credit or other guarantees at the time of execution of the contract. Many of our contracts include retention provisions of up to 10%, which are generally withheld from each progress payment as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved.
Materials
In many cases, our T&D customers are responsible for supplying materials on projects; however, under certain contracts, we may agree to provide all or a portion of the required materials. For our C&I contracts, we usually procure the necessary materials and supplies. We are not dependent on specific suppliers for materials or supplies.
Subcontracting
We are the prime contractor for the majority of our T&D projects, however, we occasionally perform work as a subcontractor, and we may elect to do so from time to time on larger projects in order to manage our execution risk. We are a subcontractor to a general contractor for the majority of our C&I projects, but may contract directly with facility owners. We may utilize subcontractors to perform portions of our contracts and to manage workflow, particularly for design and engineering under both segments.
We often work with subcontractors who are sole proprietorships or small business entities. Subcontractors normally provide their own employees, vehicles, tools and insurance coverages. We are not dependent on any single subcontractor. Our contracts with subcontractors often contain provisions limiting our obligation to pay the subcontractor if our client has not paid us. We hold our subcontractors responsible for their work or delays in their performance. When we perform work as a subcontractor we are often only paid after the general or prime contractor is paid. On larger projects, we may require performance and payment bonding from subcontractors, where we deem appropriate, based on the risk involved. 
Competition
Our business is highly competitive in both our T&D and C&I segments. Competition in both of our business segments is primarily based on the price of the construction services and upon the reputation for safety, quality and reliability of the contractor. The competition we encounter can vary depending upon the type and location of construction services.
We believe that the principal competitive factors that customers consider in our industry are:
•
price and flexible contract terms;
•
safety programs and safety performance;
•
reputation and relationships with the customer;
•
technical expertise and experience;
•
management team experience;
•
geographic presence and breadth of service offerings;
•
willingness to accept risk;
•
quality of service execution;
•
specialized equipment, tooling and centralized fleet structure;
•
the availability of qualified and licensed personnel;
•
adequate financial resources and bonding capacity;
•
technological capabilities; and
•
emergency restoration abilities and reputation.
While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, most of their work is awarded through a bid process where price is always a principal factor. See “
