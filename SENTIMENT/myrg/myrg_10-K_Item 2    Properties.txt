Item 2.    Properties
Our principal executive offices are located at 12121 Grant Street, Suite 610, Thornton, Colorado 80241, the lease term of which expires on November 30, 2029. In addition to our executive offices, certain legal, accounting and other personnel are located in this building. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 19 operating facilities and leased many other properties in various locations throughout our service territories. Most of our properties are used as operational offices or for fleet operations. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operating needs. We do not believe that any owned or leased facility is material to our operations and, if necessary, we could obtain replacement facilities for our leased facilities.
