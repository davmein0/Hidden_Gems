Item 1A.    Risk Factors
You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could affect our operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Additional risks we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also affect our operations. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be affected and our stock price could decline.

Accordingly, our operating results in any particular reporting period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other reporting period.
Our industry is highly competitive.
Our industry is fragmented and we compete with other companies, ranging from small, independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional, national and international markets. Any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors. Competition in the industry depends on many factors, including pricing of the construction services, the reputation for safety and the quality and reliability of the contractor. Some of our competitors may have lower labor and overhead cost structures and, therefore, may be able to provide their services at lower prices than ours. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technological and human resources than we do. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within the markets we serve or maintain our customer base at current levels. Additionally, we may face competition from in-house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers including electric utility companies and others which often employ personnel to internally perform some of the same types of services we do. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Negative economic and market conditions including tariffs and inflation on materials, interest rates and recessionary conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our customers’ spending and, as a result, our operations and growth.
The demand for our services from our customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the industries we serve as well as the economy in general. Stagnant or declining economic conditions could result in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and could cause our customers to outsource less work, which could adversely affect us in the future. Negative economic changes could be magnified by adverse rate cases limiting the capital expenditure budgets of our customers and leading to lower demand for our services. Additionally, many of our customers finance their projects through the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. A reduction in cash flow, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing, or a higher cost of debt or equity financing may result in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our services and may also impact the timing or ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels, or at all. A prolonged economic downturn or recession could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services. Material fluctuations in energy markets could also have an adverse impact on our customers’ spending patterns. Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric power industry may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers.
Changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy. Increases in the cost of imported raw materials or finished goods as a result of tariffs or trade policies may impact customer spending, indirect inflationary impacts, and reductions in customer spending could lead to fewer project awards and more competition We cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions, nor can we predict the timing or strength of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or its impact on our customers’ markets.

New Project and Growth Risks
We may be unsuccessful in generating internal growth, which could impact the projects available to the Company.
Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:
•
attract new customers;
•
increase the number of projects performed for existing customers;
•
hire and retain qualified personnel;
•
successfully bid new projects;
•
expand geographically; and
•
adapt the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving construction needs.
In addition, if our customers are constrained in their ability to obtain capital, it could reduce the number, timing or size of projects available to us. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful, or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations and grow our business.
Our inability to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions or joint ventures may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy and business.
From time to time, our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies or entry into joint ventures that complement or diversify our business. Future acquisition targets that meet our criteria may be limited. We may also face competition for acquisition opportunities, and other potential acquirers may offer more favorable terms or have greater financial resources available for potential acquisitions. This competition may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions, adversely impacting any accretion that might be achieved. Failure to consummate future acquisitions could negatively affect our future growth strategies. Additionally, the acquisitions we pursue may involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence or assumption of debt or burdensome regulatory requirements.
Any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may not realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of an acquisition, and our attempts at integrating an acquired business may not be successful. Acquisitions or joint ventures may expose us to operational and financial challenges and risks, including:
• the disruption of our ongoing business;
• significant diversion of resources and management’s attention from our existing business; 
• reductions of cash and other resources available for operations and other uses; 
• exposure to risks specific to the acquired businesses, services, or technologies to which we are not currently exposed; 
• the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business; 
• difficulties integrating new operations and personnel; 
• failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect; and 
• the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. 
Our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired.

Business and Operating Risks
Project performance issues, including those caused by third parties, or certain contractual obligations have in the past and may in the future result in additional costs to us, reductions or delays in revenues or the payment of penalties, including liquidated damages.
Many projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may occur over several years. We have in the past and may in the future encounter difficulties that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. These difficulties have and may continue to be the result of delays in designs; engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party; delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery; schedule changes; delays from our customer’s failure to timely obtain permits, rights-of-way or to meet other regulatory requirements; weather-related delays; delays caused by difficult worksite environments; delays caused by inefficiencies and not achieving expected labor performance and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any delay or failure by suppliers or by third-party contractors or subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs, or both. We also may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of electric transmission lines, clean energy projects, or other facilities. We may not be able to recover the costs we incur that are caused by delays. Certain contracts have guarantee provisions regarding project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations. Delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers and adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts. Larger projects present additional performance risks due to complexity of the work and duration of the project. 
Our customers have in the past and may in the future change or delay various elements of the project after its commencement. The design, engineering information, equipment or materials that are to be provided by the customer or other parties may be deficient or delivered later than required by the project schedule, resulting in additional direct or indirect costs. Under these circumstances, we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us. We are subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to change orders or failure by others to timely deliver items, such as engineering drawings or materials.
We have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to, among other things, the payment terms of our contracts and change orders relating to our contracts. These types of claims occur due to, among other things, customer-caused delays or changes in project scope, both of which may result in additional cost, which may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. Additionally, if any of our customers do not proceed with the completion of projects or default on their payment obligations, or if we encounter disputes with our customers with respect to the adequacy of billing support, we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when or if they will be fully resolved. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims in the future could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, any such claims may harm our future relationships with our customers.
We may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Our ability to maintain our productivity and our operating results may be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain qualified personnel necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. We have from time to time experienced shortages of certain types of qualified personnel, such as linemen, field supervisors, project managers and engineers, in certain regions. In addition, our projects are sometimes located in remote areas, which can make recruitment and deployment of our personnel challenging. Delays in the completion of a project could impact the labor available for other projects, reducing our productivity and causing an increase in our labor costs. Additionally, during periods with large volumes of storm restoration services work, linemen are frequently recruited across geographic regions to satisfy demand. Many linemen are willing to travel to earn premium wages for such work, which from time to time makes it difficult for us to retain these workers for ongoing projects when storm conditions persist. The commencement of new, large-scale infrastructure projects or increased demand for infrastructure improvements, as well as the shrinking electric utility workforce, may reduce the pool of skilled workers available to us. Labor shortages could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. If we are unable to hire personnel with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses.

In addition, the success of our business depends upon the continued efforts and abilities of our employees. The relationships between our employees and our customers are important to obtaining and retaining business. We are also dependent on recruiting effective personnel for our projects. There can be no assurance that any individual employee will continue in his or her capacity for any particular period of time. Industry-wide competition for managerial talent is high. Given that level of competition, there could be situations where our overall compensation package may be viewed as less attractive as compared to our competition, and we may experience the loss of key personnel or higher costs to retain and hire key personnel. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified personnel, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business and relationships with our customers.
The timing of new contracts and termination of existing contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in our cash flows and financial results.
A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from project-based work that is awarded through a competitive bid process. It is generally difficult to predict the timing and geographic distribution of the projects that we will be awarded. The selection of, timing of, or failure to obtain projects, delays in awards of projects, the re-bidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-utilization of our assets, including our fleet of construction equipment, which could lower our overall profitability and reduce our cash flows. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect when, or whether, work will begin. This can present difficulty in matching workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of a ready workforce and equipment that is larger than necessary, which could impact our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If an expected contract award or the related work release is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenues. Moreover, construction projects for which our services are contracted may require significant expenditures by us prior to receipt of relevant payments from the customer. Finally, the winding down or completion of work on significant projects that were active in previous periods will reduce our revenue and earnings if such significant projects have not been replaced in the current period.
Many of our contracts may be canceled upon short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing contracts, resulting in a decrease in our revenue, net income and liquidity. Certain of our customers assign work to us on a project-by-project basis under MSAs. Under these agreements, our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us or is canceled. Many of our contracts, including our MSAs, are open to competitive bidding at the expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re-bid.
During the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past and may in the future become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims.
We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, environmental liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers, subcontractors or other third parties. Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers’ infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on, even if our services are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system failure. Insurance coverage may not be available or may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management’s attention from our business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits and may not accurately represent future revenue.
Backlog is difficult to determine accurately, and companies within our industry may define backlog differently. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation, termination or scope adjustment by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, termination or scope adjustment, we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The timing of contract awards, duration of large new contracts and the mix of services, subcontracted work and material in our contracts can significantly affect backlog reporting. Given these factors and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone indicator. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance of our estimates of backlog. See “
