Item 3.    Legal Proceedings
We are, from time to time, party to lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, punitive damages, civil and criminal penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We are routinely subject to other civil claims, litigation and arbitration, and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of our past and present businesses as well as in respect of our divested businesses. Some of these include claims related to our services and operations, and we believe that we have strong defenses to these claims as well as insurance coverage that will contribute to any settlement or liability in the event these claims are not resolved in our favor. These claims have not had a material impact on us to date, and we believe the likelihood that a future material adverse outcome will result from these claims is remote. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future, we cannot be certain that an adverse outcome of one or more of these claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Overview-Introduction
We are a holding company of specialty electrical construction service providers that was established in 1995 through the merger of long-standing specialty contractors. Through our subsidiaries, we serve the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets. We manage and report our operations through two electrical contracting service segments: Transmission and Distribution (“T&D”) and Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”).
We have operated in the transmission and distribution industry since 1891. We are one of the largest U.S. contractors servicing the T&D sector of the electric utility industry and provide T&D services throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada. Our T&D customers include many of the leading companies in the electric utility industry. We have provided electrical contracting services for commercial and industrial construction since 1912. Our C&I segment provides services in the United States and in western Canada. Our C&I customers include general contractors and facility owners. We strive to maintain our status as a preferred provider to our T&D and C&I customers. 
We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages in both of our segments, including our skilled workforce, extensive centralized fleet, proven safety performance and reputation for timely completion of quality work that allows us to compete favorably in our markets. In addition, we believe that we are better capitalized than some of our competitors, which provides us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and more complex projects.
We had revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $3.36 billion compared to $3.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net income was $30.3 million compared to $91.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Overview-Segments
Transmission and Distribution segment
.   Our T&D segment provides comprehensive solutions to providers in the electric utility industry. Our T&D segment generally serves the electric utility industry as a prime contractor to customers such as investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. We have long-standing relationships with many of our T&D customers who rely on us to construct and maintain reliable electric and other utility infrastructure. Our T&D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks, substation facilities, clean energy projects and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade and maintenance and repair services. Our T&D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems, clean energy projects and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. We also provide many services to our customers under multi-year master service agreements (“MSAs”) and other variable-term service agreements.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our T&D revenues were $1.88 billion, or 55.9%, of our revenue, compared to $2.09 billion, or 57.3%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1.75 billion, or 58.0%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenues from transmission projects represented 60.6%, 66.1%, and 62.1% of T&D segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
28
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Our T&D segment also provides restoration services in response to hurricanes, ice storms or other storm related events, which accounted for less than 5% of our annual revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Measured by revenues in our T&D segment, we provided 43.9%, 52.7% and 47.8% of our T&D services under fixed-price contracts during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Commercial and Industrial segment
.   Our C&I segment provides a wide range of services including design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting, signalization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. In our C&I segment, we generally provide our electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C&I industry as well as directly to facility owners. We have a diverse customer base with many long-standing relationships. We concentrate our efforts on projects where our technical and project management expertise is critical to successful and timely execution. The majority of C&I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities, intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting, signalization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our C&I revenues were $1.48 billion, or 44.1%, of our revenue, compared to $1.55 billion, or 42.7%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1.26 billion, or 42.0%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Measured by revenues in our C&I segment, we provided 81.2%, 82.0% and 83.3% of our services under fixed-price contracts for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Overview-Revenue and Gross Margins
Revenue Recognition.
   We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services provided. Revenue associated with contracts with customers is recognized over time as our performance creates or enhances customer controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. To determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, we utilize the cost-to-cost method as we believe cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on our projects, and is the most common basis for computing percentage of completion in our industry. As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, we calculate the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Additionally, contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition.
Gross Margins.
   Our gross margin can vary between periods as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include: the mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve, the size and duration of our projects, the mix of business conducted in different parts of the United States and Canada, the mix of our contract types, the mix of service and maintenance work compared to new construction work, the amount of work that we subcontract, the amount of material we supply, changes in labor, equipment or insurance costs, seasonal and abnormal weather patterns, changes in fleet utilization, pricing pressures due to competition, efficiency of work performance, fluctuations in commodity prices of materials, delays in the timing of projects and other factors. The gross margins we record in the current period may not be indicative of margins in future periods.
Overview-Economic, Industry and Market Factors
We operate in competitive markets, which can result in pricing pressures for the services we provide. Work is often awarded through a bidding and selection process, where price is always a principal factor. We generally focus on managing our profitability by: selecting projects that we believe will provide attractive margins; actively monitoring the costs of completing our projects; holding customers accountable for costs related to changes to contract specifications and rewarding our employees for controlling costs.
29
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The demand for construction and maintenance services from our customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the markets we serve as well as the economy in general. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period, and regional and national economic conditions in the United States and Canada may materially affect results. Project schedules, particularly in connection with larger, multi-year projects, can also create fluctuations in our revenues. Other market and industry factors, such as changes to our customers’ capital spending plans or delays in regulatory approvals can affect project schedules. Changes in technology, tax and other incentives and new or changing regulatory requirements affecting the industries we serve can impact demand for our services. While we actively monitor economic, industry and market factors affecting our business, we cannot predict the impact such factors may have on our future results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. As a result of economic, industry and market factors, our operating results in any particular period or year may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period or for any other year.
Overview-Seasonality and Nature of Our Work Environment
Although our revenues are primarily driven by spending patterns in our customers’ industries, our revenues and results of operations, particularly those derived from our T&D segment, can be subject to seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by weather, daylight hours, availability of system outages from utilities, and holidays. During the winter months, demand for our T&D work may be high, but our work can be delayed due to inclement weather. During the summer months, the demand for our T&D work may be affected by fewer available system outages, due to peak electrical demands caused by warmer weather, which limits our ability to perform electrical line service work. During the spring and fall months, the demand for our T&D work may increase due to improved weather conditions and system availability; however, extended periods of rain and other severe weather can affect the deployment of our crews and efficiency of operations. Furthermore, our work is performed under a variety of conditions in different locations, including but not limited to, difficult terrain, sites which may have been exposed to harsh and hazardous conditions, and in large urban centers where delivery of materials and availability of labor may be impacted.
We also provide storm restoration services to our T&D customers. These services tend to have a higher profit margin. However, storm restoration service work that is performed under an MSA typically has similar rates to other work under the agreement. In addition, deploying employees on storm restoration work may, at times, delay work on other transmission and distribution work. Storm restoration service work is unpredictable and can affect results of operations.
Outlook
Our business is directly impacted by the level of spending on T&D infrastructure and the level of C&I electrical construction activity across the United States and Canada. We are optimistic about infrastructure spending and believe related investment activity will continue to positively impact both our T&D and C&I markets for the foreseeable future. We believe that regulatory reform, increased electricity demand, state clean energy portfolio standards, the aging of the electric grid, and potential overall improvement of the economy will positively impact the level of spending by our customers in all of the markets we serve. Although competition remains strong, we see these trends as positive factors for us in the future.
We believe legislative actions aimed at supporting infrastructure improvements in the United States may positively impact long-term demand, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure, transportation and clean energy spending. We believe legislative actions are likely to provide greater long-term opportunity in both of our reporting segments.
We believe there is an ongoing need for utilities to sustain investment in their transmission systems to improve reliability, reduce congestion, connect to new clean energy sources and support future load growth. Consequently, we believe we will continue to see continued bidding activity on large transmission projects going forward. The timing of multi-year transmission project awards and substantial construction activity is difficult to predict due to regulatory requirements and the permitting needed to commence construction. Significant construction on any large, multi-year projects awarded in 2025 will not likely have a large impact on our 2025 results. Bidding and construction activity for small to medium-size transmission projects and upgrades remain active, and we expect this trend to continue.
We believe there is a need for further investment by utilities on their distribution systems to properly maintain or meet reliability requirements. We continue to see strong bidding activity in some of our electric distribution markets. We believe the increased storm activity and destruction caused by wildfires will cause a push to strengthen utility distribution systems against catastrophic damage. Distribution systems may also require upgrades to accommodate additional distributed energy resources and increased electrification. We expect to see an increase in the distribution market opportunities during in 2025.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
We believe the increasing demand for electricity associated with additional power requirements, driven by increased electrification associated with new technologies, including the emergence and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies as well as increased power needs connected to the reshoring of manufacturing, will require significant investment by our customers in both of our reporting segments.
Our C&I bidding opportunities remain strong and we believe we will see continued opportunities in the primary markets we serve such as transportation, data centers, health care, clean energy and warehousing. However, we may experience unanticipated volatility associated with potential policy changes and tariffs.
In addition, the United States has experienced decades of underfunded economic expansion and aging infrastructure that have challenged the capacity of public water and transportation infrastructure forcing states and municipalities to seek creative means to fund needed expansion and repair. We believe the need for expanding public infrastructure in both the United States and Canada will offer opportunity in our C&I segment for several years. Legislation and regulation that promotes domestic manufacturing could also create opportunity for our C&I segment. We expect the long-term growth in our C&I segment to generally track the overall growth of the regions we serve.
We continued to implement strategies that further expand our capabilities and effectively allocate capital. We have maintained a strong balance sheet, while also supporting our organic growth with capital expenditures and working capital and repurchasing our shares. During 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 643,549 and 25,042 shares, respectively of its common stock under repurchase programs at a weighted-average price of $116.54 and $114.55 per share, respectively. We believe the borrowing availability under our $490 million revolving credit facility and future cash flow from operations will enable us to support the organic growth of our business, pursue acquisitions and opportunistically repurchase shares.
We continue to manage our increasing operating costs, including increasing insurance, equipment, labor and material costs. We believe that our financial position, positive cash flows and other operational strengths will enable us to respond to challenges and uncertainties in the markets we serve and give us the flexibility to successfully execute our strategy. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T&D and C&I segments and in procuring the specific specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity. In 2024 and 2023, we invested in capital expenditures of approximately $75.9 million and $84.7 million, respectively. Most of our capital expenditures supported opportunities in our T&D business. We plan to continue to evaluate our needs for additional equipment and tooling. 
Understanding Backlog
We define backlog as our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts. Backlog may not accurately represent the revenues that we expect to realize during any particular period. Several factors, such as the timing of contract awards, the type and duration of contracts, and the mix of subcontractor and material costs in our projects, can impact our backlog at any point in time. Some of our revenue does not appear in our periodic backlog reporting because the award of the project, as well as the execution of the work, can all take place within the period. For many of our unit-price, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts, we only include projected revenue for a three-month period in the calculation of backlog, although these types of contracts are generally awarded as part of MSAs that typically have a one- to three-year duration from execution. Additionally, the difference between our backlog and remaining performance obligations is due to the exclusion of a portion of our MSAs under certain contract types from our remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by us or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Our backlog includes projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Our estimated backlog also includes our proportionate share of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts.
Changes in backlog from period to period are primarily the result of fluctuations in the timing of awards, type of awards and revenue recognition of contracts. Backlog should not be relied upon as a stand-alone indicator of future events.
Understanding Gross Margins
Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting contract costs from revenue. Contract costs consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and supplies. Various factors affect our gross margins on a quarterly or annual basis, including those listed below.
31
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Performance Risk.
   Margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job productivity, which can be impacted both favorably and negatively by customer decisions and crew productivity, as well as other factors. When comparing a service contract between periods, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed, the availability of labor resources at expected labor rates and the productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity can be influenced by many factors including the experience level of the crew, whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way, weather conditions, geographical conditions, trade stacking, performance of other sub-trades, schedule changes, effects of environmental restrictions, equipment availability and regulatory and permitting delays.
Revenue Mix and Contract Terms.
   The mix of revenue derived from the industries we serve will impact gross margins. Changes in our customers’ spending patterns in each of the industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenue by industry served. Storm restoration services typically command higher profit margins than other maintenance services. Seasonal and weather factors, as noted below, can impact the timing at which customers perform maintenance and repairs, which can cause a shift in the revenue mix. Some of our time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts include shared savings clauses, in which the contract includes a target price and we agree to share savings from that target price with our customer. Additionally, new construction work has a higher gross margin than maintenance and repair work. New construction work is often obtained on a fixed-price basis, which carries a higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements because a contractor can bear the risk of increased expenses. As such, we generally bid fixed-price contracts with higher profit margins. We typically derive approximately 25% to 45% of our revenue from maintenance and repair work that is performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements which generally allow us a set margin above our costs. Thus, the mix between new construction work, at fixed-price, and maintenance and repair work, at cost-plus, in a given period will impact gross margin in that period. The timing of accounting recognition of such savings can impact our margins. In addition, change orders and claims can impact our margins. Costs related to change orders and claims are recognized in contract costs when incurred, but revenue related to change orders is only recognized when it is probable that the change order will result in an addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated, whereas revenue related to claims is recognized only to the extent that contract costs related to the claim have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in an addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated. Generally, no profit is recognized on a claim until final settlement occurs.
Seasonal, Weather and Geographical.
   Seasonal and changing patterns, primarily related to weather conditions and the availability of system outages, can have a significant impact on gross margins in a given period. It is typical during the winter months that parts of the country may experience snow or rainfall, which can affect our crews’ ability to work efficiently. Recent abnormal weather patterns including those related to excessive rainfall and increased thaw and freeze cycles also affect our crews’ ability to work efficiently. Additionally, our T&D customers often cannot remove their T&D lines from service during the summer months, when consumer demand for electricity is at its peak, delaying maintenance and repair services. In both cases, projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold. Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures are moderate, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on gross margins. The mix of business conducted in different parts of the country could also affect margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the location where the work is being performed. Such characteristics include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting; in a mountainous area or in open terrain; or in normal soil conditions or rocky terrain. Site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact margins.
Depreciation and Amortization.
   We include depreciation on equipment and finance lease amortization in contract costs. This is common practice in our industry, but can make comparability to other companies difficult. We spend a significant amount of capital on property, facilities and equipment, with the majority of such expenditures being used to purchase additional specialized equipment to enhance our fleet and to reduce our reliance on lease arrangements and short-term equipment rentals. We believe the investment in specialized equipment helps to reduce our costs, improve our margins and provide us with valuable flexibility to take on additional and complex projects.
Material and Subcontract Costs.
   Projects that include a greater amount of material or subcontractor costs can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add a lower mark-up to material and subcontractor costs in our bids than what we would to our labor and equipment cost. In addition, successful completion of our contracts may depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, we may be required to incur additional costs and provide additional services in order to make up for such shortfalls. Additionally, we are required to allocate more working capital to projects when we are required to provide materials.
32
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Insurance.
   Gross margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals related to our deductibles and loss history in the period in which such adjustments are made. We carry insurance policies, which are subject to high deductibles, for workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
Fleet Availability, Cost, Utilization, Estimation, and Bidding.
   We operate a centrally-managed fleet in the United States in an effort to control rising costs and achieve efficient equipment utilization. We also develop internal equipment rates which provide our business units with appropriate cost information to estimate bids for new projects. Availability of equipment for a particular contract is determined by our internal fleet ordering process which is designed to optimize the use of internal fleet assets and allocate equipment costs to individual contracts. We believe these processes allow us to utilize our equipment efficiently, which leads to improved gross margins. Transmission and distribution projects can require different types of equipment. A significant shift in project mix or timing could impact fleet utilization, causing gross margins to vary. 
Cost of Material.
   On fixed-price contracts where we are required to provide materials, our overall gross margin may be affected if we experience increases in the quantity or costs of materials. Projects that include a greater amount of material cost can experience lower overall project gross margins as we typically add a lower mark-up to material cost in our bids than what we would add to our labor and equipment cost.
Our team of trained estimators helps us to determine potential costs and revenues and make informed decisions on whether to bid for a project and, if bid, the rates to use in estimating the costs for that bid. The ability to accurately estimate labor, equipment, subcontracting and material costs in connection with a new project may affect the gross margins achieved for the project.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) consist primarily of compensation, related benefits and employee costs for management and administrative personnel, office rent and utilities, stock compensation, communications, professional fees, depreciation, IT expenses, marketing costs and bad debt expense.

Revenues decreased $281.6 million, or 7.7%, to $3.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $3.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $241.1 million in revenue on transmission projects, a decrease of $72.9 million in C&I revenue, partially offset by an increase of $32.4 million in revenue on distribution projects.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased to 8.6% compared to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net gross margin decrease of 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, significant estimate changes negatively impacted gross margin by 5.4% and primarily related to clean energy projects in T&D that have reached mechanical completion, the unfavorable impact of a C&I project that has reached substantial completion, labor and project inefficiencies, an increase in costs associated with schedule compression on certain projects, an unfavorable change order and an unfavorable job closeout. In addition, significant estimate changes in gross profit positively impacted gross margin by 1.0% and mainly related to better-than-anticipated productivity, favorable change orders and favorable job closeouts. Gross margin also benefited by approximately 0.2% from favorable joint venture results during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Gross profit decreased $74.1 million, or 20.3%, to $290.3 million for year ended December 31, 2024 from $364.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to lower margins and lower revenues.
SG&A was $238.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $3.6 million from $234.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses to support future growth in our operations and an increase of $1.1 million related to contingent compensation expense related to a prior acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation costs. 
Gains from the sale of property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2024 were $6.9 million compared to $4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. Gains from the sale of property and equipment are attributable to routine sales of property and equipment that are no longer useful or valuable to our ongoing operations.
Interest expense was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Other expense was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to an insignificant amount of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was largely due to foreign currency losses from changes in exchange rates on intercompany receivables.
Income tax expense was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, with an effective tax rate of 34.9%, compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, with an effective tax rate of 27.2%. The increase in the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to higher other permanent difference items and the unrecognized benefit of deferred tax assets, offset by lower stock compensation excess tax benefits. The increase in permanent difference items primarily related to deductibility limits of contingent compensation, associated with a prior acquisition.
Net income decreased to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $91.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily for the reasons stated above.

Transmission & Distribution
Revenues for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $1.88 billion compared to $2.09 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $208.7 million, or 10.0%. The decrease in revenue was related to a decrease of $241.1 million in revenue on transmission projects, primarily related to the mechanical completion of certain clean energy projects, partially offset by an increase of $32.4 million in revenue on distribution projects. Revenues from transmission projects represented 60.6% and 66.1%, of T&D segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Operating income for our T&D segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $69.4 million compared to $149.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $80.3 million, or 53.7%. As a percentage of revenues operating income for our T&D segment was 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 7.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating income margin was impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net operating income margin decrease of 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, significant estimated gross profit changes negatively impacted operating income as a percentage of revenues by 5.7% with 5.5% of the impact related to losses on certain clean energy projects that have reached mechanical completion. Losses on these projects were primarily related to contractual disputes, labor and project inefficiencies, higher labor and contract related costs and unfavorable weather conditions. Significant estimated gross profit changes were also negatively impacted by an unfavorable job closeout and labor and project inefficiencies. These decreases were partially offset by positive significant estimated gross profit changes totaling 0.2% of revenues mostly related to better-than-anticipated productivity.
Commercial & Industrial
Revenues for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $1.48 billion compared to $1.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $72.9 million, or 4.7%, primarily due to the delayed start of certain projects in 2024. The decrease in revenue included a decrease of $72.1 million in revenue on fixed priced contracts and a decrease of $12.1 million in revenues on unit price work, partially offset by an increase of $11.2 million on T&E contracts.
35
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Operating income for our C&I segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $48.0 million compared to $45.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $2.1 million, or 4.7%. Operating income, as a percentage of revenues, for our C&I segment increased to 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Operating income margin was positively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2024, by the continued benefit of higher margins on certain completed projects and certain projects nearing completion, these benefits largely related to better-than-anticipated productivity and favorable change orders. The year-over-year increase in operating income margin was positively impacted by approximately 0.4% due to favorable joint venture results. Operating income margin was also impacted by significant changes in our estimated gross profit on certain projects resulting in a net operating income margin decrease of 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net decrease of 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Significant estimated gross profit changes negatively impacted operating income as a percentage of revenues by 5.0% with 2.3% of the impact from a single project that is substantially complete. The loss from this project was primarily due to scope additions, increased labor costs related to schedule compression and lower productivity due to access and workflow issues. Significant estimated gross profit changes were also negatively impacted by an increase in costs associated with labor and project inefficiencies, schedule compression on certain projects and an unfavorable change order. These decreases were partially offset by positive significant estimated gross profit changes totaling 2.1% of revenues largely related to better-than-anticipated productivity, some of which related to clean energy projects, favorable change orders and favorable job closeouts. 
Corporate
The decrease in corporate expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in employee incentive compensation costs, partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses to support future growth in our operations.
Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA
EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by management that we define as net income plus net income from noncontrolling interests, interest expense net of interest income, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization, as shown in the following table. EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to net cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements in evaluating our operating performance and cash flow because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, useful lives placed on assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Because not all companies define EBITDA as we do, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies. We use, and we believe investors benefit from, the presentation of EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. 
Using EBITDA as a performance measure has material limitations as compared to net income, or other financial measures as defined under GAAP, as it excludes certain recurring items, which may be meaningful to investors. EBITDA excludes interest expense net of interest income; however, as we have borrowed money to finance transactions and operations, or invested available cash to generate interest income, interest expense and interest income are elements of our cost structure and can affect our ability to generate revenue and returns for our shareholders. Further, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization; however, as we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenues, depreciation and amortization are necessary elements of our costs and ability to generate revenue. Finally, EBITDA excludes income taxes; however, as we are organized as a corporation, the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations. As a result of these exclusions from EBITDA, any measure that excludes interest expense net of interest income, depreciation and amortization and income taxes has material limitations as compared to net income. When using EBITDA as a performance measure, management compensates for these limitations by comparing EBITDA to net income in each period, to allow for the comparison of the performance of the underlying core operations with the overall performance of the company on a full-cost, after-tax basis. Using both EBITDA and net income to evaluate the business allows management and investors to (a) assess our relative performance against our competitors and (b) monitor our capacity to generate returns for our shareholders.

We also use EBITDA as a liquidity measure. Certain material covenants contained within our credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) are based on EBITDA with certain additional adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement. Non-compliance with these financial covenants under the Credit Agreement — our interest coverage ratio which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by interest expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and our net leverage ratio, which is defined in the Credit Agreement as Total Net Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement), divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) — could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed on our revolving credit facility. If we anticipated a potential covenant violation, we would seek relief from our lenders, likely causing us to incur additional cost, and such relief might not be available, or if available, might not be on terms as favorable as those in the Credit Agreement. In addition, if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under the Credit Agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, making certain payments, and acquiring or disposing of assets. Based on the information above, management believes that the presentation of EBITDA as a liquidity measure is useful to investors and relevant to their assessment of our capacity to service or incur debt, fund capital expenditures, finance acquisitions and expand our operations.

Working Capital
Working capital is a non-GAAP measure. We believe working capital is useful to investors and other external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements in evaluating our operating performance. The Company defines working capital as total current assets less total current liabilities. The following table provides the Company’s calculation of working capital:

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Material Cash Requirements
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had working capital of $265.8 million and $279.0 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our operating activities provided cash of $87.1 million, compared to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by operating margins, timing of contract performance and the type of services we provide to our customers. The $16.1 million year-over-year increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $74.4 million, offset by a $60.7 million decrease in net income. The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the net favorable year-over-year changes in various working capital accounts that relate primarily to construction activities (accounts receivable, contract assets, accounts payable and contract liabilities) of $119.3 million, partially offset by the unfavorable change of $50.9 million in other liabilities. The net favorable changes of $119.3 million in cash provided by working capital accounts, mainly related to construction activities, was due to the timing of billings and payments under our contracts. The unfavorable change of $50.9 million in other liabilities was primarily due to the timing of contingent compensation payments associated with a prior acquisition, the timing of employee related wage and tax payments and lower employee incentive compensation accruals.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we used net cash of $67.2 million and $79.1 million, respectively, in investing activities. The $67.2 million of cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of $75.9 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $8.7 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. The $79.1 million of cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of $84.7 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $5.6 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we used cash of $40.0 million, and $18.4 million, respectively in financing activities. The $40.0 million of cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of $75.0 million of share repurchases under our share repurchase program, $7.1 million of payments under our equipment notes, $5.9 million of shares repurchased to satisfy tax obligations under our stock compensation programs and $1.2 million of repayments of finance lease obligations, partially offset by $45.2 million of net borrowings under our revolving line of credit. The $18.4 million of cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of $7.9 million of shares repurchased to satisfy tax obligations under our stock compensation programs, $4.6 million of net repayments under our master equipment loan agreements, $2.9 million of shares repurchases under our share repurchase program and $1.1 million of repayments of finance lease obligations. 
We believe our $354.8 million borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2024, future cash flow from operations and our ability to utilize short-term and long-term leases will provide sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs. Our primary short-term liquidity needs include cash for operations, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, and acquisition and joint venture opportunities. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our long-term liquidity needs and foreseeable material cash requirements, including those associated with funding future acquisition opportunities. We continue to invest in developing key management and craft personnel in both our T&D and C&I segments and in procuring the specific specialty equipment and tooling needed to win and execute projects of all sizes and complexity.
We have not historically paid dividends and currently do not expect to pay dividends.

Debt Instruments
Credit Agreement
On May 31, 2023, the Company entered into a five-year third amended and restated credit agreement with a maturity date of May 31, 2028, (the “Credit Agreement”) through a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A, that provides for a $490 million revolving credit facility (the “Facility”),

subject to certain financial covenants as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Facility allows for revolving loans in Canadian dollars and other non-US currencies, up to the U.S. dollars equivalent of $150 million. Up to $75 million of the Facility may be used for letters of credit, with an additional $75 million available for letters of credit, subject to the sole discretion of each issuing bank. The Facility also allows for $15 million to be used for swingline loans. The Company has an expansion option to increase the commitments under the Facility or enter into incremental term loans, subject to certain conditions, by up to an additional $200 million upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of the direct foreign subsidiaries of the Company. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s domestic subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are used to refinance existing indebtedness, and to provide for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to either (1) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00%; or (2) the Term Benchmark Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00%. The applicable margin is determined based on the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Letters of credit issued under the Facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 1.25% to 2.00% for non-performance letters of credit or 0.625% to 1.00% for performance letters of credit, based on the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio. The Company is subject to a commitment fee of 0.20% to 0.30%, based on the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio, on any unused portion of the Facility. The Credit Agreement restricts certain types of payments when the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect thereto, exceeds 2.75.
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain financial covenants including a maximum Net Leverage Ratio of 3.0 and a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 3.0. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants including limitations on asset sales, investments, indebtedness and liens. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
We had $58.4 million and $13.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Letters of Credit
Some of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers or our sureties require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors and guarantee performance under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank typically pursuant to our senior credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder claims that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $37.3 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement, including $32.6 million related to the Company's payment obligations under its insurance programs and $4.7 million related to contract performance obligations. As of December 31, 2023, we had $34.4 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement including $27.1 million related to the Company's payment obligations under its insurance programs and $7.3 million related to contract performance obligations. We are not aware of any claims currently asserted or threatened under any of these letters of credit that are material, individually, or in the aggregate. However, to the extent payment is required for any such claims, the amount paid could be material and could adversely affect cash flows.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Equipment Notes
We have entered into multiple Master Loan and Security Agreements (the "Master Loan Agreements") with multiple finance companies. The Master Loan Agreements may be used for financing of equipment between us and the lenders pursuant to one or more equipment notes (“Equipment Notes”). Each Equipment Note constitutes a separate, distinct and independent financing of equipment and contractual obligation.
As of December 31, 2024, we had one outstanding Equipment Note collateralized by equipment and vehicles owned by us. As of December 31, 2023, we had two outstanding Equipment Notes collateralized by equipment and vehicles owned by us. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had one other equipment note outstanding collateralized by a vehicle owned by us. The outstanding balance of all equipment notes was $16.0 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $4.4 million was due in the next twelve months. The outstanding balance of these equipment notes was $23.0 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $7.1 million was due in the next twelve months.
Lease Obligations
From time to time, the Company enters into non-cancelable leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow the Company to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. The Company’s leases have remaining terms ranging from less than one to nine years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to ten years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within one year. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases and many of its short-term rental arrangements. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is ongoing and the purchase option price is attractive. 
The outstanding balance of operating lease obligations was $42.6 million as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding short-term and long-term operating lease obligations of approximately $12.1 million and $30.5 million, respectively. The outstanding balance of operating lease obligations was $35.0 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding short-term and long-term operating lease obligations of approximately $9.2 million and $25.8 million, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $3.0 million outstanding finance lease obligations, consisting of short-term and long-term finance lease obligations of approximately $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had $2.3 million outstanding finance lease obligations, consisting of short-term and long-term finance lease obligations of approximately $2.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
Purchase Commitments for Construction Equipment
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $4.9 million in outstanding purchase obligations for certain construction equipment to be paid with cash outlays scheduled to occur in 2025.
Performance and Payment Bonds and Parent Guarantees
Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds typically issued by a surety or insurance company. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the respective issuers of the bonds for any claim expenses or outlays they incur. Under our continuing indemnity and security agreements with the issuers of the bonds, we may be required to grant them a security interest relating to a particular project. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund significant claims under our surety arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of approximately $2.27 billion in original face amount of bonds issued by our sureties were outstanding. Our estimated remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $662.6 million as of December 31, 2024.
From time to time we guarantee the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements, and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors’ licenses. Additionally, from time to time we are required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under our credit facility.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Concentration of Credit Risk
We grant trade credit under contractual payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include high credit quality electric utilities, governmental entities, general contractors and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located in the United States and Canada. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States and Canada. However, we generally have certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of December 31, 2024, one customer individually exceeded 10.0% of our accounts receivable with approximately of 11.3% of the total accounts receivable amount (excluding the impact of allowance for doubtful accounts). As of December 31, 2023, none of our customers individually exceeded 10.0% of our accounts receivable.

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Financial Statements:
Revenue Recognition.
   We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services provided. Revenue associated with contracts with customers is recognized over time as our performance creates or enhances customer-controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. To determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, we estimate profit by determining the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract. In addition, we estimate a cost accrual every quarter that represents unbilled invoicing activity for services performed by subcontractors and suppliers during the quarter, and estimate revenue from the contract cost portion of this accrual based on current gross margin rates to be consistent with our cost method of revenue recognition. The estimated value of unbilled amounts are determined using a regression analysis that estimates value based on our historical experience, and is adjusted for large individual projects. The profit and corresponding revenue is recognized over the contract term based on costs incurred under the cost-to-cost method. We utilized the cost-to-cost method as we believe cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on our projects, and is the most common basis for computing percentage of completion in our industry. For purposes of recognizing revenue, we follow the five-step approach outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606.
As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, we calculate the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Because our billings are based on contract terms and do not coincide with our progress in a project, revenue recognition also includes an amount related to our contract asset or contract liability. If the recognized revenue is greater than the amount billed to the customer, a contract asset is recorded. Additionally, the contract asset includes retainage billed to the customer that cannot be collected until the contract work has been completed and approved. Conversely, if the amount billed to the customer is greater than the recognized revenue, a contract liability is recorded. Additionally, the contract liability includes a liability for the excess of costs over revenues for all contracts that are in a loss position.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. Additionally, we estimate costs to complete on fixed price contracts which are determined on an individual contract basis by evaluating each project’s status as of the balance sheet date, and using our historical experience with the level of effort required to complete the underlying project. Claims and change orders are also measured based on our historical experience with individual customers and similar contracts, and are evaluated by management individually. A change order is a modification to a contract that changes the provisions of the contract, typically resulting from changes in scope, specifications, design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work under the contract. A claim is an amount in excess of the agreed-upon contract price that we seek to collect from our clients or others for client-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes. We include these estimated amounts of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenues of $46.0 million and $76.5 million, respectively, related to significant change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts, some of which are multi-year projects.
Some of our contracts may have contract terms that include variable consideration such as safety or performance bonuses or liquidated damages. In accordance with ASC 606, we estimate the variable consideration using one of two methods. In contracts in which there is a binary outcome, the most likely amount method is used. In instances in which there is a range of possible outcomes, the expected value method is used. In accordance with ASC 606, we include the estimated amount of variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative recognized revenue will not occur when the final outcome of the variable consideration is determined. In contracts in which a significant reversal may occur, we use constraint in recognizing revenue on variable consideration. We often enter into contracts that contain liquidated damage clauses. We do not include amounts associated with liquidated damage clauses until it is probable that liquidated damages will occur. These items are continually monitored by multiple levels of management throughout the reporting period.
A portion of the work we perform requires financial assurances in the form of performance and payment bonds or letters of credit at the time of execution of the contract. Many of our contracts include retention provisions of up to 10%, which are generally withheld from each progress payment as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved.
The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a detailed “bottoms up” approach and we believe our experience typically allows us to provide materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include, among others:
•
the completeness and accuracy of the original bid;
•
costs associated with scope changes, change orders or claims;
•
costs of labor and/or materials;
•
extended overhead due to owner, weather and other delays;
•
subcontractor performance issues;
•
changes in productivity expectations;
•
site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid (to the extent contract remedies are unavailable);
•
the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project; and 
•
a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials.
The foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods. During the year ended December 31, 2024, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 4.4%. During the year ended December 31, 2023, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 1.7%. During the year ended December 31, 2022, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 0.4%.
We provide warranties to customers on a basis customary to the industry; however, the warranty period does not typically exceed one year. Historically, warranty claims have not been material. 
Total revenues do not include sales tax as we consider ourselves a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Sales tax and value added tax collected from customers is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Insurance.
   We carry insurance policies, which are subject to certain deductibles, for workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. Our deductible for each line of coverage is up to $1.0 million. Certain health benefit plans are subject to stop-loss limits of up to $0.2 million, for qualified individuals. Losses up to the deductible and stop-loss amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends. While recorded accruals are based on the ultimate liability, which includes amounts in excess of the deductible, a corresponding receivable for amounts in excess of the deductible is included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Stock-Based Compensation.
   We determine compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair values at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize compensation expense related to stock-based awards, such as restricted stock units, that have only service conditions. This method recognizes stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. We recognize compensation expense related to performance awards that vest based on internal performance metrics and service conditions on a straight-line basis over the service period, but adjust inception-to-date expense based upon our determination of the expected achievement of the performance target at each reporting date which may vary from zero to 200% of the target performance awards. We recognize compensation expense related to performance awards with market-based performance metrics on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. Shares issued under the Company’s stock-based compensation program are taken out of authorized but unissued shares.
Goodwill and Intangibles.
   Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We perform either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis. This assessment is performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or when circumstances change, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or the decision to sell a business, both of which would indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are also reviewed for impairment and tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
A qualitative assessment considers financial, industry, segment and macroeconomic factors, if the qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative assessment is performed to determine if impairment exists. The quantitative assessment begins with a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit or intangible asset. If the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded in the statement of operations.
As a result of the annual qualitative review process in 2023 and 2022, we determined it was not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. In 2024, we performed a quantitative assessment on our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives; this assessment did not indicate that our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
   We do not generally charge interest to our customers, and we carry our customer receivables at their face amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on our experience in recent years, the majority of customer balances at each balance sheet date are collected within twelve months. As is common practice in the industry, we classify all accounts receivable as current assets. The allowance for doubtful accounts associated with account receivables was $1.1 million as of December 31, 2024 and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2023.
We grant trade credit, on a non-collateralized basis (with the exception of lien rights against the property in certain cases) to our customers, and we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and overall economic activity. We analyze specific accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In the event that a customer balance is deemed to be uncollectible the account balance is written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We have operations within the United States and Canada, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.
As of December 31, 2024, we were not party to any derivative instruments. We did not use any material derivative financial instruments during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022, including instruments for trading, hedging, or speculating on changes in interest rates, changes in foreign currency rates or changes in commodity prices of materials used in our business.
Any borrowings under our Facility are based upon interest rates that will vary depending upon the prime rate, Canadian prime rate, the NYFRB overnight bank funding rate, Term CORRA, and Term SOFR Reference Rate. If the prime rate, Canadian prime rate, the NYFRB overnight bank funding rate, Term CORRA, or Term SOFR Reference Rate rises, any interest payment obligations would increase and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition. We currently do not maintain any hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest when we have outstanding borrowings. As of December 31, 2024, we had $58.4 million of borrowings under our Facility. If market rates of interest on all our revolving debt as of December 31, 2024, which is subject to variable rates, permanently increased by 1%, the increase in interest expense on all revolving debt would decrease future income before provision for income taxes and cash flows by approximately $0.6 million annually. If market rates of interest on all our revolving debt, which is subject to variable rates as of December 31, 2024, permanently decreased by 1%, the decrease in interest expense on all debt would increase future income before provision for income taxes and cash flows by approximately $0.6 million annually.
Borrowings under our Equipment Notes are at fixed rates established on the date the note was executed.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Crowe LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the 2024 Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of MYR Group’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and has issued an attestation report on MYR Group’s internal control over financial reporting which appears herein.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MYR Group Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The

communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Evaluation of estimated costs to complete and variable consideration for fixed price construction contracts, including changes to estimates
As described in Note 1 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Organization, Business, and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenue on fixed price construction projects over time using the cost-to-cost method, which measures the progress as the ratio of actual contract costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion. The amount of contract revenues and gross profit recognized on fixed price construction contracts is dependent on the contract price, the actual contract costs incurred, and the forecasted contract revenues and contract costs for construction projects. The recognition of revenue on fixed price construction contracts involves significant estimates due to the unique complexities of each construction project, uncertainty about estimates of costs to complete which can include unforeseen delays or construction complications, and uncertainty in the outcome of discussions with customers on the valuation of change orders and claims. The Company recognizes revenue related to change orders only when it is probable that the change order will result in an addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated. The Company evaluates change orders and claims based on historical experience with the customer, similar contracts, and on an individual basis, which involves significant judgment. The Company recognizes these estimated amounts of variable consideration in transaction price to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. The Company reviews and revises, as needed, the estimated costs to complete and variable consideration for fixed price construction contacts while contracts are in process and through the date of contract completion. 
We identified auditing management’s estimates of variable consideration for change orders and claims, management’s estimates of costs to complete, and management’s assessment of changes to estimates of costs to complete on select fixed price construction contracts to be a critical audit matter. The critical audit matter relates to select fixed price construction contracts based on the magnitude of estimated costs to complete, the magnitude of variable consideration for change orders and claims, the stage of completion of the contract, and the significance of any changes to estimates of costs to complete. Estimates of variable consideration for change orders and claims and estimated costs to complete, including changes to estimates, require management to make assumptions about future events and, as a result, a high degree of auditor judgment is involved in auditing these estimates. Due to the factors above, auditing management’s estimates of costs to complete, variable consideration, and changes to estimates of costs to complete required extensive audit effort. 
Our audit procedures to address the critical audit matter included the following: 
–
Tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of controls that are designed to address the reasonableness of estimates of costs to complete contracts, estimates of variable consideration recognized on contracts, and changes to estimated costs to complete;
–
Evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates of cost to complete for a sample of fixed price construction contracts through testing the key components of the estimated costs to complete, including materials, labor, and subcontractor costs; 
–
Agreed a sample of contract costs incurred to supporting documentation; 
–
Performed inquiries of management and project personnel regarding facts and circumstances relevant to the accounting for such contracts;
–
Recalculated revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion of projects;
–
Evaluated variable consideration recognized related to construction projects by comparing estimates made by management to subsequent actual data, evaluating the contracts and other documents that support estimates made by management, and obtaining legal opinions from internal and external counsel;
–
Performed retrospective review procedures to assess management’s historical ability to accurately estimate the transaction price and cost to complete of construction contracts; and
–
Obtained and evaluated evidence that changes to estimates of costs to complete contracts were recorded in the appropriate period.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
MYR GROUP INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Organization, Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Business
MYR Group Inc. (the “Company”) is a holding company of specialty electrical construction service providers conducting operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company performs construction services in 
two
 business segments: Transmission and Distribution (“T&D”) and Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”). T&D customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. T&D provides a broad range of services on electric transmission, distribution networks, substation facilities, clean energy projects and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. T&D services include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services. C&I customers include general contractors, commercial and industrial facility owners, government agencies and developers. C&I provides a broad range of services, which include design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring. Typical C&I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities, intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting, signalization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation
The accompanying Financial Statements include the results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services provided. Revenue associated with contracts with customers is recognized over time as the Company’s performance creates or enhances customer-controlled assets or creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. To determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company estimates profit by determining the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract. In addition, the Company estimates a cost accrual every quarter that represents unbilled invoicing activity for services performed by subcontractors and suppliers during the quarter, and estimates revenue from the contract cost portion of this accrual based on current gross margin rates to be consistent with its cost method of revenue recognition. The estimated value of unbilled amounts are determined using a regression analysis that estimates value based on the Company’s historical experience, and is adjusted for large individual projects. The profit and corresponding revenue is recognized over the contract term based on costs incurred under the cost-to-cost method. The Company utilizes the cost-to-cost method as it believes cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on projects, and is the most common basis for computing percentage of completion in the industry. For purposes of recognizing revenue, the Company follows the five-step approach outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606.
As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, the Company calculates the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by estimated revenues to determine inception-to-date revenue. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined and the amount of the loss is updated in subsequent reporting periods. Because the Company’s billings are based on contract terms and do not coincide with our progress in a project, revenue recognition also includes an amount related to a contract asset or contract liability. If the recognized revenue is greater than the amount billed to the customer, a contract asset is recorded. Additionally, the contract asset includes retainage billed to the customer that cannot be collected until the contract work has been completed and approved. Conversely, if the amount billed to the customer is greater than the recognized revenue, a contract liability is recorded. Additionally, the contract liability includes a liability for the excess of costs over revenues for all contracts that are in a loss position.
53
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract. Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. Additionally, the Company estimates costs to complete on fixed price contracts which are determined on an individual contract basis by evaluating each project’s status as of the balance sheet date, and using our historical experience with the level of effort required to complete the underlying project. Claims and change orders are also measured based on our historical experience with individual customers and similar contracts, and are evaluated by management individually. A change order is a modification to a contract that changes the provisions of the contract, typically resulting from changes in scope, specifications, design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites, or period of completion of the work under the contract. A claim is an amount in excess of the agreed-upon contract price that the Company seeks to collect from its clients or others for client-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes. The Company includes these estimated amounts of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenues related to significant variable consideration of $
29.9
 million and $
76.5
 million, respectively.
Some of the Company’s contracts may have contract terms that include variable consideration such as safety or performance bonuses or liquidated damages. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company estimates the variable consideration using one of two methods. In contracts in which there is a binary outcome, the most likely amount method is used. In instances in which there is a range of possible outcomes, the expected value method is used. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company includes the estimated amount of variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative recognized revenue will not occur when the final outcome of the variable consideration is determined. In contracts in which a significant reversal may occur, the Company uses constraint in recognizing revenue on variable consideration. The Company often enters into contracts that contain liquidated damage clauses. The Company does not include amounts associated with liquidated damage clauses until it is probable that liquidated damages will occur. These items are continually monitored by multiple levels of management throughout the reporting period.
A portion of the work the Company performs requires financial assurances in the form of performance and payment bonds or letters of credit at the time of execution of the contract. Many of the Company’s contracts include retention provisions of up to 
10
%, which are generally withheld from each progress payment as retainage until the contract work has been completed and approved.
The Company provides warranties to customers on a basis customary to the industry; however, the warranty period does not typically exceed 
one year
. Historically, warranty claims have not been material to the Company. Based on the Company’s estimates, as of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded warranty reserves of $
3.4
 million and as of December 31, 2023, warranty reserves were 
no
t significant. Settlements on warranty claims during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were 
no
t significant.
Total revenues do not include sales tax as the Company considers itself a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. Sales tax collected from customers is included in other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Joint Ventures and Noncontrolling Interests
The Company accounts for investments in joint ventures using the proportionate consolidation method for income statement reporting and under the equity method for balance sheet reporting, unless the Company has a controlling interest causing the joint venture to be consolidated with equity owned by other joint venture partners recorded as noncontrolling interests. Under the proportionate consolidation method, joint venture activity is allocated to the appropriate line items found on the consolidated statements of operations in proportion to the percentage of participation the Company has in the joint venture. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized its proportionate share of joint venture revenues of $
22.4
 million, $
33.0
 million, and $
11.3
 million, respectively. Under the equity method the net investment in joint ventures is stated as a single item on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. If an investment in a joint venture contains a recourse or unfunded commitment to provide additional equity, distributions and/or losses in excess of the investment a liability is recorded in other current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. 
54
TABLE OF CONTENTS
For joint ventures which the Company does not have a controlling interest, the Company’s share of any profits and assets and its share of any losses and liabilities are recognized based on the Company’s stated percentage partnership interest in the joint venture and are normally recorded by the Company one month in arrears. The investments in joint ventures are recorded at cost and the carrying amounts are adjusted to recognize the Company’s proportionate share of cumulative income or loss, additional contributions made and dividends and capital distributions received. The Company records the effect of any impairment or any other-than-temporary decrease in the value of the joint venture investment as incurred, which may or may not be one month in arrears, depending on when the Company obtains the joint venture activity information. Additionally, the Company continually assesses the fair value of its investment in unconsolidated joint ventures despite using information that is one month in arrears for regular reporting purposes. The Company includes only its percentage ownership of each joint venture in its backlog.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency for the Company’s Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in Canadian dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the end-of-period exchange rate. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the periods reported. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Cumulative translation adjustments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, arising primarily from changes in exchange rates on short-term monetary assets and liabilities, and intercompany loans that are not deemed long-term investment accounts are recorded in the “other income (expense), net” line on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency losses recorded in other income (expense), net, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
1.4
 million, $
0.1
 million and $
0.2
 million, respectively. Foreign currency translation gains and losses, arising from intercompany loans that are deemed long-term investment accounts, are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment line on the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates are related to estimates of costs to complete on contracts, variable consideration inclusive of pending change orders and claims, shared savings, insurance reserves, income tax reserves, estimates surrounding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related contingent earn-out consideration liabilities, the recoverability of goodwill and intangibles and allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company estimates a cost accrual every period that represents costs incurred but not invoiced for services performed or goods delivered during the period, and estimates revenue from the contract cost portion of these accruals based on current gross margin rates to be consistent with its cost method of revenue recognition.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized revenues of $
46.0
 million and $
76.5
 million, respectively, related to significant change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts, some of which are multi-year projects. These change orders and/or claims are in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business, and a portion of these recognized revenues had been included in multiple periods. These aggregate amounts, which were included in “Contract assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, represent the Company’s estimates of additional contract revenues that were earned and probable of collection; however, the amount ultimately realized could be significantly higher or lower than the estimated amount.
The cost-to-cost method of accounting requires the Company to make estimates about the expected revenue and gross profit on each of its contracts in process. During the year ended December 31, 2024, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 
4.4
%, which resulted in decreases in operating income of $
146.5
 million, net income of $
96.9
 million and diluted earnings per common share of $
5.86
. The estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly, as needed. Additional discussion on the impact of these estimate changes can be found in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
During the year ended December 31, 2023, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 
1.7
%, which resulted in decreases in operating income of $
62.2
 million, net income of $
43.6
 million and diluted earnings per common share of $
2.59
. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, changes in estimates pertaining to certain projects decreased consolidated gross margin by 
0.4
%, which resulted in decreases in operating income of $
9.8
 million, net income of $
6.9
 million and diluted earnings per common share of $
0.41
.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $
2.0
 million, $
1.8
 million and $
1.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. The Company also evaluates whether the recorded deferred tax assets and valuation allowances can be realized and, when necessary, reduces the amounts to what is expected to be realized.
Interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions are included in income tax expense on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Interest and penalties actually incurred are charged to the interest expense and the “other income (expense), net” line, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company determines compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the estimated fair values at the grant date and recognizes the related compensation expense over the vesting period. The Company uses the straight-line amortization method to recognize compensation expense related to stock-based awards, such as restricted stock units, that have only service conditions. This method recognizes stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to performance awards that vest based on internal performance metrics and service conditions on a straight-line basis over the service period, but adjusts inception-to-date expense based upon our determination of the potential achievement of the performance target at each reporting date. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to performance awards with market-based performance metrics on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Shares issued under the Company’s stock-based compensation program are taken out of authorized but unissued shares.
Earnings Per Share
The Company computes earnings per share using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent would be anti-dilutive.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held its cash in checking accounts or in highly liquid money market accounts. The Company’s banking arrangements allow the Company to fund outstanding checks when presented to financial institutions for payment. The Company funds all intraday bank balance overdrafts during the same business day. Checks issued and outstanding in excess of bank balances are recorded in accounts payable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as a financing activity on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company does not charge interest to its customers and carries its customer receivables at their face amounts, net of contract retainage, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on the Company’s experience in recent years, the majority of customer balances at each balance sheet date are collected within twelve months. As is common practice in the industry, the Company classifies all accounts receivable as current assets.
The Company grants trade credit, on a non-collateralized basis (with the exception of lien rights against the property in certain cases), to its customers and is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and overall economic activity. The Company analyzes specific accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In the event that a customer balance is deemed to be uncollectible, the account balance is written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.
56
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Classification of Contract Assets and Liabilities
The Company recognizes revenue associated with its contracts with customers over time, for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation. Many of our contracts contain specific provisions that determine when the Company can bill for its work performed under these contracts.
Any revenue earned on a contract that has not yet been billed to the customer is recorded as a contract asset on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Contract retainages associated with contract work that has been completed and billed but not paid by its customers until the contracts are substantially complete, pursuant to contract retainage provisions under the contract, are also included in contract assets.
The Company’s consolidated balance sheets present contract liabilities that contain deferred revenue that represent any costs incurred on contracts in process for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Additionally, accruals for contracts in a loss provision are included in contract liabilities.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is carried at cost, except for assets acquired in a business combination which are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Major modifications or refurbishments which extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income from operations. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment and tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of property and equipment exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded in the statement of operations.
Leases
The Company enters into non-cancelable leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow the Company to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. The Company’s leases have remaining terms ranging from less than 
one
 to 
nine years
, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 
ten years
, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within 
one year
. Currently, all the Company’s leases contain fixed payment terms. The Company may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. Additionally, all of the Company’s month-to-month leases are cancelable, by the Company or the lessor, at any time and are not included in our right-of-use asset or liability. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had several leases with residual value guarantees. The total amount probable of being owed of residual leases guarantees is not significant. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases and many of its short-term rental arrangements. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is ongoing and the purchase option price is attractive. Nonperformance-related default covenants, cross-default provisions, subjective default provisions and material adverse change clauses contained in material lease agreements, if any, are also evaluated to determine whether those clauses affect lease classification in accordance with ASC Topic 842. Leases are accounted for as operating or finance leases, depending on the terms of the lease.
Finance Leases.
   The Company leases some vehicles and certain equipment under finance leases. The economic substance of the leases is a financing transaction for acquisition of the vehicles and equipment. Accordingly, the right-of-use assets for these leases are included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets in property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, with a corresponding amount recorded in current portion of finance lease obligations or finance lease obligations, net of current maturities, as appropriate. The finance lease assets are amortized over the life of the lease or, if shorter, the life of the leased asset, on a straight-line basis and included in depreciation expense. The financing component associated with finance lease obligations is included in interest expense. Generally, for the Company’s finance leases an implicit rate to calculate present value is provided in the lease agreement. However, if a rate is not provided the Company determines this rate by estimating the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, utilizing the borrowing rates associated with the Company’s various debt instruments.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Operating Right-of-Use Leases.
   Operating right-of-use leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, current portion of operating lease obligations and operating lease obligations, net of current maturities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate to calculate present value, the Company determines this rate by estimating the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, utilizing the borrowing rates associated with the Company’s various debt instruments. The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which are considered in the present value calculations when it is reasonably certain we will exercise those options.

Insurance
The Company carries insurance policies, which are subject to certain deductibles, for workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other coverages. The deductible for each line of coverage is up to $
1.0
 million. Certain health benefit plans are subject to a stop-loss limit of up to $
0.2
 million, for qualified individuals. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon the Company’s estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends. While recorded accruals are based on the ultimate liability, which includes amounts in excess of the deductible, a corresponding receivable for amounts in excess of the deductible is included in current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company performs either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis. This assessment is performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or when circumstances change, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or the decision to sell a business, both of which would indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are also reviewed for impairment and tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
A qualitative assessment considers financial, industry, segment and macroeconomic factors. If the qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative assessment is performed to determine if impairment exists. The quantitative assessment begins with a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit or intangible asset. If the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded in the statement of operations.
As a result of the annual qualitative review process in 2023 and 2022, the Company determined it was not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment. In 2024, the Company performed a quantitative assessment on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, this assessment did not indicate that the Company’s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired.
Concentrations
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains substantially all of its cash and cash equivalent balances with large financial institutions which are believed to be high quality institutions.
The Company is subject to a concentration of risk because it derives a significant portion of its revenues from a few customers. The Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 
37.8
%, 
37.9
%, and 
35.4
% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of annual revenues.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Company grants trade credit under contractual payment terms, generally without collateral, to its customers, which include high credit quality electric utilities, governmental entities, general contractors and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties. Consequently, the Company is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors. However, the Company generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements, the Company may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of December 31, 2024, one customer individually exceeded 10.0% of accounts receivable with approximately 
11.3
% of the total accounts receivable amount (excluding the impact of allowance for doubtful accounts). As of December 31, 2023, none of the Company’s customers individually exceeded 10.0% of accounts receivable. The Company believes the terms and conditions in its contracts, billing and collection policies are adequate to minimize the potential credit risk.
As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
87
% of the Company’s craft labor employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, the Company cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future.

Acquisition
Powerline Plus Ltd
On January 4, 2022, the Company acquired all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Powerline Plus Ltd. and its affiliate PLP Redimix Ltd. (collectively, the “Powerline Plus Companies"), a full-service electrical distribution construction company based in Toronto, Ontario. Cash consideration paid, funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Facility (as defined below), including $
0.1
 million of net asset and other adjustments, was $
110.7
 million, net of cash acquired. The Company finalized the purchase price accounting relating to the acquisition of the Powerline Plus Companies during the year ended December 31, 2022.
59
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Additionally, the acquisition includes contingent earn-out consideration that may be payable if the Powerline Plus Companies achieve certain performance targets over a 
three-year
 post-acquisition period. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was $
0.9
 million. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration was 
zero
. The minimum thresholds of the performance targets were not achieved, and therefor no future payout of contingent earn-out consideration is necessary. Changes in contingent earn-out consideration, subsequent to the acquisition, of 
zero
, $
0.2
 million and $
0.7
 million were recorded in other income, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The results of the Powerline Plus Companies are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning on the transaction date. 
The purchase agreement also includes contingent consideration provisions for down-side margin guarantee adjustments based upon certain contract performance subsequent to the acquisition. The contracts were valued at fair value at the acquisition date, causing no margin guarantee estimate or adjustments for fair value. Unfavorable changes in contract estimates, such as modified costs to complete or change order recognition, will result in changes to these margin guarantee estimates. 
No
 changes in margin guarantee adjustments on contracts, subsequent to the acquisition, have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. No margin guarantee adjustments will be recognized in other income in 2025.

The acquisition date fair values of intangible assets were determined using the income approach, which discounts the projected future cash flows using a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks associated with the projected cash flows. Under the income approach, the acquisition date fair value of the customer relationships and backlog were estimated using a multi-period excess earnings valuation method and the acquisition date fair value of the trade names was estimated using a relief from royalty valuation method. The fair value of the acquired operating lease obligation and operating right of use asset was estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value of the operating lease obligation was determined by comparing the difference between the annual lease contract rent over the remaining contractual term to a market rate cash flow stream, discounted to the present value. The Company calculated the fair value of the operating right of use asset based on the fair values of the operating lease obligation adjusted for a below market lease positions. The contractual value of the acquired accounts receivable is equal to the fair market value.

Contract Assets and Liabilities
Contracts with customers usually stipulate the timing of payment, which is defined by the terms found within the various contracts under which work was performed during the period. Therefore, contract assets and liabilities are created when the timing of costs incurred on work performed does not coincide with the billing terms. These contracts frequently include retention provisions contained in each contract.
The Company’s consolidated balance sheets present contract assets, which contain unbilled revenue and contract retainages associated with contract work that has been completed and billed but not paid by customers, pursuant to retainage provisions, that are generally due once the job is completed and approved. The allowance for doubtful accounts associated with contract assets was $
0.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and $
0.6
 million as of December 31, 2023.

Lease Obligations
From time to time, the Company enters into non-cancelable leases for some of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow the Company to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for the use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. The Company’s leases have remaining terms ranging from less than 
one
 to 
nine years
, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 
ten years
, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within 
one year
. Currently, all the Company’s leases contain fixed payment terms. The Company may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. Additionally, all of the Company's month-to-month leases are cancelable, by the Company or the lessor, at any time and are not included in our right-of-use asset or liability. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had several leases with residual value guarantees. Typically, the Company has purchase options on the equipment underlying its long-term leases and many of its short-term rental arrangements. The Company may exercise some of these purchase options when the need for equipment is ongoing and the purchase option price is attractive. Leases are accounted for as operating or finance leases, depending on the terms of the lease.

The financing component for finance lease obligations represents the interest component of finance leases that will be recognized as interest expense in future periods. The financing component for operating lease obligations represents the effect of discounting the lease payments to their present value.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company have operating leases for facilities from third party companies that are owned, in whole or part, by employees of the subsidiaries. The terms and rental rates of these leases are at market rental rates. Lease expense associated with these leases was $
2.5
 million, $
2.7
 million and $
2.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the minimum lease payments required under these leases totaled $
10.0
 million, which are due over the next 
4.7
 years.
5. 
Fair Value Measurements
The Company uses the three-tier hierarchy of fair value measurement, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value based upon their degree of availability in external active markets. These tiers include: Level 1 (the highest priority), defined as observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3 (the lowest priority), defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value based on Level 1 inputs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt and finance lease obligations were based on Level 2 inputs. The Company’s long-term debt was based on variable and fixed interest rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Long-term debt with variable interest rates is based on rates for new issues with similar remaining maturities, and approximated carrying value. In addition, based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for borrowings with similar terms, the carrying value of the Company’s long term debt with fixed interest rates approximated fair value.
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Company’s contingent earn-out consideration liability associated with the acquisition of the Powerline Plus Companies, was based on Level 3 inputs. The contingent earn-out consideration recorded represents the estimated fair value of future amounts potentially payable to the former owners of the acquired Powerline Plus Companies, if the Powerline Plus Companies achieve certain performance targets over a three-year post-acquisition period. The fair value was initially determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology based on probability-weighted performance projections and other inputs, including a discount rate and an expected volatility factor. The fair value of this contingent earn-out consideration liability will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by management. Accordingly, the level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level (Level 3). Significant changes in any of these assumptions could result in a significantly higher or lower potential liability.

Credit Agreement
On May 31, 2023, the Company entered into a 
five-year
 third amended and restated credit agreement with a maturity date of May 31, 2028, (the “Credit Agreement”) through a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A, that provides for a $
490
 million revolving credit facility (the “Facility”),

subject to certain financial covenants as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Facility allows for revolving loans in Canadian dollars and other non-US currencies, up to the U.S. dollars equivalent of $
150
 million. Up to $
75
 million of the Facility may be used for letters of credit, with an additional $
75
 million available for letters of credit, subject to the sole discretion of each issuing bank. The Facility also allows for $
15
 million to be used for swingline loans. The Company has an expansion option to increase the commitments under the Facility or enter into incremental term loans, subject to certain conditions, by up to an additional $
200
 million upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries, and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries and 
65
% of the capital stock of the direct foreign subsidiaries of the Company. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s domestic subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, amounts outstanding under the Facility may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are used to refinance existing indebtedness, and to provide for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
67
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to either (1) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 
0.25
% to 
1.00
%; or (2) the Term Benchmark Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin ranging from 
1.25
% to 
2.00
%. The applicable margin is determined based on the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Letters of credit issued under the Facility are subject to a letter of credit fee of 
1.25
% to 
2.00
% for non-performance letters of credit or 
0.625
% to 
1.00
% for performance letters of credit, based on the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio. The Company is subject to a commitment fee of 
0.20
% to 
0.30
%, based on the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio, on any unused portion of the Facility. The Credit Agreement restricts certain types of payments when the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect thereto, exceeds 
2.75
. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding on the Facility was 
6.63
% and 
7.07
% per annum, for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain financial covenants including a maximum Net Leverage Ratio of 
3.0
 and a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 
3.0
. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants including limitations on asset sales, investments, indebtedness and liens. The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
58.4
 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility and letters of credit outstanding under the Facility of approximately $
37.3
 million, including $
32.6
 million related to the Company's payment obligation under its insurance programs and approximately $
4.7
 million related to contract performance obligations.
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $
13.2
 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility and

letters of credit outstanding under the Facility of approximately $
34.4
 million, including $
27.1
 million related to the Company's payment obligation under its insurance programs and approximately $
7.3
 million related to contract performance obligations.
The Company had remaining deferred debt issuance costs related to the Facility totaling $
1.8
 million and $
2.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As permitted, debt issuance costs have been deferred and are presented as an asset within other assets, which is amortized as interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement.
Equipment Notes
The Company has entered into Master Equipment Loan and Security Agreements (the “Master Loan Agreements”) with multiple finance companies. The Master Loan Agreements may be used for the financing of equipment between the Company and the lenders pursuant to one or more equipment notes (“Equipment Note”). Each Equipment Note executed under the Master Loan Agreements constitutes a separate, distinct and independent financing of equipment and a contractual obligation of the Company, which may contain prepayment clauses.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
one
 Equipment Note outstanding under the Master Loan Agreements that is collateralized by equipment and vehicles owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
one
 other equipment note outstanding that is collateralized by a vehicle owned by the Company.

Revenue Recognition
Disaggregation of Revenue
A majority of the Company’s revenues are earned through contracts with customers that normally provide for payment upon completion of specified work or units of work as identified in the contract. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of these contracts, they are primarily structured as fixed-price contracts, under which the Company agrees to perform a defined scope of a project for a fixed amount, or unit-price contracts, under which the Company agrees to do the work at a fixed price per unit of work as specified in the contract. The Company also enters into time-and-equipment and time-and-materials contracts under which the Company is paid for labor and equipment at negotiated hourly billing rates and for other expenses, including materials, as incurred at rates agreed to in the contract. Finally, the Company sometimes enters into cost-plus contracts, where the Company is paid for costs plus a negotiated margin. On occasion, time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts require the Company to include a guarantee not-to-exceed a maximum price. 
Historically, fixed-price and unit-price contracts have had the highest potential margins; however, they have had a greater risk in terms of profitability because cost overruns may not be recoverable. Time-and-equipment, time-and-materials and cost-plus contracts have historically had less margin upside, but generally have had a lower risk of cost overruns. The Company also provides services under master service agreements (“MSAs”) and other variable-term service agreements. MSAs normally cover maintenance, upgrade and extension services, as well as new construction. Work performed under MSAs is typically billed on a unit-price, time-and-materials or time-and-equipment basis. MSAs are typically 
one
 to 
three years
 in duration; however, most of the Company’s contracts, including MSAs, may be terminated by the customer on short notice, typically 
30
 to 
90
 days, even if the Company is not in default under the contract. Under MSAs, customers generally agree to use the Company for certain services in a specified geographic region. Most MSAs include no obligation for the contract counterparty to assign specific volumes of work to the Company and do not require the counterparty to use the Company exclusively, although in some cases the MSA contract gives the Company a right of first refusal for certain work. Additional information related to the Company’s market types is provided in Note 17–Segment Information to the Financial Statements.

Remaining Performance Obligations
On December 31, 2024, the Company had $
2.34
 billion of remaining performance obligations. The Company’s remaining performance obligations include projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed-upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. The timing of when remaining performance obligations are recognized is evaluated quarterly and is largely driven by the estimated start date and duration of the underlying projects.
The following table summarizes the total amount of remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2024 that the Company expects to be realized, the amount of the remaining performance obligations that the Company reasonably estimates will be recognized within the next twelve months, and the amount estimated to be recognized after the next twelve months.

The Company estimates approximately

% or more

of the remaining performance obligations will be recognized within twenty-four months, including approximately 
80
% of the remaining performance obligations estimated to be recognized within twelve months, although the timing of the Company’s performance is not always under its control. The timing of when remaining performance obligations are recognized by the Company can vary considerably and is impacted by multiple variables including, but not limited to: changes in the estimated versus actual start time of a project; the availability of labor, equipment and materials; changes in project workflow; weather; project delays and accelerations; and the timing of final contract settlements. Additionally, the difference between the remaining performance obligations and backlog is due to the exclusion of a portion of the Company’s MSAs under certain contract types from the Company’s remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by the Company or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Additional information related to backlog is provided in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report.

The Company determined that it is more-likely-than-not that it will not realize certain deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards on certain Canadian subsidiaries and therefore recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets for those entities.
Earnings from the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested in Canada, therefore as of December 31, 2024, the Company had no undistributed earnings or withholding deferral associated with its Canadian subsidiaries. 
The Company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions. The Company’s 2020 through 2023 tax returns are subject to examination by U. S. federal authorities. The Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various state authorities for the years 2019 through 2023.
The Company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken on its various income tax returns. If recognized, the entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate that is reported in future periods. The decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits as of

December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the lapses in the applicable statutes of limitations. The total unrecognized tax benefits is expected to be reduced by less than $
0.2
 million within the next 12 months. Interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense in the Financial Statements.

Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
4.9
 million in outstanding purchase orders for certain construction equipment, with cash payments scheduled to occur in 2025.
Insurance and Claims Accruals
The Company carries insurance policies, which are subject to certain deductibles and limits, for workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability and other insurance coverage. The deductible per occurrence for each line of coverage is up to $
1.0
 million. The Company’s health benefit plans are subject to stop-loss limits of up to $
0.2
 million for qualified individuals. Losses up to the deductible and stop-loss amounts are accrued based upon the Company’s estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
The insurance and claims accruals are based on known facts, actuarial estimates and historical trends. While recorded accruals are based on the ultimate liability, which includes amounts in excess of the deductible, a corresponding receivable for amounts in excess of the deductible is included in total assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

90.6
 million, $
88.3
 million and $
77.1
 million, respectively.
Performance and Payment Bonds and Parent Guarantees
In certain circumstances, the Company is required to provide performance and payment bonds in connection with its future performance on certain contractual commitments. The Company has indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these bonds. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of approximately $
2.27
 billion in original face amount of bonds issued by the Company’s sureties were outstanding. The Company estimated the remaining cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $
662.6
 million as of December 31, 2024.
From time to time, the Company guarantees the obligations of wholly-owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease agreements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors’ licenses. Additionally, from time to time, the Company is required to post letters of credit to guarantee the obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which reduces the borrowing availability under the Facility.
73
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Indemnities
From time to time, pursuant to its service arrangements, the Company indemnifies its customers for claims related to the services it provides under those service arrangements. These indemnification obligations may subject the Company to indemnity claims, liabilities and related litigation. The Company is not aware of any material unrecorded liabilities for asserted claims in connection with these indemnification obligations.
Collective Bargaining Agreements
Most of the Company’s subsidiaries’ craft labor employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The agreements require the subsidiaries to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans. If a subsidiary withdraws from any of the multi-employer pension plans or if the plans were to otherwise become underfunded, the subsidiary could incur liabilities for additional contributions related to these plans. Although the Company has been informed that the status of some multi-employer pension plans to which its subsidiaries contribute have been classified as “critical”, the Company is not currently aware of any potential liabilities related to this issue. See Note 16 — Employee Benefit Plans to the Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s participation in multi-employer plans.
Litigation and Other Legal Matters
The Company is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The Company is routinely subject to other civil claims, litigation and arbitration, and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims and litigations include claims related to the Company’s current services and operations, the Company believes that it has strong defenses to these claims as well as insurance coverages that could contribute to any settlement or liability in the event claims are not resolved in our favor. These claims have not had a material impact on the Company to date, and the Company believes that the likelihood that a future material adverse outcome will result from these claims is remote. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future, the Company cannot be certain that an adverse outcome of one or more of these claims would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
15. 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company maintains 
two
 equity compensation plans under which stock-based compensation has been granted, the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated as of April 24, 2024) (the “LTIP”) and the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated as of May 1, 2014) (the “2007 LTIP” and, collectively with the LTIP, the “Long-Term Incentive Plans”). Upon the initial adoption of the LTIP in 2017, awards were no longer granted under the 2007 LTIP. The LTIP was approved by our shareholders and provides for grants of (a) incentive stock options qualified as such under U.S. federal income tax laws, (b) stock options that do not qualify as incentive stock options, (c) stock appreciation rights, (d) restricted stock awards, (e) restricted stock units, (f) performance awards, (g) phantom stock, (h) stock bonuses, (i) dividend equivalents, or (j) any combination of such awards. The LTIP permits the granting of up to 
1,500,000
 shares to directors, officers and other employees of the Company. Grants of awards to employees are approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and grants to independent members of the Board of Directors are approved by the Board of Directors. All awards are made with an exercise price or base price, as the case may be, that is not less than the full fair market value per share on the date of grant. No stock option or stock appreciation right may be exercised more than 
10
 years from the date of grant.
Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or stock grants are made available from authorized unissued shares of common stock or treasury stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stock Options
The Company has not awarded any stock options since 2013, and in 2023 the Company's final outstanding and exercisable options were exercised or expired. Stock options granted to the Company’s employees or directors were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options as of the date of grant. All stock options were fully expensed as of December 31, 2016.

Time-Vested Stock Awards
The company grants time-vested stock awards under the LTIP in the form of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or equity-settled phantom stock. The grant date fair value of the time-vested stock awards is equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Time-vested stock awards granted under the LTIP to eligible employees in 2024 vest ratably on an annual basis, over 
three years
. Time-vested stock awards granted under the LTIP to non-employee directors in 2024 vest over a 
one year
 period.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units based on the grant date fair value, which was the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The fair value is expensed over the service period, which is generally 
three years
 for time-vested stock awards granted to eligible employees and 
one year
 for non-employee directors.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, time-vested stock vesting activity settled in common stock had an intrinsic value, at the time of vesting, of $
6.8
 million, $
7.3
 million and $
7.0
 million, respectively.

Performance Awards
The Company grants performance awards under the LTIP. Under these awards, shares of the Company’s common stock may be earned based on the Company’s performance compared to defined metrics. The number of shares earned under a performance award may vary from 
zero
 to 
200
% of the target shares awarded, based upon the Company’s performance compared to certain financial and other metrics. The metrics used for the grant are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and may be either based on internal measures such as the Company’s financial performance compared to target or on a market-based metric such as the Company’s stock performance compared to a peer group. Performance awards cliff vest upon attainment of at least the minimum stated performance targets and minimum service requirements and are paid in the Company’s common stock.
For performance awards, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of internal metric-based performance awards is determined by the closing stock price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of market-based performance awards is computed using a Monte Carlo simulation. Performance awards granted in 2024 are expensed over the service period of approximately 
2.8
 years. The Company adjusts the stock-based compensation expense related to internal metric-based performance awards according to its determination of the shares expected to vest at each reporting date. Stock-based compensation expense related to market metric-based performance awards is expensed at their grant date fair value regardless of performance.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, performance award vesting activity settled in common stock had an intrinsic value, at the time of vesting, of $
3.2
 million, $
12.0
 million and $
15.7
 million, respectively.

Stock-based Compensation Expense
The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $
8.5
 million, $
8.4
 million and $
7.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $
12.6
 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plans. This included $
6.9
 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested time-vested stock awards expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately 
1.5
 years and $
5.7
 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance awards, expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately 
1.5
 years.
16. 
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors multiple defined contribution plans for eligible employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The plans include various features such as voluntary employee pre-tax and Roth-based contributions and matching contributions made by the Company. In addition, at the discretion of our Board of Directors, we may make additional profit sharing contributions to the plans. Company contributions under these defined contribution plans are based upon a percentage of income with limitations as defined by each plan. Total contributions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $
12.4
 million, $
15.9
 million, and $
15.7
 million, respectively.
The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees, who are represented by more than 
300
 local unions. The related collective-bargaining agreements between those organizations and the Company, which specify the rate at which the Company must contribute to the multi-employer defined pension plan, expire at different times between 2025 and 2027.
77
TABLE OF CONTENTS
The risks of participating in these multiemployer defined benefit pension plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:
1)
Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
2)
If a participating employer stops contributing to a plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
3)
If the Company chooses to stop participating in a multiemployer plan, it may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.
The amount of additional funds, if any, that the Company may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.
The following table summarizes plan information relating to the Company’s participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, including company contributions for the last three years, the status under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 (“PPA”) of the plans and whether the plans are subject to a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, or contribution surcharges. The most recent zone status is for the plan’s year-end indicated in the table. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan, as well as from publicly available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website. The PPA zone status for the plan year ended on December 31, 2024 has not been listed because Forms 5500 were not yet available. Among other factors, plans in the red “critical” zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow “endangered” zone are between 65 and 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. Also listed in the table below are the Company’s contributions to defined contribution plans. Information in the table has been presented separately for individually significant plans and in the aggregate for all other plans.

Segment Information
MYR Group is a holding company of specialty contractors serving electrical utility infrastructure and commercial construction markets in the United States and Canada. The Company has 
two
 reporting segments, each a separate operating segment, which are referred to as T&D and C&I. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. For the CODM’s primary allocation of resources and performance assessment, he receives revenue and income for operations, by segment and excluding general corporate expenses, over multiple time periods, along with a comparison to the corresponding budgeted and prior year totals. General corporate expenses include corporate facility and staffing costs, which includes safety costs, professional fees, IT expenses and certain management fees. The CODM also considers many other factors, such as contract terms, individual project performance, project location and other items when determining performance measurement and resource allocation.

 The T&D segment provides a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities which include design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services with a particular focus on construction, maintenance and repair. T&D services include the construction and maintenance of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage underground and overhead distribution systems, clean energy projects and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The T&D segment also provides emergency restoration services. T&D customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors.
Commercial and Industrial:
 The C&I segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, the installation of intelligent transportation systems, roadway lighting, signalization and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Typical C&I contracts cover electrical contracting services for airports, hospitals, data centers, hotels, stadiums, commercial and industrial facilities, clean energy projects, manufacturing plants, processing facilities, water/waste-water treatment facilities, mining facilities, and transportation control and management systems. The C&I segment generally provides electric construction and maintenance services as a subcontractor to general contractors in the C&I industry, but also contracts directly with facility owners.

Earnings Per Share
The Company computes earnings per share using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent would be anti-dilutive.
Net income and the weighted average number of common shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows:

Share Repurchase Program
On May 6, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new $
75.0
 million share repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program") which became effective on May 9, 2024. The Repurchase Program expired on November 8, 2024. The Company’s prior $
75.0
 million repurchase program that commenced on November 9, 2023 expired on May 8, 2024.
During 2024 the Company repurchased 
643,549
 shares of its common stock under multiple repurchase programs at a weighted-average price of $
116.54
 per share. During 2023 the Company repurchased 
25,042
 shares of its common stock under multiple repurchase programs at a weighted-average price of $
114.55
 per share. All of the shares repurchased were retired. The shares repurchased resulted in no change to authorized shares and an increase to unissued shares. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had exhausted substantially all of the funds available to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the Repurchase Program.
During 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 
36,397
 and 
76,150
 shares of stock, respectively, for approximately $
5.9
 million and $
7.9
 million, respectively, from its employees to satisfy tax obligations on shares vested under the LTIP. All of the shares repurchased were retired and returned to authorized but unissued stock.
Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management, together with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance related to the matters stated in the above paragraph as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, as of December 31, 2024, in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting is included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
82
TABLE OF CONTENTS
In addition, Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited and reported on the 2024 Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report is included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will detect or prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
