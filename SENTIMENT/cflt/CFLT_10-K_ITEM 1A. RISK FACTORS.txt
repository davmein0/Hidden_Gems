Overview

Confluent is pioneering the Data Streaming Platform category, setting data in motion to power the world’s real-time operations and analytics. We have established a new category of data infrastructure and built a comprehensive platform that enables organizations to stream, connect, process, and govern data in motion across their enterprise. The Data Streaming Platform is designed to serve as the intelligent connective tissue linking all of the applications, systems, and data layers within the company into a single central nervous system of real-time streams of data. This Data Streaming Platform is emerging as one of the most strategic parts of the next-generation technology stack, enabling modern companies to serve their customers, improve their offerings, outpace their competition, and win in the digital-first and AI-powered world.

Confluent is designed to act as the nexus of real-time data, from every source, allowing it to stream across the organization and enabling applications to harness it to power real-time customer experiences and data-driven business operations. The Data Streaming Platform delivers four key capabilities, Stream, Connect, Process, and Govern, that reinforce each other to create a comprehensive platform for data in motion. Streaming is the foundation, enabling data to continuously move in real-time to power modern business operations and applications. As companies implement more and more data streams they must connect a growing number of systems, applications, and data sources with the ultimate goal of building a complete network that spans the entire technology stack of the company. Once the network of connected systems and applications begins to grow, companies increasingly need to process data in real-time in order to transform, clean, and augment the data as it moves from one system to another. Finally, as the scale and scope of streaming increases, companies need to govern these data assets to ensure they are discoverable, secure, compliant, and trustworthy as they power a growing number of critical applications within the company. As the adoption of Confluent’s Data Streaming Platform grows within an organization, the network effects we generate create even more value to the organization as a whole. We believe that Confluent, over time, will become the central nervous system for modern digital enterprises, providing ubiquitous real-time connectivity and powering real-time applications across the enterprise.

We generate our revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions to our Data Streaming Platform, designed to span across all environments. Confluent Cloud is a fully-managed, cloud-native software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) offering available on all of the leading cloud providers. Confluent Platform is an enterprise-ready, self-managed software offering that can be deployed in our customers’ on-premise, private cloud, and public cloud environments. WarpStream is a Bring Your Own Cloud (“BYOC”) managed service offering where the raw data resides inside a customer’s own cloud environment. All of these offerings can be leveraged both individually in their respective environments and collectively as a single unified Data Streaming Platform.

Table of Contents

Confluent Cloud and WarpStream customers may purchase subscriptions either without a commitment contract on a month-to-month basis, which we refer to as pay-as-you-go, or under a usage-based commitment contract of at least one year in duration, in which customers commit to specified per-usage rates. Pay-as-you-go customers are billed, and revenue from them is recognized, based on usage. Customers with usage-based commitments are typically billed annually in advance or monthly in arrears, and we recognize revenue from such subscriptions based on usage by the customer. As a result, our revenue may fluctuate from period to period due to varying patterns of customer consumption. Confluent Platform customers receive access to our proprietary features and various tiers of customer support. Our subscriptions primarily have one-year terms and are generally billed annually in advance.

We are focused on the acquisition of new customers and expanding within our current customers. Our “consumption-oriented” go-to-market model benefits from our self-service motions driven by our cloud-native platform offerings, our widespread mindshare among developers through Apache Kafka®, Apache Flink®, and Apache Iceberg®, community downloads, and our enterprise sales force. We acquire new customers through seamless and frictionless self-service cloud adoption and free cloud trials, as well as community downloads. For example, after users get started with our free cloud trial, they can easily convert to become paying customers either online on a pay-as-you-go model or with a commitment contract. Once customers see the benefits of our platform for their initial use cases, we believe that they will expand into other use cases and lines of business, divisions, and geographies. Our deep technical expertise, coupled with our product capabilities and laser focus on customer outcomes, enable us to form strategic partnerships with our customers to guide and accelerate this journey. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our Data Streaming Platform to a customer increases as more use cases are adopted, more users and teams are onboarded, more applications and systems are connected, and more data is added. We had approximately 5,800 and 4,960 customers as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 17%. We have experienced significant growth, with revenue of $963.6 million and $777.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 24%.

Business and Macroeconomic Conditions

Our business and financial condition have been, and we believe will continue to be, impacted by adverse and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including high inflation, high interest rates, fluctuations or volatility in capital markets or foreign currency exchange rates, and geopolitical events around the world, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, negative impacts from these factors, including longer sales cycles, reduced IT budgets, slowdowns in customer consumption expansion and growth rates, including fewer new use cases adopted by customers, and generally increased scrutiny on IT spending from existing and potential customers. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in consumption from some of our larger enterprise customers, resulting in lower consumption expansion from time to time, primarily due to continued customer focus on near-term cloud cost controls and driving efficiencies and resulting impacts on expansion in new use cases. We typically experience more consumption volatility during periods of increased customer scrutiny on IT spending. We cannot be certain how long these uncertain macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical events, and IT spending and consumption patterns, and their resulting effects on our industry, our financial results, our business strategy, and customers, will persist. To navigate the current economic environment and its effects, we have taken actions to streamline our operating expenses by adjusting our cost structure and real estate footprint, including a workforce reduction in January 2023, while prudently investing in growth.

The full extent to which uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions and other factors and dynamics discussed above will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition remains uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the actual and potential impacts of general macroeconomic conditions and related factors on our business and operations.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

Developing Innovative, Market-Leading Offerings and Expanding Developer Mindshare

We are focused on delivering market-leading offerings. We believe it is critical for us to maintain our product leadership position and further increase the strength of our brand and reputation to drive revenue growth. We have made significant investments in our Data Streaming Platform to enable customers to stream, connect, process, and govern their data. For example, we significantly re-architected the technologies underlying data in motion, including open source Apache Kafka, with our purpose-built Kora engine, which powers Confluent Cloud to be a fully-managed cloud service. Additionally, our acquisition of immerok GmbH, an Apache Flink stream processing managed services company, enabled us to re-architect Flink as a cloud-native service on Confluent Cloud and release Confluent Platform for Apache Flink, while our Stream Governance suite establishes trust in real-time data movement and maintains stream quality, security, and regulatory compliance. We have also expanded to include support to materialize data streams as Apache Iceberg tables, which has rapidly become the open source standard for open table formats across numerous analytics compute engines. We expect our future growth to depend in large part on increased customer adoption and usage expansion of our Data Streaming Platform products. While customer adoption of our Data Streaming Platform products remains in early stages, we believe we have a robust opportunity to help our customers understand and realize the benefits of our complete Data Streaming Platform. We intend to continue to invest efficiently in our engineering capabilities, including through acquisitions, and marketing activities to maintain our strong position within the developer community. Our results of operations may fluctuate as we make these investments to drive increased customer adoption and usage.

Increasing Adoption of Confluent Cloud

We believe our cloud-native Confluent Cloud offering continues to represent an important growth opportunity for our business. Organizations are increasingly looking for a fully-managed offering to seamlessly leverage data in motion across a variety of environments. In some cases, customers that have been self-managing deployments through Confluent Platform subsequently have become Confluent Cloud customers. We offer users a free cloud trial and a pay-as-you-go arrangement to encourage adoption and expand via new use cases to increase usage over time. We will continue to leverage our cloud-native differentiation to drive our growth. We expect Confluent Cloud’s contribution to our revenue to continue to increase over time. Our Confluent Cloud revenue represented 51% and 45% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As we recognize revenue from Confluent Cloud based on usage, our revenue and results of operations have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from period to period due to the usage-based nature of Confluent Cloud, our shift to a consumption-oriented sales model for Confluent Cloud, and varying patterns of customer consumption and adoption trends, including due to impacts from macroeconomic uncertainty and related effects on customer IT spending, as described above.

Table of Contents

Growing Our Customer Base

We are intensely focused on continuing to grow our customer base. We have invested and will continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, including pipeline generation and execution, and developer community outreach, which are critical to driving customer acquisition. We historically focused on large enterprise customers with significant expansion opportunities and built a go-to-market motion around this approach. As we grew our cloud offering and increasingly prioritized consumption over commitments, including by creating more self-serve opportunities and completing our shift to a consumption-oriented sales model for Confluent Cloud, we have broadened our reach of customers and are able to attract a greater array of customers, including those in the earlier stages of data streaming adoption. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on and has historically been impacted by a number of factors, including our success in recruiting and scaling our sales and marketing organization, our ability to accelerate ramp time of our sales force, expansion and refinement of our go-to-market strategies to reach additional customer opportunities and to focus on consumption over commitments, our ability to enhance our brand and educate potential customers about the benefits and reduced total cost of ownership of our offerings compared to alternatives for data in motion, such as Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Iceberg, our ability to effectively and competitively price our offerings, our ability to expand features and functionalities of our offerings, our ability to grow and harness our partner ecosystem, macroeconomic uncertainty and challenges, and competitive dynamics in our target markets. We had approximately 5,800 and 4,960 customers as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, spanning organizations of all sizes and industries. Our customer count treats affiliated entities with the same parent organization as a single customer and includes pay-as-you-go customers, and may fluctuate due to acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity.

Retaining and Expanding Revenue from Existing Customers

Our business model and future growth are driven by customer renewals and increasing existing customer consumption and subscriptions over time, referred to as land-and-expand. Our ability to retain and expand revenue from existing customers, including through increased consumption of our offerings and contractual commitments and renewals, will depend on and has historically been impacted by a number of factors, including market acceptance of our offerings compared to data-in-motion alternatives, such as Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Iceberg pricing of our offerings, customer satisfaction, expansion of features and functionalities of our offerings, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and overall changes in our customers’ spending levels. In particular, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in consumption from some of our larger enterprise customers, resulting in lower consumption expansion from time to time, primarily due to continued customer focus on near-term cloud cost controls and driving efficiencies and resulting impacts on expansion in new use cases. Despite the continuing uncertain economic backdrop and consumption volatility, we believe we have significant opportunities to partner with our customers to help them realize increased value in Confluent in an efficient and sustainable manner, including through expansion of new use cases to drive their strategic goals. While these dynamics are expected to continue to result in reduced or fluctuating consumption expansion over the near term, we believe they can lead to more durable consumption expansion over time.

Investing in Growth and Scaling our Business

We believe our market opportunity is significant, and we are focused on continuing to make disciplined investments in our long-term revenue and profitability potential. We believe it is critical to scale across all organizational functions in order to capture this opportunity. Investments we make in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations will occur in advance of experiencing the benefits from such investments, and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating resources. Our revenue growth potential is dependent on the effectiveness of such investments, which include the development of new product features and enhancements, and the continued refinement of our go-to-market strategies, including for our Data Streaming Platform products and our shift to a consumption-oriented sales model for Confluent Cloud. To navigate more challenging macroeconomic conditions, we intend to take a disciplined approach in investing to grow our business to take advantage of our expansive market opportunity while also optimizing for improvements in profitability, margins, and cash flow, including by streamlining our operating expenses.

Key Business Metrics

We monitor the key business metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. The calculation of the key metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors.

Subscription Revenue

We believe subscription revenue reflects the performance of our business because it captures both delivery of contractual commitments from Confluent Platform and consumption from Confluent Cloud and WarpStream. We discuss subscription revenue under “Components of Results of Operations.”

Customers with $100,000 or Greater in Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”)

We define ARR as (1) with respect to Confluent Platform customers, the amount of revenue to which our customers are contractually committed over the following 12 months assuming no increases or reductions in their subscriptions, and (2) with respect to Confluent Cloud and WarpStream customers, the amount of revenue that we expect to recognize from such customers over the following 12 months, calculated by annualizing actual consumption of Confluent Cloud and WarpStream in the last three months of the applicable period, assuming no increases or reductions in usage rate. Services arrangements are excluded from the calculation of ARR. Large customer relationships lead to scale and operating leverage in our business model. Compared with smaller customers, large customers present a greater opportunity for us because they have larger budgets, greater potential for migrating more applications over time, and a wider range of potential use cases for data in motion. As a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract large enterprises to our offerings, we count the number of customers that contributed $100,000 or greater in ARR as of period end. Our customer count may also fluctuate due to acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. We had 1,381 and 1,229 customers with $100,000 or greater in ARR as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate (“NRR”)

We calculate our dollar-based NRR as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period end, or Prior Period Value. We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Value, and divide the Current Period Value by the Prior Period Value to arrive at our dollar-based NRR. The dollar-based NRR includes the effect, on a dollar-weighted value basis, of our Confluent Platform subscriptions that expand, renew, contract, or attrit. The dollar-based NRR also includes the effect of annualizing actual consumption of Confluent Cloud and WarpStream in the last three months of the applicable period, but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. Our dollar-based NRR is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. We believe that our dollar-based NRR provides useful information about the evolution of our existing customers and our future growth prospects. Our dollar-based NRR was 117% as of December 31, 2024, demonstrating our ability to expand within existing customers. Over the near term, we expect our dollar-based NRR to be tempered as a result of our shift to a consumption-oriented sales model for Confluent Cloud. Our dollar-based NRR as of December 31, 2024 was also tempered by, and over the near term is expected to continue to be tempered by, consumption volatility, resulting in reduced consumption expansion from certain customers, as described above under “—Key Factors Affecting Our Performance—Retaining and Expanding Revenue from Existing Customers.” Our methodology for calculating ARR may result in increased volatility in NRR as our customers’ consumption trends have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations across quarters. Refer to the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We expect fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline.”

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

We derive revenue primarily from subscriptions and, to a lesser extent, services.

Subscription Revenue
. Our subscription revenue consists of subscriptions to our Data Streaming Platform for customers to stream, connect, process, and govern all of their data. Our subscription offerings are designed to span across all environments: Confluent Cloud, our fully-managed cloud-native offering, Confluent Platform, our self-managed software offering, and WarpStream, a BYOC managed service offering. The vast majority of our revenue from Confluent Cloud for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was based on usage-based commitments and is recognized on a usage basis, as usage represents a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the subscription transferred as of a particular date relative to the total value to be delivered over the term of the contract. Revenue from Confluent Platform includes revenue from term-based licenses and post-contract customer support, maintenance, and upgrades, referred to together as PCS. We recognize a portion of the revenue from our term-based license subscriptions at a point in time, upon delivery and transfer of control of the underlying license to the customer, which is typically the effective start date. Revenue from PCS, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue from our term-based license subscriptions, is recognized ratably over the contract term. Our subscriptions primarily have terms of one to three years, and are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable. We also provide pay-as-you-go arrangements, which consist of month-to-month SaaS contracts. Pay-as-you-go and WarpStream arrangements have historically represented an immaterial portion of our subscription revenue.

Services Revenue
. Services revenue consists of revenue from professional services and education services, which are generally sold on a time-and-materials basis. Revenue for professional services and education services is recognized as these services are delivered.

We expect our total revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of new subscriptions, the rate of customer renewals and expansions, fluctuations in customer consumption of and adoption trends for our usage-based offering, delivery of professional services, ramp time and productivity of our sales force, the impact of significant transactions, and seasonality.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of Subscription Revenue
. Cost of subscription revenue primarily includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with customer support and maintenance, third-party cloud infrastructure costs, amortization of internal-use software and acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead costs for information technology, facilities, business systems, and recruiting. We expect our cost of subscription revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases.

Cost of Services Revenue
. Cost of services revenue primarily includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with our professional services and education services, costs of third-party consultants and partners who supplement our services delivery team, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost of services revenue to fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing and delivery of professional services and education services.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross Profit
. Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue.

Gross Margin
. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our subscriptions and services, changes in our revenue mix, including the mix of revenue between our Confluent Cloud, Confluent Platform, WarpStream, and service offerings, timing and amount of usage of third-party cloud infrastructure resources, infrastructure optimization, and timing and extent of our investments in growth and scaling our business. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.

Operating Expenses

Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and restructuring and other related charges. Personnel-related costs are generally the most significant component of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for information technology, facilities, business systems, and recruiting.

Research and Development
. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, net of capitalized amounts, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing our offering, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our research and development organization, contractor and professional services fees, and allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows and we continue to invest in our offering.

Sales and Marketing
. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions and the associated payroll taxes, conferences, costs related to marketing programs, travel-related costs, and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, and brand-building and developer-community activities. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars over time and continue to be our largest operating expense for the foreseeable future as we invest in our sales and marketing efforts. We also expect a greater increase in our sales and marketing expenses as a result of shifting our sales compensation plan to be oriented toward consumption for Confluent Cloud, which results in higher upfront expense recognition from consumption-oriented sales commissions.

General and Administrative
. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for administrative functions including finance, human resources, and legal, professional fees, software and subscription services dedicated for use by our general and administrative functions, and allocated overhead. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars over time as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.

Restructuring and Other Related Charges
. Restructuring and other related charges consist of personnel-related costs, including employee transition and severance payments, employee benefits, and related facilitation costs, as well as lease abandonment charges.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on marketable securities, amortization of debt issuance costs, gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, and realized gains and losses on marketable securities.

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of income taxes in certain foreign and U.S. federal and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Subscription revenue increased by $193.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily from sales to existing customers and the remaining increase was attributable to sales to new customers. Sales to new customers represent the revenue recognized from customers acquired in the 12 months prior to each discrete quarter end within the year ended December 31, 2024. A further indication of our ability to expand from existing customers is through our dollar-based net retention rate, which was 117% as of December 31, 2024. Confluent Cloud and Confluent Platform contributed 53% and 47% of our subscription revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to 48%  and 52% during the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively.

Services revenue decreased by $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in delivery of professional services.

Cost of subscription revenue increased by $32.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $18.4 million in third-party cloud infrastructure costs, an increase of $6.3 million in amortization of internal-use software and an increase of $3.5 million in software license costs.

Cost of services revenue decreased by $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs and allocated overhead costs driven by decreased headcount
.

Our subscription gross margin increased primarily due to efficiencies in personnel-related costs offset by a change in our revenue mix toward Confluent Cloud which has a lower gross margin. Our services gross margin decreased primarily due to personnel-related costs decreasing at a lower rate than services revenue.

 tax expense of $26.4 million was related to an intra-group transfer of acquired intellectual property. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

The most significant component of our tax expense is income taxes in various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate to the extent the mix of earnings fluctuates between jurisdictions with different tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

To date, we have financed operations primarily through proceeds received from issuances of equity and debt securities and payments received from our customers. In December 2021, we issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs, were $1,080.5 million.

As of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1,910.6 million. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist of bank deposits, money market funds, 
corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, and time deposits
.

We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating and capital needs, including our purchase obligations primarily related to our non-cancelable agreements for third-party cloud infrastructure, and operating lease commitments, primarily related to our office space. As of December 31, 2024, our purchase obligations were $610.6 million, of which $193.4 million is expected to be paid within 12 months and the remainder thereafter. As of December 31, 2024, our operating lease payment obligations were $18.7 million, of which $9.4 million is expected to be paid within 12 months and the remainder thereafter. See Note 9, 
Commitments and Contingencies
, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

We have generated significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,989.2 million. We may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operations, and the continuing market acceptance of our subscriptions and services. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

We generally invoice our customers annually in advance for our term-based licenses and typically annually in advance or monthly in arrears for our SaaS offering. Our largest source of operating cash is payments received from our customers. We have in the past and expect in the future to experience seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically being our strongest quarter for sales to customers as a result of large enterprise buying patterns. Accordingly, the operating cash flow benefit from increased collections from our customers generally occurs in the subsequent quarter after billing. We expect seasonality, timing of billings, and collections from our customers to have a material impact on our cash flow from operating activities from period to period. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure costs, sales and marketing expenses, and overhead expenses.

Cash provided by operating activities of $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily consisted of our net loss of $345.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 
$445.7 million
, and net cash outflows of 
$67.2 million 
from changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of a business combination. Our non-cash charges included $395.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized, $54.3 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, and $22.1 million of depreciation and amortization of property equipment and acquired intangible assets, partially offset by $37.8 million of net accretion of discounts on marketable securities. The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of a business combination, were an $86.6 million increase in accounts receivables due to timing of billings and collections as well as overall growth of our sales, a $53.2 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs due to our sales, and a $10.1 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to lease payments, partially offset by a $56.2 million increase in deferred revenue corresponding with our increased sales and a $25.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to timing of accruals and payments.

The main drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of business combinations, were a $61.4 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs due to our increased sales, a $53.6 million increase in accounts receivable due to overall growth of our sales, a $14.5 million decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments, and a $10.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets related to timing of payments made in advance for future services, partially offset by a $61.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to $17.4 million in accrued compensation expense related to acquisition-related holdback agreements and the timing of accruals and payments and a $30.2 million increase in deferred revenue corresponding with our increased sales.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities of $75.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of $1,539.7 million, cash paid for a business combination, net of cash acquired of $115.5 million, and capitalized internal-use software development costs of $21.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1,606.5 million.

Cash used in investing activities of $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of $1,586.7 million, cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired of $55.8 million, and capitalized internal-use software development costs of $17.8 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $1,578.3 million.

.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.

We believe that the accounting policy and estimate described below involves a greater degree of judgment and complexity and therefore is the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents

Revenue Recognition

See Note 2, 
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our significant accounting policies over revenue recognition.

Our contracts with customers often contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. We consider our determination of SSP to be a critical accounting estimate. SSP is established based on multiple factors, including prices at which we separately sell standalone subscriptions and services. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, such as when license and PCS are not sold on a standalone basis, we establish the SSP by using information such as the historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions, market conditions, and our pricing practices, which can require significant judgment and are subject to change based on continuous reevaluation. There may be more than one SSP for individual subscriptions and services due to the stratification of subscription support tiers and services. We also consider if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, we allocate revenue to the material right as a performance obligation.

Ite
m 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2024, we had $1,910.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in a variety of securities including money market funds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, and time deposits. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. The effect of a hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024.

In December 2021, we issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The fair value of the 2027 Notes are subject to market risk and other factors due to the conversion feature. The fair value of the 2027 Notes will generally increase as our Class A common stock price increases, and will generally decrease as our Class A common stock price declines. The market value changes affect the fair value of the 2027 Notes, but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, we carry the 2027 Notes at face value less unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our reporting currency and the functional currency of our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The substantial majority of our sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. A portion of our operating expenses and balance sheet items are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

88

Table of Contents

To reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we established a hedging program in December 2022. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Our hedging program reduces but does not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements.

The effect of a hypothetical 10% relative change in foreign exchange rates, after considering our hedging program, would not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for the periods presented. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Confluent, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Confluent, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit) and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

91

Table of Contents

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Development of Standalone Selling Price and Allocation of the Transaction Price to Performance Obligations

As described in Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, subscription revenue was $922 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company’s contracts with customers often contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, management allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. SSP is established based on multiple factors, including prices at which the Company separately sells standalone subscriptions and services. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, such as when license and post contract support are not sold on a standalone basis, management establishes the SSP by using information such as the historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions, market conditions, and the Company’s pricing practices, which can require significant judgment and are subject to change based on continuous reevaluation. There may be more than one SSP for individual subscriptions and services due to the stratification of subscription support tiers and services. Management also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, allocates revenue to the material right as a performance obligation.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the development of SSP and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimates of SSP for certain of the Company’s performance obligations and allocating the transaction price and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to prices at which the Company separately sells standalone subscriptions and services, and in cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions and the Company’s pricing practices.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over developing estimates of SSP and allocating the transaction price to the individual performance obligations. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the estimates of SSP; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the overall methodology used by management to develop the estimates; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to prices at which the Company separately sells standalone subscriptions and services, and in cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions and the Company’s pricing practices; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the methodology; and (v) testing the accuracy of management’s calculations of estimated selling prices and allocation of transaction prices. Evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to prices at which the Company separately sells standalone subscription and services, and in the cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions and the Company’s pricing practices involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the historical selling prices of standalone subscription and services and similar transactions; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Organization and Description of Business

Description of Business

Confluent, Inc. (“Confluent” or the “Company”) provides a Data Streaming Platform that enables customers to connect their applications, systems, and data layers and can be deployed as a fully-managed cloud-native software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) offering, Confluent Cloud, as a self-managed software offering, Confluent Platform, or as a Bring Your Own Cloud (“BYOC”) managed service offering where the raw data resides inside a customer’s own cloud environment, WarpStream. Confluent also offers professional services and education services. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in September 2014 and is headquartered in California with various other global office locations.

2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the prior year consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year consolidated financial statements. These reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net loss, stockholders’ equity, or cash flows as previously reported.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation included in customer contracts, deferred contract acquisition costs and their period of benefit, stock-based compensation expense, 
the fair value of acquired intangible assets, 
capitalization of internal-use software, 
estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, 
the incremental borrowing rate used to measure operating lease liabilities, and accounting for income taxes.

The Company bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects, including the impact of global macroeconomic conditions, cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Functional Currency

The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement and settlements are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Net foreign exchange losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, and $
2.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

101

Table of Contents

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, commercial paper, and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less, to be cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities

The Company’s marketable securities consist of corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, and time deposits. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified and accounted for its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities. The Company may sell these securities at any time for use in its current operations or for other purposes, even prior to maturity. As a result, the Company classifies its marketable securities within current assets.

Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value each reporting period, and are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and such amortization and accretion are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets until realized.

For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its entire amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost is due to credit or non-credit related factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. Credit related unrealized losses are recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding charge in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-credit related unrealized losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:
•
Level 1 Inputs: Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices in less active markets or model-derived valuations that are observable either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Table of Contents

The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, derivative instruments, and convertible senior notes. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date. See Note 4 for further details regarding the fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments and convertible senior notes.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses

Accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets consists of trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. Trade accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount and consist of amounts currently due from customers. Unbilled receivables represent revenue recognized in excess of invoiced amounts for the Company’s unconditional right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to the customer, such that only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. The unbilled receivables balance was $
130.7
 million and $
64.2
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for expected credits losses represents the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses against the existing accounts receivable, inclusive of unbilled receivables, based on certain factors including the age of the receivable balance, past collection experience with the customer, historical write-off experience, credit quality of the customer, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses when identified and the Company no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable. The Company’s allowance for expected credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Additions to and write-offs against the allowance for expected credit losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with certain financial institutions to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows and earnings. Derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. The Company records changes in the fair value of these derivatives as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassifies the related gains or losses into cost of revenue or operating expense in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis and does not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments for effectiveness testing purposes. The Company classifies cash flows related to its cash flow hedges as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows.

Derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in the fair value of assets or liabilities or hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The Company records changes in the fair value of these derivatives in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company classifies cash flows related to these derivatives as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Company has master netting agreements with each of its counterparties, which permit net settlement of multiple, separate derivative contracts with a single payment. The Company does not have collateral requirements with any of its counterparties. Although the Company is allowed to present the fair value of derivative instruments on a net basis according to master netting arrangements, the Company has elected to present its derivative instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’
s derivative instruments generally have maturities of 
18 months
 or less.
 The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Concentration of Risks

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and derivative instruments. The primary focus of the Company’s investment strategy is to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. The Company invests its excess cash in highly rated money market funds and in marketable securities. The Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses on customers’ accounts when deemed necessary. The Company mitigates its counterparty credit risk related to derivative instruments by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings.

No customer represented 
10
% or greater of total revenue for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
. No customer represented 
10
% or greater of gross accounts receivable as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023

Deferred Contract Acquisition Costs

The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if such costs are recoverable. Such costs primarily consist of sales commissions earned by the Company’s sales force and the associated payroll taxes. Sales commissions for new revenue contracts, including incremental sales to existing customers, are deferred and then amortized over an estimated period of benefit, which the Company has determined to be one to five years. To determine the period of benefit, the Company has considered its technology development cycle, the cadence of software releases, the nature of its customer contracts, the duration of customer relationships, and the expected renewal period. Sales commissions for renewal contracts (which are not considered commensurate with sales commissions for new revenue contracts and incremental sales to existing customers) are deferred and then amortized over the renewal contract term.

Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred costs. The Company did 
no
t recognize any impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs during the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
.

Capitalized Software Costs

Software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and amortized over the estimated life of the product. Technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Costs to develop software that is marketed externally have 
no
t been capitalized as the current software development process is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility and were not material for the periods presented. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements are capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post-implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the capitalized software asset, which is generally 
three
 to 
five years
. The amortization of internal-use software costs is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates the useful life of these assets on a periodic basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The Company did 
no
t recognize any impairment of capitalized internal-use software costs during the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
.

Table of Contents

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
The estimated lives of the Company’s assets are as follows:

Useful Lives

Computers, equipment, and software

3
 years

Furniture and fixtures

5
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of the remaining lease term or useful life

The Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its property and equipment. If the estimated useful life assumption for any asset is changed due to new information, the remaining unamortized balance would be depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life on a prospective basis.

Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated financial statements and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. There were 
no
 material gains or losses incurred as a result of retirement or sale during the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
.

Leases

Leases arise from contractual obligations that convey the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company determines if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. All of the Company’s leases are operating leases and are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases. The Company has elected an accounting policy to not recognize short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, on the consolidated balance sheets.

Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate used is estimated based on what the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis in the currency in which the arrangement is denominated over a similar term as the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments based on an index or rate, if any, and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. Variable lease payments not based on a rate or index are expensed as incurred.

Business Combinations

When the Company acquires a business, the purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of estimates including, but not limited to, the selection of valuation methodologies, time and resources required to recreate the assets a
cquired, and selection of comparable companies. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and acquired intangible assets, for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. 
There were 
no
 impairment charges related to long-lived assets during the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill. There were 
no
 goodwill impairment charges during 
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
.

Convertible Senior Notes

The Company accounts for its convertible senior notes wholly as debt. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Company’s convertible senior notes are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the outstanding convertible senior notes. These costs are amortized as interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the convertible senior notes and is included within other income (expense)
, net on the consolidated statements of operations.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue, which is a contract liability, primarily consists of customer billings or payments received in advance of revenue being recognized from the Company’s subscription and services contracts. The Company generally invoices customers annually in advance for its term-based licenses and typically annually in advance or monthly in arrears for its SaaS offering. Typical payment terms range from net 30 to net 60 days of the invoice date. Deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as deferred revenue within current liabilities and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, non-current. The Company records deferred revenue upon the right to invoice or when payments have been received for subscriptions or services not delivered. Deferred revenue does not necessarily represent the total contract value of the related agreements.
Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions and services. Subscription revenue consists of subscriptions to Confluent Cloud, a fully-managed SaaS offering that is entirely cloud-native, Confluent Platform, a self-managed offering for on-premise deployments, and WarpStream, a BYOC managed streaming service where the raw data resides inside a customer’s own cloud environment. Confluent Cloud and WarpStream customers may purchase subscriptions either without a commitment contract on a month-to-month basis, which the Company refers to as pay-as-you-go, or under a usage-based commitment contract of at least one year in duration, in which customers commit to specified per-usage rates. Revenue from the Company’s pay-as-you-go and WarpStream arrangements were immaterial portions of subscription revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The Company primarily enters into subscription contracts with one-year terms, and subscription contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable, although customers can terminate for breach if the Company materially fails to perform. Services revenue consists of revenue from professional services and education services. The Company generates sales of its subscriptions and services through its sales teams, self-service channel, and partner ecosystem, including the major cloud provider marketplaces.

106

Table of Contents

The consolidated financial statements reflect the Company’s accounting for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customers obtain control of promised subscriptions or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those subscriptions or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the following steps are performed:

(i)         identification of the contract with a customer

The Company generally contracts with customers through order forms, which are governed by master sales agreements, and through cloud provider marketplaces. The Company determines that it has a contract with a customer when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the subscriptions or services to be transferred and the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. The Company applies judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit, financial, or other information pertaining to the customer.

When a contract is entered into, the Company evaluates whether the contract is part of a larger arrangement and should be accounted for with other contracts and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation.

(ii)         identification of the performance obligations in the contract

Performance obligations are identified based on the subscriptions and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both (1) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the subscriptions or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and (2) distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the subscriptions and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Where applicable, the Company also identifies material rights as performance obligations. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised subscriptions or services, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised subscriptions or services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, or if performance obligations follow the same pattern of recognition, the promised subscriptions or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The Company has concluded that its contracts with customers do not contain warranties that give rise to a separate performance obligation.

(iii)         measurement of the transaction price

The transaction price is the total amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the subscriptions and services in a contract. The transaction price in a usage-based SaaS contract is typically equal to the commitment in the contract, less any discounts provided. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. The vast majority of Company’s contracts do not contain a material significant financing component.

107

Table of Contents

(iv)         allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations;

If a contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price using a relative SSP allocation based on the SSPs of each performance obligation. Determining the relative SSP for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations is a critical accounting estimate. The Company establishes each SSP based on multiple factors, including prices at which the Company separately sells standalone subscriptions and services. In cases where directly observable standalone sales are not available, such as when license and PCS are not sold on a standalone basis, the Company establishes SSP by using information such as historical selling price of performance obligations in similar transactions, market conditions, and the Company’s pricing practices, which can require significant judgment and are subject to change based on continuous reevaluation. There may be more than one SSP for individual subscriptions and services due to the stratification of subscription support tiers and services. The Company also considers if there are any additional material rights inherent in a contract, and if so, it allocates revenue to the material right as a performance obligation.

(v)         recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies each performance obligation;

The Company recognizes revenue at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those subscriptions or services. The Company records its revenue net of any withholding, value added or sales tax, as well as any discounts or marketing development funds.

Subscription Revenue

The Company’s subscription revenue includes revenue from Confluent Cloud and WarpStream for its usage-based commitment contracts and pay-as-you-go arrangements, which is recognized on a usage basis, as usage represents a direct measurement of the value to the customer of the subscription transferred as of a particular date relative to the total value to be delivered over the term of the contract.

The Company’s subscription revenue also includes revenue from Confluent Platform for term-based licenses sold in conjunction with post-contract customer support, maintenance, and upgrades, referred to together as PCS. The license provides the right to use licensed proprietary software features, which represents significant standalone functionality and is therefore deemed a distinct performance obligation. License revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon delivery and transfer of control of the underlying license to the customer, which is typically the effective start date. Revenue from PCS is based on its continuous pattern of transfer to the customer and therefore is recognized ratably over the contract term.

Services Revenue

The Company’s services revenue includes revenue from professional services and education services, which are generally sold on a time-and-materials basis. The Company recognizes the associated revenue as services are delivered.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of Subscription Revenue

Cost of subscription revenue primarily includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with customer support and maintenance, third-party cloud infrastructure costs, amortization of internal-use software and acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead.

Cost of Services Revenue

Cost of services revenue primarily includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, for employees associated with professional services and education services, costs of third-party consultants and partners who supplement our services delivery team
, and allocated overhead.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in developing the Company’s offering, software and subscription services dedicated for use by the Company’s research and development organization, contractor and professional services fees, and allocated overhead.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred or when the advertising first takes place, based on the nature of the advertising, and are recorded in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expense was $
31.5
 million, $
27.7
 million, and $
28.7
 million, for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense in connection with all stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and non-employees and stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to employees, based on the fair value of the awards granted. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and ESPP rights on the dates of grant. Calculating the fair value of stock options and ESPP rights using the Black-Scholes model requires certain highly subjective inputs and assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the stock option or ESPP right, and the expected volatility of the price of the Company’s common stock. The fair value of each RSU is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

For stock-based awards that vest based only on continuous service, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of 
two
 to 
four years
. For awards with both a service-based and a performance-based vesting condition, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, from the time it is probable that the vesting condition will be met through the time the service-based vesting condition has been achieved. The Company has also granted certain options containing a provision whereby vesting is accelerated upon a change in control; stock-based compensation expense for such options is recognized on a straight-line basis over a vesting period of generally four years, as a change in control is considered to be outside of the Company’s control and is not considered probable until it occurs. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax law in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.

A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish such allowances is assessed periodically by considering matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and results of recent operations.

The Company evaluates and accounts for the benefits of uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition, step one, occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement, step two, determines the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

Net Loss Per Share

The Company computes basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders using the two-class method required for companies with participating securities. The Company considers unvested common stock to be participating securities, as the holders of such securities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event that a dividend is paid on common stock.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding unvested common stock that is subject to repurchase and unvested restricted common stock. Basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, as the inclusion of all potentially dilutive shares was anti-dilutive due to the net loss reported for each period.

The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to each class of common stock and the resulting basic and diluted net loss per share are, therefore, the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis.

Segment and Geographic Information

The Company operates its business as 
one
 operating and reportable segment as the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM primarily uses consolidated net loss as the measure of profit or loss to facilitate analysis of the Company’s financial trends, and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Consolidated expense information included on the consolidated statements of operations and total stock-based compensation expense included in Note 11 Stockholders’ Equity are regularly provided to the CODM.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, substantially all of the Company’s long-lived assets, including property and equipment, net, and operating right-of-use assets were located in the United States. See Note 10 for revenue disaggregated by geographic markets.

8. Convertible Senior Notes

In December 2021, the Company issued $
1.1
 billion aggregate principal amount of 
0
% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), including the exercise in full of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase up to an additional $
100.0
 million principal amount of the 2027 Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers 
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2027 Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on January 15, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2027 Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the 2027 Notes will not accrete. Special interest, if any, is payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2022 (if and to the extent that special interest is then payable on the 2027 Notes). No special interest has been paid in connection with the 2027 Notes to date. 
The total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting initial purchasers’ discounts and debt issuance costs, were $
1,080.5
 million.

The initial conversion rate is 
9.9936
 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
100.06
 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock), subject to adjustment as set forth in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes (the “Indenture”). The 2027 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 15, 2026, only under the following conditions:

118

Table of Contents

(1)
during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2022 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2027 Notes on each applicable trading day;
(2)
during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $
1,000
 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock and the conversion rate for the 2027 Notes on each such trading day;
(3)
if the Company calls such 2027 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2027 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or
(4)
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the Indenture.

On or after October 15, 2026, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2027 Notes at any time, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2027 Notes or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption in respect of the 2027 Notes, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2027 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2027 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its 2027 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the 2027 Notes to convert have not been met. The 2027 Notes were therefore not convertible and were classified as long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.

The Company may not redeem the 2027 Notes prior to January 20, 2025. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes (subject to the certain limitations described in the Indenture), at its option, on or after January 20, 2025, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price for the 2027 Notes then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company redeems less than all of the outstanding 2027 Notes, at least $
100.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of, and after giving effect to, delivery of the relevant notice of redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2027 Notes.

The Company incurred $
19.5
 million of debt issuance costs related to the 2027 Notes. These costs are amortized to interest expense included within other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations over the contractual term of the 2027 Notes at an effective interest rate of 
0.35
%. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $
3.8
 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Capped Calls

In connection with the pricing of the 2027 Notes and the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional 2027 Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the 2027 Notes or their respective affiliates and other financial institutions (the “Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $
100.06
 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2027 Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $
138.02
 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls associated with the 2027 Notes cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
11.0
 million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s Class A common stock upon any conversion of the 2027 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2027 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions and not part of the terms of the 2027 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $
91.0
 million incurred to purchase the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and will not be remeasured.

9. Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

The Company has entered into non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for the rent of office space expiring at various dates through 2029. Certain lease agreements contain an option for the Company to renew the lease for a term of up to 
five years
 or 
an option to terminate the lease early within three years of lease termination
. The Company considers these options in determining the lease term and minimum lease payments on a lease-by-lease basis. None of the Company’s lease agreements contain any material non-lease components, material residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.

In 2019, the Company was issued a letter of credit of $
8.2
 million for its office space in Mountain View, California. The letter of credit was reduced to $
6.5
 million during 
the year ended December 31, 2024. No draws have been made under the letter of credit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

In addition, the Company subleased certain floors of its unoccupied office space that expired at various dates in 2022. Sublease income was recorded as a reduction of lease expense and was not material for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was 
no
 sublease income during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, lease expense, net of sublease income of $
4.9
 million, $
20.9
 million, and $
10.1
 million is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, respectively. Lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $
15.7
 million of lease abandonment charges related to the cease use of certain leased office space recorded within restructuring and other related charges in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 12 for further information on the Company’s restructuring actions. The Company did not have any material variable lease costs or short-term lease costs for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. C
ash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $
11.1
 million, $
8.7
 million, and $
10.7
 million for 
the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the Company’s operating leases was 
2.0
 and 
2.8
 years, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the present value of the operating lease liabilities was 
4.7
% and 
4.3
%, respectively.

1. Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

In connection with its IPO, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which authorized the issuance of 
10,000,000
 shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $
0.00001
 per share with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors.

Common Stock

The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. In connection with its IPO, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of 
1,000,000,000
 shares of Class A common stock and 
500,000,000
 shares of Class B common stock. The shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, converting, and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 
ten
 votes. Class A and Class B common stock have a par value of $
0.00001
 per share and are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise noted. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive any dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors.
Each share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. Any holder’s shares of Class B common stock will convert automatically to Class A common stock, on a one-to-one basis, upon the following: (i) sale or transfer of such share of Class B common stock, except for permitted transfers as described in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation; (ii) the death or incapacity of the Class B common stockholder (or nine months after the date of the death or incapacity if the stockholder is one of the Company’s founders); and (iii) on the final conversion date, defined as the earliest of (a) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than 
10
% of the then outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock; (b) the last trading day of the fiscal year following the tenth anniversary of the Company’s IPO; or (c) the date specified by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a single class.

Equity Incentive Plans

In September 2014, the Company’s board of directors adopted and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2014 Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The 2014 Plan was also amended and restated in March 2021 and June 2021. Under the 2014 Plan, the board of directors may grant stock options and other equity-based awards to eligible employees, directors, and consultants. The 2014 Plan was terminated in June 2021 in connection with the IPO, but continues to govern the terms of outstanding awards that were granted prior to the termination of the 2014 Plan. No further equity awards will be granted under the 2014 Plan. With the establishment of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or reacquisition of any shares of Class B common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2014 Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock will become available for grant under the 2021 Plan. Equity-based awards granted under the 2014 Plan and the 2021 Plan generally vest over two to four years. All stock option grants expire ten years from the date of grant.

In April 2021, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and in June 2021, the Company’s 
stockholders approved, the 2021 Plan, which became effective at the time of the execution of the underwriting agreement related to the Company’s IPO. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units awards, performance awards, and other forms of awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of the Company’s affiliates. A total of 
25,812,876
 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Plan in addition to (i) the shares that remained available for grant of future awards under the 2014 Plan at the time the 2021 Plan became effective, (ii) shares underlying outstanding stock awards granted under the 2014 Plan that expire, or are forfeited, cancelled, or reacquired, as described above, and (iii) any automatic increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan. 
On January 1, 2024, the shares available for grant under the 2021 Plan were automatically increased by 
15,575,577
 shares pursuant to the 2021 Plan.

In April 2021, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and in June 2021, the Company’s 
stockholders approved, the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2021 ESPP”), which became effective at the time of the execution of the underwriting agreement related to the Company’s IPO. The 2021 ESPP authorizes the issuance of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. A total of 
5,162,575
 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the 2021 ESPP, in addition to any automatic increases in the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan. 
On January 1, 2024, the shares available for grant under the 2021 ESPP were automatically increased by 
3,115,115
 shares pursuant to the 2021 ESPP.

Except for the initial offering period, the 2021 ESPP provides for 12-month offering periods generally beginning on February 16 and August 16 of each year, and each offering period consists of two six-month purchase periods. The price at which Class A common stock is purchased under the 2021 ESPP is equal to 
85
% of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the offering date or (2) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the purchase date.

The 2021 ESPP offers a rollover feature pursuant to which, if the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the first trading day of a new purchase period is lower than the fair market value on the offering date, that offering period will terminate and participants will be automatically enrolled in a new 12-month offering period. ESPP rollovers occurred in August 2022, February 2023, and August 2024, which triggered new 12-month offering periods. The rollovers were accounted for as a modification to the original offering and res
ulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the remaining requisite service periods. The incremental stock-based compensation was not material for the August 2022 and February 2023 rollovers, and $
4.3
 million for the August 2024 rollover.

Early Exercised Options

All stock option holders have the right to exercise unvested options, which are subject to a repurchase right held by the Company at the original exercise price in the event of voluntary or involuntary termination of employment of the stockholder. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, there were 
8,173
 and 
135,013
 shares that had been early exercised and were subject to repurchase, respectively.

Restricted Common Stock

During the year ended December 31, 2024, in connection with the WarpStream Labs business combination discussed in Note 7 Business Combinations, the Company issued 
397,436
 shares of Class A common stock to certain employees of WarpStream Labs. These shares are subject to holdback arrangements, pursuant to which the vesting is subject to continued employment over three years and achievement of certain milestones. The $
7.9
 million fair value of these shares is accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period when it is probable the performance-based vesting condition will be achieved. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
397,436
 shares remained unvested.

Restricted common stock is included in issued and outstanding shares as they are legally issued and outstanding, but are not deemed outstanding for accounting purposes until the shares vest.

Table of Contents

Determination of Fair Value

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options and ESPP rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is dependent upon several variables, such as the fair value of the Company’s common stock, the expected option term, expected volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term, expected risk-free interest rate over the expected option term, and expected dividend yield.

Fair Value of Common Stock
: Since the Company’s IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common stock is determined by the closing price, on the date of grant, of its Class A common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Expected Term
: For option grants subject to service-based vesting conditions only, the expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock options are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using the simplified method for options that have only service-based vesting conditions. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For other option grants, the Company estimates the expected term using historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior, considering the contractual life of the award.

Expected Volatility
: Prior to July 2023, the expected volatility was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of public companies within the Company’s industry that it considers to be comparable to its business, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock options, since the Company did not have a sufficient trading history of its common stock. Beginning in July 2023, the Company uses a weighted average volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of public companies within the Company’s industry to develop its expected volatility assumption.

Risk-Free Interest Rate
: The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with maturities equivalent to the option’s expected term.

Expected Dividend Yield
: The Company has not issued any dividends in its history and does not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options and therefore has estimated the dividend yield to be 
zero
.

12. Restructuring and Other Related Charges

In January 2023, the Company approved restructuring actions (the “Restructuring Plan”) to adjust its cost structure and real estate footprint. The Restructuring Plan includes a reduction of approximately 
8

34.9
 million, consisting of $
19.2
 million related to 
employee transition and severance payments, employee benefits, and related facilitation costs, and $
15.7
 million of lease abandonment charges.

In December 2023, the Company completed an intra-group transfer of acquired intellectual property related to the acquisition of immerok GmbH and recognized foreign current tax expense of $
26.4
 million resulting from the intra-group transfer. This foreign current tax expense is recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and other liabilities, non-current as of December 31, 2023 on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded a U.S. deferred tax asset of $
17.8
 million from a step-up in the tax basis of the intellectual property. Based on available objective evidence, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the additional U.S. deferred tax asset will not be realizable and is therefore offset by a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Company recognizes a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to a history of losses in the United States and United Kingdom, U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance was $
671.7
 million as of December 31, 2024 and increased by $
84.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to increased capitalized research and development costs, tax credit carryforwards, and capitalized intangible asset costs. The valuation allowance was $
587.7
 million as of December 31, 2023 and increased by $
126.5
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased U.S. federal and state loss carryforwards, intangible assets, capitalized research and development costs, and tax credit carryforwards.

Table of Contents

Based on the Company’s assessment of the U.K.’s current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that the Company may have sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.K. within the next 12 months. However, the Company’s judgment regarding the U.K.’s future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any U.K. valuation allowance release are subject to change due to many factors, including future market conditions, the ability to successfully execute its business plans, and the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future. Release of the U.K. valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and would decrease income tax expense in the period the release is recorded.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company has accrued $
2.7
 million of deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes on amounts of non-U.S. earnings that the Company plans to repatriate. For the non-U.S. earnings the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest, the estimated amount of any incremental tax associated with such earnings is immaterial.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had $
1,403.6
 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and $
560.8
 million of state net operating loss carryforwards. The federal net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, but are limited to 80% of annual taxable income. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had U.S. federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of $
87.5
 million and $
38.0
 million, respectively. The U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2038. The California research tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, while the research tax credit carryforwards for other states will begin to expire in 2026.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had $
58.9
 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. These foreign net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite life and do not expire.

Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar provisions of state law, utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change. As of December 31, 2024, the Company assessed that its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will not expire solely due to Section 382 limitations.

As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not affect the Company’s effective tax rate due to the existence of carryforwards and the valuation allowance in the United States and applicable U.S. state jurisdictions.

The Company does not expect its gross unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next 12 months. It is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next 12 months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. There were 
no
 interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

The Company’s tax years from inception in 2014 through December 31, 2024
 remain subject to examination by various jurisdictions.

The Company calculates the potential dilutive effect of its 2027 Notes under the if-converted method. Under this method, diluted net loss per share is determined by assuming that all of the 2027 Notes were converted into shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at the beginning of the reporting period.

In connection with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, the Company entered into Capped Calls, which are not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to partially offset the potential dilution to the Company’s Class A common stock upon any conversion of the 2027 Notes.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

134

Table of Contents

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Executive Officer Change in Control/Severance Benefit Plan

On February 12, 2025, our board of directors amended the Confluent, Inc. Executive

Officer Change in Control/Severance Benefit Plan (as amended, the “Severance Plan”) pursuant to which the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and other executive staff (“non-CEO E-Staff”), which includes the Company’s current named executive officers, are eligible to participate.

The Severance Plan provides that, in the event of a participant’s termination of employment by Confluent without “cause” or by the individual for “good reason” (each as defined in the Severance Plan) that occurs during the time period commencing three months prior to and ending 12 months following a change in control (referred to as the change in control period), we will provide the following severance benefits, contingent upon the conditions set forth in the Severance Plan (referred to as the severance conditions): (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to 18 months of base salary for our CEO and 12 months of base salary for our non-CEO E-Staff, (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to 100% of the annual target cash bonus for the applicable fiscal year for both our CEO and non-CEO E-Staff, (iii) up to 18 months COBRA coverage for our CEO and up to 12 months of COBRA coverage for our non-CEO E-Staff, and (iv) 100% of the time-vesting equity awards will vest in full and become immediately exercisable for both our CEO and non-CEO E-Staff.

The Severance Plan also provides that, in the event of a participant’s termination of employment by the Company without “cause” outside of a change in control period, we will provide the following severance benefits, contingent upon the severance conditions:  (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to 12 months of base salary for our CEO and six months of base salary for our non-CEO E-Staff and (ii) up to 12 months of COBRA coverage for our CEO and up to six months of COBRA coverage for our non-CEO E-Staff.

The benefits provided under the Severance Plan supersede any severance benefit plan, policy or practice previously maintained by Confluent or change in control severance arrangements described in a participant’s offer letter with Confluent, except that, if a participant has more favorable vesting acceleration provisions in another agreement with Confluent, the most favorable vesting provisions will apply.

A copy of the Severance Plan is attached as Exhibit 10.16 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
