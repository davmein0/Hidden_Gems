Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Investing in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. An investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk due to the nature of our business and the present stage of exploration and development of our mineral properties. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Part II, Item 7. entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in any documents incorporated in this Annual Report by reference, before deciding whether to invest in our common shares. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects and could cause them to differ materially from the estimates described in forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. In such an event, the market price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Although we have discussed risks we have identified as material risks, the risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Certain statements below are forward-looking statements. See also “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report.
Risk Factor Summary
The following is a summary of important risk factors that are specific to our business, industry and our incorporation under the laws of British Columbia:
●
Our ability to continue the exploration, permitting, development, and construction of the Project, and to continue as a going concern, will depend in part on our ability to obtain suitable financing.
●
We do not currently have sufficient funds or committed financing necessary to commence construction of the Project, and we may be unable to raise the necessary funds.
●
Funding under the U.S. EXIM letter of interest is subject to an application and diligence process, and the amount and timing of such funding, if any, is uncertain and subject to conditions outside the Company’s control.
●
A strategic transaction, whether or not consummated, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.
●
Our funding under the TIA is subject to certain conditions, limitations and ongoing obligations. If we fail to satisfy these conditions, we may be unable to obtain all of the funding allocated to Perpetua Resources or may be required to disgorge such funds.
●
We require various permits to commence construction and operation of the Project and any future operations, and delays or a failure to obtain such permits, or a failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have obtained, could have a material adverse impact on us.
●
We have no history of commercially producing precious metals from our mineral properties and there can be no assurance that we will successfully establish mining operations or profitably produce precious metals.
●
Perpetua Resources’ future exploration and development efforts may be unsuccessful.
●
Perpetua Resources’ mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates may not be indicative of the actual gold or other minerals that can be mined.
●
Perpetua Resources faces numerous uncertainties in estimating economically recoverable mineral reserves and mineral resources, and inaccuracies in estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.
●
Perpetua Resources’ title to its mineral properties and its validity may be disputed in the future by others claiming title to all or part of such properties.
●
Perpetua Resources has a history of net losses and expects losses to continue for the foreseeable future.
●
We have a limited property portfolio.
●
Perpetua Resources faces substantial competition within the mining industry from other mineral companies with much greater financial and technical resources and Perpetua Resources may not be able to effectively compete.
●
We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, where compliance failure may impact our operations.
●
Our operations, including permitting, currently are and in the future may be subject to legal challenges, which could result in adverse impacts to our business and financial condition.
●
Our operations are subject to climate change risks. 
●
Increasing attention to ESG matters and conservation measures may adversely impact our business. 
●
Perpetua Resources depends on key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts but does not maintain key person insurance.

●
Perpetua Resources does not have a full staff of technical experts and relies upon outside consultants to provide critical 
services.
●
Certain Perpetua Resources directors and officers also serve as officers and/or directors of other mining companies, which may give rise to conflicts.
●
Perpetua Resources’ business involves risks for which Perpetua Resources may not be adequately insured, if it is insured at all.
●
A shortage of supplies and equipment, or the inability to obtain such supplies and equipment when needed and at expected prices, could adversely affect Perpetua Resources’ ability to operate its business.
●
Resource exploration and development is a high risk, speculative business.
●
Mineral exploration and development is subject to numerous industry operating hazards and risks, many of which are beyond Perpetua Resources’ control and any one of which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition and operations.
●
Metal prices have fluctuated widely in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future, which may adversely affect the amount of revenues derived from the future commercial production.
●
Rising metal prices encourage mining exploration, development, and construction activity, which in the past has increased demand for and cost of contract mining services and equipment.
●
Global financial markets can have a profound impact on the global economy in general and on the mining industry in particular.
●
Our business could be negatively impacted by inflationary pressures, which may increase our operating costs and decrease our access to capital required to operate our business.
●
Changes in U.S. administrative policy, including the imposition of or increases in tariffs on steel and/or other raw materials, changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations, may have an adverse effect on us.
●
The requirements of being a public company in the United States and Canada and maintaining a dual listing on both Nasdaq and the TSX, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and applicable securities laws of Canada, may strain our resources, increase our costs, and require significant management time and resources.
●
For as long as we are an “emerging growth company,” or a “smaller reporting company” we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements that apply to some other public companies, and such reduced disclosures requirement may make our Common Shares less attractive.
●
Provisions in the Company’s corporate charter documents and Canadian law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to its shareholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by the shareholders to replace or remove the Company’s current management and/or limit the market price of the Common Shares. 
●
Because we are a corporation incorporated in British Columbia and some of our directors and officers may reside, now or in the future, in Canada, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce civil liabilities against us based solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States. Similarly, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to enforce civil liabilities against our directors and officers that reside outside of Canada. 
●
Perpetua Resources has no history of paying dividends, does not expect to pay dividends in the immediate future and may never pay dividends.
●
Perpetua Resources will need to raise additional capital through the sale of its securities or other interests, resulting in potential for significant dilution to the existing shareholders and, if such funding is not available, Perpetua Resources’ operations would be adversely affected.
●
Future sales of Perpetua Resources’ common shares into the public market by holders of Perpetua Resources options and warrants may lower the market price, which may result in losses to Perpetua Resources’ shareholders.
●
Our largest shareholder has significant influence on us and may also affect the market price and liquidity of our securities.
●
In the future, we may be subject to legal proceedings.
●
We are subject to taxation both in Canada and the United States, and shareholders may be subject to Canadian and U.S. withholding and certain other taxes.
●
We are required to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
●
If securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
●
System security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise proprietary or otherwise sensitive information or disrupt operations, which could adversely affect Perpetua Resources’ business, reputation, operations, and stock price.

Risk Factor Discussion
Risks Related to Our Business
Our ability to continue the exploration, permitting, development, and construction of the Project, and to continue as a going concern, will depend in part on our ability to obtain suitable financing.
We have limited financial resources. We will need external financing to develop and construct the Project and to complete the permitting process. The Company’s latest liquidity forecast indicates that available cash resources for expenses not eligible for reimbursement under the TIA (as defined below) are expected to be exhausted in the third quarter of 2025. We expect to incur other costs in the foreseeable future that are not eligible for reimbursement under the TIA and may incur unanticipated increases to costs as a result of inflation, fuel or labor costs or other factors. Furthermore, only approximately $10 million remained available for reimbursement under the TIA as of December 31, 2024, and costs must be incurred on or before June 16, 2025 to be eligible for reimbursement. Once such funding is exhausted or has expired, the Company will need to seek new funding sources for expenses currently reimbursed through the TIA. The Company continues to explore various funding opportunities, which may include the issuance of additional equity, new debt, or project specific debt; government funding; and/or other financing or strategic opportunities. In particular, the Company has engaged RBC Capital Markets and Endeavour Financial to assist with the evaluation of potential strategic and financing opportunities and to support the Company’s application process in connection with the U.S. EXIM $1.8 billion Letter of Interest received in April 2024. Any such financing or strategic transaction, or any funding commitment from U.S. EXIM, will be subject to due diligence, the negotiation of funding terms and other conditions, and there can be no assurance of the amount, timing or nature of any such financing or strategic transaction, if any, and any such financing or strategic transaction may not be consummated at all. Additionally, the potential costs of obtaining such financing or any strategic transaction can be significant and may put additional strains on our cash flows. Furthermore, in May 2023 the Company entered into the Sales Agreement (as defined herein) with respect to an ATM Offering (as defined herein); however, only $6.2 million remained available under the program as of December 31, 2024. Sales under the program are also subject to certain conditions, including market conditions, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds under the program, at acceptable stock prices or at all. If additional financing is not secured before the third quarter of 2025, the Company would no longer be able to meet its ongoing obligations or advance construction readiness activities.
We do not currently have sufficient funds or committed financing necessary to commence construction of the Project, and we may be unable to raise the necessary funds.
We have commenced pre-construction engineering and other preparations with the goal of commencing construction of the Project in 2025. According to the Financial Update, as of December 31, 2024, the total initial capital cost estimate for the Project was approximately $2,215 million.
We do not currently have sufficient funds or committed financing to commence construction of the Project. Our ability to obtain sufficient funds or committed financing on acceptable terms, or at all, may be impacted by various factors, including, but not limited to, unfavorable market conditions or commodity pricing; unfavorable interest rates; regulatory uncertainty; the incurrence of additional debt, which may be subject to certain restrictive covenants; restrictions on our use of government funding and permitting delays or challenges to our existing permits. The cost and terms of such financing, if obtained, may significantly reduce the expected benefits from development of the Project and/or render such development uneconomic, including by imposing restrictive covenants; limiting our ability to control certain property or development decisions as a result of our entry into joint ventures or other similar arrangements; the loss of certain economic benefits of our property as a result of our entry into royalty or similar agreements; or dilution to existing shareholders resulting from additional equity financing.
Our failure to obtain sufficient financing could result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration, permitting, development, construction, or production at the Project. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available when needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable. Our failure to obtain financing could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and results of operations and financial condition.
Funding under the U.S. EXIM letter of interest is subject to an application and diligence process, and the amount and timing of such funding, if any, is uncertain and subject to conditions outside the Company’s control.
On April 8, 2024, the Company announced that it received a non-binding and conditional Letter of Interest from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (“U.S. EXIM”) for potential debt financing of up to $1.8 billion through U.S. EXIM’s “Make More in America” and “China and Transformational Exports Program” initiatives. The Company expects to submit a formal application to U.S. EXIM in the second quarter of 2025. Upon receipt of an application for financing, U.S. EXIM will conduct the due diligence necessary

to determine if a final commitment may be issued. Any final commitment will be dependent on meeting U.S. EXIM’s underwriting criteria, authorization process, finalization and satisfaction of terms and conditions. All final commitments must comply with U.S. EXIM policies as well as program, legal and eligibility requirements. 
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully satisfy any or all of such conditions. In particular, one condition of funding is that the Company raise a certain amount of equity financing. The Company may be unable to raise such additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If such condition is satisfied through an issuance of common shares, shareholders may experience significant dilution (see
