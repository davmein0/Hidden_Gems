Item 3. Legal Proceedings
, below.
Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act and other similar laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions. Additionally, the U.S. EPA establishes and periodically reviews emissions standards that require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants, and we are required to comply with such emissions standards. The U.S. EPA and state agencies such as the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality have the ability to issue citations and orders and assess penalties for violations of permits or other applicable regulatory requirements.
Mine and Safety Health Administration
Mining operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine and Safety Health Administration (“MSHA”) which carries out the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. MSHA enforces the health and safety rules for all U.S mines and conducts mine inspections regarding compliance with applicable laws and regulations. MSHA has the ability to issue citations and orders and assess penalties for health and safety violations.
District Exploration
No exploration drilling was conducted by the Company during the reporting period. Some laboratory test work was completed to support requirements under the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium agreement. Other site activities during the reporting period focused on maintaining claim location monuments and surveying, studies to support permitting and design, engineering and environmental studies to support the ongoing activities related to the ASAOC. 
Employees
At December 31, 2024, the Corporation had 36 full time employees and 1 part time employee. 34 employees were directly related to the mineral development activities of the Stibnite Gold Project and the remaining 3 employees were focused on executive management, investor relations and administrative support of the Corporation. A total of 27 employees were employed in Idaho, with many of the Perpetua Resources team working remotely. The Corporation also contracts out certain activities to contractors with specific skills to assist with various aspects of the Project.

Competition
The gold and critical mineral exploration and mining business is a competitive business. The Corporation competes with numerous other companies possessing greater financial and technical research resources. Competition is particularly intense with respect to the acquisition of desirable, undeveloped gold or critical mineral properties. The Corporation’s competitive strength is due, in part, to having the only antimony reserves in the United States. If additional accessible sources of antimony become available or demand is reduced, the Corporation’s ability to access funding or government support may be affected. We also encounter competition for the hiring of key personnel. This competition could adversely impact our ability to advance the Project, acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future on terms we consider acceptable, attract necessary capital funding or acquire an interest in additional properties. See 
Item 1A., Risk Factors
, below.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
Our commitment to ESG practices is explained in our ESG Policy. Our ESG Policy, Sustainability Roadmap and our 2023 Sustainability Report can be found on the Company’s website. Information on our website is neither part of, nor incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Availability of Raw Materials
The raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in the United States and Canada. Historically, we have been able to secure the appropriate equipment and supplies required to conduct our contemplated programs. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future. See also section 
Item 1A, Risk Factors – 
“
A shortage of supplies and equipment, or the inability to obtain such supplies and equipment when needed and at expected prices, could adversely affect Perpetua Resources’ ability to operate its business.” and “Changes in U.S. administrative policy, including the imposition of or increases in tariffs on steel and/or other raw materials, changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international trade relations, may have an adverse effect on us.”
Gold Price History
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global and regional gold demand, and international and national political and economic conditions.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) enacted in April 2012. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include:
●
an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
●
an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
●
an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
●
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
●
the last day of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.235 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest $1.0 million) or more;
●
the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”);
●
the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or
●
the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates (or public float) exceeds $700.0 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter in our prior fiscal year.
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than what you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
Available Information
We file or furnish annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains a website (
www.sec.gov
) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including Perpetua, that file electronically with the SEC. We are also subject to requirements of the applicable securities laws of Canada, and documents that we file with the Canadian Securities Administrators may be found at 
www.sedarplus.ca
.
We make available free of charge through our website (
www.perpetuaresources.com
) our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC or the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada. In addition to the reports filed or furnished with the SEC and the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada, we publicly disclose information from time to time in our press releases, investor presentations posted on our website and at publicly accessible conferences. Such information, including information posted on or connected to our website, is not a part of, or incorporated by reference in, this Annual Report or any other document we file with or furnish to the SEC or the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada.
We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy (the “Code of Conduct”) that applies to our management and to our other employees. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K relating to amendments to or waivers from any provision of our Code of Conduct applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and other persons performing similar functions by posting such information on our website (
www.perpetuaresources.com
