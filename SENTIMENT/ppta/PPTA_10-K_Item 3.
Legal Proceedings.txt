” in 
Item 1A
 of this Annual Report.
Statements concerning mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking information to the extent that such statements involve estimates of the mineralization that may be encountered if a property is developed.
With respect to forward-looking information contained herein, the Company has applied several material factors or assumptions including, but not limited to, certain assumptions as to production rates, operating costs, recovery and metal costs; that any additional financing needed will be available when needed on reasonable terms; that the current exploration, development, environmental and other objectives concerning the Company’s Stibnite Gold Project (the “Project” or “Stibnite Gold Project”) can be achieved and that the Company’s other corporate activities will proceed as expected; that Perpetua will be able to successfully obtain financing for the Project; that all requisite information will be available in a timely manner; that the current price and demand for gold, antimony and other metals will be sustained or will improve; that general business and economic conditions will not change in a materially adverse manner and that all necessary governmental approvals for the planned exploration, development and environmental protection activities on the Project will be obtained in a timely manner and on acceptable terms, and that the Company or such agencies will be able to successful defend against any challenges to such governmental approvals; and that the continuity of economic and political conditions and operations of the Company will be sustained.
These risks are not exhaustive. Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, may be materially different from the anticipated or estimated results discussed in the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors nor can we assess the effects of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. Our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements, which represent our beliefs, assumptions and estimates only as of the dates on which they were made, as predictions of future events. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even though circumstances may change in the future, except as required under applicable securities laws. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

The following is a glossary of certain terms used in this Annual Report:
Assay
 means, in economic geology, to analyze the proportions of metal in a rock or overburden sample; to test an ore or mineral for composition, purity, weight or other properties of commercial interest.
CERCLA
 means Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, referenced informally as “Superfund.”
Deposit
 means a mineralized body which has been physically delineated by sufficient drilling, trenching, and/or underground work, and found to contain a sufficient average grade of metal or metals to warrant further exploration and/or development expenditures; such a deposit does not qualify as a commercially mineable ore body or as containing ore reserves, until final legal, technical, and economic factors have been resolved.
g/t Au
 means grams of gold per metric tonne of material.
Grade

or grade
 means the amount of valuable metal in each tonne of ore, expressed as grams per tonne (g/t) for precious metals and as percent (%) for antimony.
km
 means kilometre(s).
m
 means metre(s) (equivalent to 3.281 feet).
M
 means million.
Mineralization

or mineralization 
means the concentration of metals and their chemical compounds within a body of rock.
Mineral Reserve 
or
 mineral reserve
 means an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted.
Mineral Resource 
or
 mineral resource
 means a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable. It is not merely an inventory of all mineralization drilled or sampled.
Ore
 means a mineral reserve of sufficient value as to quality and quantity to enable it to be mined at a profit.
Ounce or oz
 means a troy ounce or twenty penny weights or 480 grains and is equivalent to 31.1035 grams.
Oz/t or oz/st
 means a troy ounce per short ton.

Sampling

or sampling
 means a technique for collecting representative sub-volumes from a larger volume of geological material. The particular sampling method employed depends on the nature of the material being sampled and the kind of information required.
NOTICE REGARDING MINING PROPERTY DISCLOSURE RULES
The material scientific and technical information in respect of the Stibnite Gold Project in this Annual Report, unless otherwise indicated, is based upon information contained in the Technical Report Summary (the “TRS”), dated as of December 31, 2021, and amended as of June 6, 2022, developed for the Stibnite Gold Project in accordance with the mining property disclosure rules specified in Regulation S-K subpart 1300 (“S-K 1300”) promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The TRS summarizes, in accordance with the mining property disclosure rules specified in S-K 1300, the technical report titled “Stibnite Gold Project, Feasibility Study Technical Report, Valley County, Idaho” dated effective December 22, 2020 and issued January 27, 2021 (the “2020 Feasibility Study”), which was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosures an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ from the mining property disclosure rules specified in S-K 1300. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits from the TRS set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with NI 43-101.
The updated financial information in respect of the Stibnite Gold Project in this Annual Report is based upon information contained in the Financial Update – Cash Flow Forecast for the Stibnite Gold Project, February 2025 (the “Financial Update”), which is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Financial Update should be read as a supplemental financial update to the 2020 Feasibility Study, which is summarized in the Company’s TRS, with respect to economic information regarding the Project. Neither the Financial Update nor the studies or data underlying such update modifies the mineral resources and mineral reserves reported in the TRS or the material assumptions and information pertaining to such disclosure. The information contained in the Financial Update is subject to the assumptions, exclusions and qualifications set forth herein, as well as those contained in the 2020 Feasibility Study and the TRS, except to the extent explicitly updated herein.
The 2020 Feasibility Study, the TRS and the Financial Update are intended to be read as a whole and sections should not be read or relied upon out of context.
All disclosures contained in this Annual Report regarding the mineral reserves and mineral resource estimates and economic analysis on the property are fully qualified by the full disclosure contained in the 2020 Feasibility Study and the TRS. 
Information of a scientific or technical nature in this Annual Report and the Financial Update have been approved by Christopher Dail, AIPG CPG #10596, Exploration Manager for Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. and a Qualified Person (as defined in NI 43-101 and as defined in S-K 1300).
