Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
The Corporation and its subsidiaries have been parties to an ongoing legal proceeding with the Nez Perce Tribe for claimed violations of the CWA allegedly linked to historical mining activities. In August 2019, the Nez Perce Tribe filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho. The Company filed an answer generally denying liability and later, the court allowed the Company to amend and file a third-party complaint against the Forest Service. The Company also filed a separate CWA citizen suit against the USFS alleging that several of the point source discharges, as alleged by the Nez Perce Tribe in its complaint, were occurring on lands owned and controlled by the United States government.
Pursuant to the terms of the voluntary ASAOC executed in January 2021 with the U.S. EPA and the USDA, the Company agreed to dismiss its pending actions against the Forest Service without prejudice. On August 8, 2023, the Company and the Nez Perce Tribe filed a final Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) to resolve the tribe’s CWA litigation. The parties jointly asked the court to approve the Settlement Agreement and dismiss the case without prejudice. The Settlement Agreement provides for total payments of $5.0 million by Perpetua over a four-year period. This includes $4.0 million of contributions by Perpetua to a South Fork Salmon Water Quality Enhancement Fund (the “Fund”) to be used by the Nez Perce Tribe to support water quality improvement projects in the South Fork Salmon River watershed and $1.0 million of reimbursements to the Nez Perce Tribe for legal expenses. Following a

45-day review period by the United States Justice Department and the U.S. EPA, the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho approved the Stipulation for Dismissal and entered a Judgment on October 2, 2023, which resulted in the CWA lawsuit being dismissed without prejudice. Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company anticipates that a dismissal with prejudice is contemplated after completion of Perpetua’s required payments. All required payments to date have been made timely pursuant to the terms of the settlement. As of December 31, 2024, the current portion of the settlement was $1,000,000 with the remaining $2,000,000 classified as long-term. See Note 9e to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Certain of the Company’s property interests in the Project site are also subject to existing judicial consent decrees entered into by third parties and various governmental entities. These consent decrees, which impose environmental liability and remediation responsibilities on third parties, apply to certain mining claims and mill sites acquired by Perpetua from those third parties. Under the consent decrees, Perpetua is required to grant access to certain Project site areas by regulatory agencies and allow remediation activities to proceed if necessary and preserve the integrity of previous response actions. Several of the Company’s patented claims in the Hangar Flats and Yellow Pine properties are also subject to a consent decree which requires Perpetua to cooperate with the U.S. EPA and the USFS to implement appropriate response activities. 
Additionally, following the USFS’ publication of the ROD and FEIS authorizing the Modified Mine Plan for the Project, claims were filed against the USFS, the USDA and other federal agencies on February 18, 2025 in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho by a number of claimants, including Save the South Fork Salmon, the Idaho Conservation League and other non-governmental organizations, alleging violations of NEPA and other federal laws in the regulatory process. Among other remedies, the claimants seek to vacate the ROD, FEIS, Final Biological Opinions and Project approvals and enjoin any further implementation of the Project. PRII has filed a motion with the court to intervene in this lawsuit. The Company believes the federal permitting process was conducted thoroughly and completely by the relevant federal regulatory agencies. However, there can be no assurance that the ROD, FEIS, and other Project approvals will be upheld upon judicial review.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) which is administered by MSHA. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and thus no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

2025 Outlook and Goals
Perpetua Resources’ vision is to provide the United States with a domestic source of the critical mineral antimony, develop one of the largest and highest-grade open pit gold mines in the country and restore an abandoned brownfield site. In 2025, Perpetua Resources is focused on receiving the final permits for the Stibnite Gold Project to support a construction decision in 2025 and advancing execution planning to prepare the Project to be construction-ready once all required permits are received.
NEPA Permitting Update
On September 6, 2024, the USFS published the FEIS and a DROD for the Stibnite Gold Project. The FEIS analyzes the potential environmental effects and benefits of the mining and reclamation activities proposed as part of the Stibnite Gold Project. The DROD outlined the USFS’s proposed decision to authorize the Modified Mine Plan and to approve a special use authorization for transmission line upgrades and installation of a new power transmission line with supporting infrastructure. On January 3, 2025, the USFS published the ROD and FEIS Errata authorizing the Modified Mine Plan for the Project. Per the requirements of the FEIS and ROD, numerous plans comprising the suite of Environmental Monitoring and Management Plans are in process and will incorporate Project updates as well as required mitigation measures, environmental protection measures, financial assurance, and design features. This will include preparation of a Final Mine Plan of Operations.
Following the USFS’ publication of the ROD and FEIS authorizing the mine plan for the Project, claims were filed against the USFS, USDA, and other federal agencies on February 18, 2025 in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho by a number of claimants, including Save the South Fork Salmon, the Idaho Conservation League and other non-governmental organizations, alleging violations of NEPA and other federal laws in the regulatory process. Among other remedies, the claimants seek to vacate the ROD, FEIS, Final Biological Opinions and Project approvals and enjoin any further implementation of the Project. PRII has filed a motion with the court to intervene in this lawsuit. The Company believes the federal permitting process was conducted thoroughly and completely by the relevant federal regulatory agencies. However, there can be no assurance that the ROD, FEIS, and other Project approvals will be upheld upon judicial review.
The Company’s CWA Section 404 permit application, proposed Compensatory Mitigation Plan, and associated financial assurance remain under review by the Army Corps after the public comment period ended in October 2023. The Army Corps has been a part of the review process as a cooperating agency since the Company began the federal NEPA process and has been formally evaluating the Section 404 permit application since 2023. The Section 404 permit is the last remaining federal permit required to be issued prior to a construction decision. Perpetua expects the permit to be issued in the first half of 2025. For additional detail regarding the NEPA process, including ongoing challenges to the ROD, see 
Item 1, Business – Permitting and Environmental Matters

Ancillary Permitting Update
With receipt of the ROD, the Corporation is focused on advancing the Project towards a construction decision, including finalizing the remaining federal and state permits and securing project financing. Recent permitting updates include:
●
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued its Final Biological Opinion on September 6, 2024 and the National Marine Fisheries Service issued its Final Biological Opinion on October 7, 2024.
●
In May 2024, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (“IDEQ”) issued its final CWA Section 401 Water Quality Certification for the Project (the “Certification”). In the third quarter of 2024, certain parties initiated a state administrative challenge to the Certification that will require a contested case hearing on certain issues. IDEQ recently filed an extension request in this proceeding that will require rescheduling of the hearing date that had been set for April 2025. The new hearing date has not yet been set.
●
IDEQ issued a Clean Air Act Permit to Construct (“PTC”) in 2022 that was followed by certain state administrative challenges. In the third quarter of 2024, the Board of IDEQ issued an order remanding the PTC for a contested case hearing on certain matters. The hearing was held in October 2024 and the hearing officer issued his decision January 7, 2025 finding in favor of IDEQ and Perpetua on all issues. The petitioners in the contested case subsequently filed an appeal to the IDEQ Board, which has scheduled oral argument on the appeal for April 2025.
●
The Company received a completeness determination from IDEQ on November 2, 2024 for the Project’s cyanidation facility permit and a completeness determination from Idaho Department of Lands on November 6, 2024 for the Project’s cyanidation facility Permanent Closure Plan. On January 1, 2025, the IDEQ completed the Accuracy and Protectiveness Review for certain portions of the permit application and issued a draft cyanidation permit with respect to those portions for a 60-day public comment period.
●
On January 24, 2025, the Director of the IDWR issued a final order granting the Company’s application for certain water rights to be used in connection with the Project.
●
The Idaho Ground Water Management Final Point of Compliance determination was issued in August 2023 and the Company submitted the required groundwater sampling and well installation plans in October 2023.
●
The Company submitted a Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”) dam safety application to Idaho Department of Water Resources (“IDWR”) in July 2023. IDWR sent a letter of conditional approval for the Company’s Stage 1 TSF in October 2023.
Previously submitted permit applications are continuing through the administrative review process. These include applications and plans to IDEQ for the Idaho Pollutant Discharge Elimination System discharge permits, to IDWR for financial assurance, and to IDWR for a stream alteration permit.
Department of Defense Funding 
In September 2022, Perpetua Resources was awarded two funding grants of $100,000 each from the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) under the DLA’s “Production of Energetic Materials and Associated Precursors” Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grant solicitation to study the domestic production of military-grade antimony trisulfide, an essential component in ammunition and dozens of other defense materials. As described in the grant’s objective, the program is focused on reducing “foreign reliance and single points of failure for the domestic manufacturing of energetic materials” through the development of a domestic source. After a competitive review process, Perpetua Resources was awarded SBIR Phase 1 funding of $100,000 under each of the two programs. Under the DLA grants, Perpetua Resources evaluated whether antimony from the Stibnite Gold Project can meet military specifications (“mil-spec”) and also evaluated alternate methods for synthesizing antimony trisulfide. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $nil and $124,997, respectively, was recognized as grant income for these grants. The programs were complete in September 2023 and no further grant income is anticipated under these grants.
In December 2022, Perpetua Resources was awarded an undefinitized TIA of up to $24.8 million under Title III of the DPA. On July 25, 2023, the TIA was definitized with the DOD, establishing the full not-to-exceed amount of $24.8 million and on May 2, 2024, the TIA was modified with an additional $34.4 million in funding, bringing the total amount of available funding under the TIA to $59.2 million. The funding objective of the TIA, issued by the Air Force Research Laboratory, is to complete environmental and engineering studies necessary to obtain a FEIS, a ROD, and other ancillary permits to sustain the domestic production of antimony trisulfide capability for defense energetic materials. The DPA funding allows the Company to advance the construction readiness of the Stibnite Gold Project while the Company continues through the ongoing permitting process, led by the USFS. Under the funding agreement, Perpetua Resources may request reimbursement for certain costs incurred through June 16, 2025 related to environmental baseline data monitoring, environmental and technical studies and other activities related to advancing Perpetua’s construction readiness

and permitting process for the Stibnite Gold Project. The DPA funding does not interrupt the completed and ongoing permitting process. The TIA contains customary terms and conditions for technology investment agreements, including ongoing reporting obligations. Perpetua Resources is evaluating other U.S. government funding opportunities, including programs available through the DOD. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $33,619,111 was recognized as grant income related to the TIA. The Company anticipates recognizing the remaining funds of approximately $10,000,000 as reimbursement for expenses expected to be incurred through June 16, 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company was reimbursed $32,468,545 for certain costs incurred.
On August 18, 2023, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. was awarded an Ordnance Technology Initiative Agreement (“OTIA”) of up to $15.5 million under the Prototype Other Transaction authority of the DOD through the DOD Ordnance Technology Consortium (“DOTC”). The OTIA will build on research conducted under a previously announced Small Business Innovation Research Grant. The funding objective of the OTIA is to demonstrate a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain using ore from the Stibnite Gold Project site. The OTIA designates funding to the Company to conduct activities to meet this objective, including obtaining additional core samples from the Project site, conducting a pilot plant study to produce mil-spec antimony trisulfide from the samples, designing a full-scale process circuit, and delivering a modular pilot plant for the DOD to use in further investigations. Under the OTIA, the Company will be reimbursed for these activities on a cost-plus, fixed-fee basis over the 24-month period of performance. As of December 31, 2024, the current estimated amount of available funding was $15.5 million, which is subject to adjustment by the DOD based on scope, costs, budget, or other factors as the program advances. Perpetua will be entitled to reimbursement for all costs incurred under the agreement, with the negotiated fee being 12%. The OTIA contains customary terms and conditions for OTIAs, including ongoing reporting obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $3,745,935 was recognized as grant income related to the OTIA. The Company anticipates recognizing approximately $6,400,000 of additional grant income in 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company was reimbursed $4,941,834 for certain costs incurred and received a 12% fee of $593,020.
Construction Readiness Activities
The Company is advancing construction readiness activities in parallel with the permitting process. Recent updates include:
●
Appointed mining industry veteran Jonathan Cherry as new President and CEO;
●
Appointed Vice President of Projects to lead the Stibnite Gold Project;
●
Executed construction manager general contractor contract with Ames Construction, while advancing constructability reviews, value engineering studies, and detailed engineering for the Burntlog Route, the Company’s proposed access route, with Ames and the road design consultants;
●
Continued power line detailed scoping and engineering with Idaho Power, who has engaged Kiewit, and identified and initiated procurement of long-lead items required for power line construction;
●
Ausenco Engineering USA South Inc. (“Ausenco”) was awarded Basic and Value Engineering Scope for the Stibnite Gold Project and Basic Engineering work was completed with updated Capital and Operating Costs;
●
Hired key subject matter experts for the Owner’s Team to guide Basic Engineering and overall construction readiness;
●
Commencement of detailed engineering studies with Ausenco;
●
Agreements with Sunshine Silver and U.S. Antimony signed in December 2024 to advance domestic antimony supply chain; and
●
Awarded early contractor involvement contracts to Ames, Ledcor and Sundt for early works planning and execution plan development.
On February 13, 2025, Perpetua entered into an agreement with Idaho Power Company (“IPCo”) to begin procurement of long lead equipment required to increase the electrical capacity to the plant. This is an important step to ensure parts are available for installation under a future construction agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Perpetua is responsible for paying all costs incurred by IPCo as they procure new equipment from vendors with an estimated cost of $90.2 million. All contractual commitments of $1.0 million or greater must be approved by Perpetua prior to IPCo entering a binding contractual commitment with a vendor. The initial payment of $18.8 million was paid following execution and remaining payments are expected to be made quarterly through 2027. Payment dates and amounts may be adjusted to reflect specific contracts entered into by IPCo.

If the agreement is terminated, IPCo will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate cancellation costs and recover value prior to the final true-up payment by Perpetua or refund to Perpetua.

Franco-Nevada Silver Royalty
On March 21, 2024, the Company entered into a royalty agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation (“Franco-Nevada”) pursuant to which Perpetua, through its subsidiaries, sold Franco-Nevada a royalty on the future payable silver production from the Project in exchange for a cash payment of $8.5 million. Silver represents less than 0.3% of projected life-of-mine revenue in the 2020 Feasibility Study. Under the agreement, Franco-Nevada will receive all of the payable silver by-product revenue over the life-of-mine, subject to the terms of the agreement. Perpetua intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Liquidity
The Company’s latest liquidity forecast indicates that available cash resources for expenses not eligible for reimbursement under the DPA funding are expected to be exhausted in the third quarter of 2025. The Company expects to incur other costs in the foreseeable future that are not eligible for DPA funding reimbursement and may incur unanticipated increases to costs as a result of inflation, increased fuel or labor costs or other factors. Furthermore, only approximately $10 million remained available for reimbursement under the TIA as of December 31, 2024, and costs must be incurred on or before June 16, 2025 to be eligible for reimbursement. Once such funding is exhausted or has expired, the Company will need to seek new funding sources for expenses currently reimbursed through the DPA funding. The Company continues to explore various funding opportunities, which may include the issuance of additional equity, new debt, or project specific debt; government funding; and/or other financing or strategic opportunities. In particular, the Company has engaged RBC Capital Markets and Endeavour Financial to assist with the evaluation of potential strategic and financing opportunities and to support the Company’s application process in connection with the U.S. EXIM $1.8 billion Letter of Interest received in April 2024. Any such financing or strategic transaction, or any funding commitment from U.S. EXIM, will be subject to due diligence, the negotiation of funding terms and other conditions, and there can be no assurance of the amount, timing or nature of any such financing or strategic transaction, if any, and any such financing or strategic transaction may not be consummated at all. Additionally, the potential costs of obtaining such financing or any strategic transaction can be significant and may put additional strains on our cash flows. Absent additional financing, the Company would no longer be able to meet its ongoing obligations or advance construction readiness activities. See “—

Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $14.5 million compared with a net loss of $18.8 million for 2023. This $4.3 million decrease for the year was primarily attributable to a $16.3 million increase in grant income and a $5.0 million decrease in CWA settlement expense. These changes were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in exploration costs, a $0.7 million increase in corporate salaries and benefits, and a $0.6 million increase in environmental liability expense. As noted above, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s main focus was the continued evaluation and advancement of the Stibnite Gold Project.
Corporate Salaries and Benefits
This expense results from salaries and benefits of the employees that are not directly related to the exploration and evaluation of the Stibnite Gold Project, primarily corporate employees. Salaries and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $0.7 million, or 37.1%, higher than the previous year due to a higher corporate salary and higher share-based compensation.
Directors’ Fees
Each of the Corporation’s non-executive directors is entitled to annual base fees paid in quarterly installments, with the Independent Lead Director, Chairs of Board Committees and Members of Board Committees receiving additional fees commensurate with each role. Directors’ fees are inclusive of cash fees and share-based compensation (deferred share units and share purchase options). This expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, is $0.1 million, or 15.4%, higher than the previous year primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense.
Exploration
This expense relates to all exploration and evaluation expenditures related to the Stibnite Gold Project, including labor, drilling, field office costs, engineering, permitting, environmental and legal and sustainability costs. The Company’s exploration expenses of $45.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 are $15.4 million, or 51.4%, higher than the previous year primarily due to a $13.4 million increase in engineering costs, a $1.9 million increase in consulting and labor costs, and a $1.2 million increase in field office and drilling support costs partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in permitting costs. Engineering expenses for the year ended

Environmental Liability Expense
This expense relates to the ASAOC signed in January 2021 to voluntarily address environmental conditions at the abandoned mine site. Upon signing of the ASAOC, the Company recorded an immediate expense of $7.5 million and a corresponding environmental reclamation liability. Cost estimates were developed with the use of engineering consultants, independent contractor quotes and the Company’s internal development team, and the timing of cash flows is based on the current schedule for early action items. In the year ended December 31, 2024, the total cost estimate to complete Phase 1 early response actions increased $0.6 million compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a higher estimated increase in the current period for the remaining Phase 1 work to be performed. As of December 31, 2024, the estimate for the remaining environmental liability for Phase 1 work under the ASAOC is $nil.
CWA Settlement Expense
This expense relates to the settlement with the Nez Perce Tribe to resolve the CWA litigation. The Settlement Agreement provides for total payments of $5.0 million by the Company over a four-year period. The Company recognized $5.0 million in 2023 for this settlement. During 2024, the Company paid $2.0 million against this payable and a total balance of $3.0 million is accrued as of December 31, 2024.
General and Administration
This expense is related predominantly to the costs of insurance policies for our U.S. offices and is 4.1%, lower for the year ended December 31, 2024 than the previous year.
Professional Fees
This expense relates to the legal, accounting and consulting costs of the Corporation. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 is $0.1 million, or 7.1%, higher than the previous year primarily due to an increase in accounting and auditing fees and legal costs.
Shareholder and Regulatory
This expense relates to marketing, licenses and fees, and shareholder communications. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 is $0.02 million, or 4.8%, higher than the previous year primarily due to an increase in licenses and fees.
Grant Income
This income is from funding grants awarded to the Company from the DOD to study the domestic production of military-grade antimony trisulfide and to complete environmental and engineering studies necessary to obtain a FEIS, a ROD, and other ancillary permits to sustain the domestic production of antimony trisulfide capability for defense energetic materials. During the year ended December 31, 2024, grant income increased $16.3 million as a result of two new larger grants received during 2023 that continued in 2024. See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

This income results from interest received on the Corporation’s cash balances. The income for the year ended December 31, 2024 is $0.2 million, or 44.4%, lower than the previous year primarily due to lower average cash balance during 2024 than in 2023.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Capital Resources
Capital resources of Perpetua Resources consist primarily of cash and liquid short-term investments. As of December 31, 2024, Perpetua Resources had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $44.1 million, approximately $2.6 million in receivables, principally from DOD grants, $0.7 million in prepaid assets, and $5.7 million in trade and other payables.
ATM Offering 
On May 12, 2023, the Corporation entered into the Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) providing for the sale by the Corporation, from time to time, of the Corporation’s common shares having an aggregate gross offering price of up to $20.0 million (the “ATM Offering”). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation sold 1,834,104 common shares in exchange for proceeds of approximately $10.4 million, which is net of offering costs of approximately $0.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation sold 894,882 common shares in exchange for proceeds of approximately $2.1 million, which is net of offering costs of approximately $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate offering amount of $6.2 million of common shares remained available for issuance and sale under the program. The Company may issue shares under the ATM from time to time.
Equity Offering
On November 18, 2024, the Corporation entered into an underwriting agreement providing for the sale by the Corporation of 3,439,465 of its common shares to the underwriters at a price of $10.17 per share. Proceeds received from the offering were approximately $33.2 million, which is net of offering costs of approximately $1.8 million, and have been, or will be, used for down payments on long lead time materials, detailed engineering for the Project, and general corporate purposes. The Corporation granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 515,919 shares within 30 days of the offering which they did not exercise.
DOD Funding
In December 2022, the Company was awarded an undefinitized TIA of up to $24.8 million under Title III of the DPA. On July 25, 2023, the TIA was definitized with the DOD, establishing the full not-to-exceed amount of $24.8 million and, on May 2, 2024, the TIA was modified to provide for an additional $34.4 million in funding, bringing the total amount of funding available under the TIA to $59.2 million. Under the TIA, Perpetua Resources may request reimbursement for certain costs incurred through June 16, 2025 related to environmental baseline data monitoring, environmental and technical studies and other activities related to advancing Perpetua’s construction readiness and permitting process for the Stibnite Gold Project, which includes reimbursement of employee wages for activities included in the scope of the TIA. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $33.6 million was recognized as grant income related to the TIA. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company was reimbursed $32.5 million for certain costs incurred, and received reimbursement of an additional $2.4 million in February 2025 under the TIA with respect to expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, $10.0 million of additional funding remained available under the TIA, which the Company expects to be incurred through June 16, 2025 and reimbursed.
U.S. EXIM Indication of Interest 
On April 8, 2024, the Company announced that it received a non-binding and conditional Letter of Interest from U.S. EXIM for potential debt financing of up to $1.8 billion through U.S. EXIM’s “Make More in America” and “China and Transformational Exports Program” initiatives. The Company expects to submit a formal application to U.S. EXIM in the second quarter of 2025. Upon receipt of an application for financing, U.S. EXIM will conduct the due diligence necessary to determine if a final commitment may be issued. Any final commitment will be dependent on meeting U.S. EXIM’s underwriting criteria, authorization process, finalization and satisfaction of terms and conditions. All final commitments must comply with U.S. EXIM policies as well as program, legal and eligibility requirements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully satisfy any or all of such conditions on the expected timeline, or at all. See 
Item 1A, Risk Factors - Funding under the U.S. EXIM letter of interest is subject to an application

and diligence process, and the amount and timing of such funding, if any, is uncertain and subject to conditions outside the Company’s control
. 
Liquidity
Perpetua Resources’ current liquidity needs relate to its plans to:
●
Advance construction readiness for the Project, including completing Detailed Engineering and ordering long-lead items;
●
Continue to advance the regulatory process for the restoration and redevelopment of the Project and obtain final pre-construction permits;
●
Continue engaging with Project stakeholders to provide those stakeholders with the opportunity for a better understanding of the Project concepts and to provide a forum for such stakeholders to provide further input into the Project;
●
Continue to collect environmental baseline data in support of the ongoing regulatory processes related to permitting for site restoration and redevelopment of the Project; and
●
Make required payments under the CWA Settlement Agreement.
Although the Company’s current capital resources and liquidity include up to $10.0 million in remaining funding available under the modified TIA as of December 31, 2024, such funding is available only for the specified costs described above. Although we expect the DPA funding to provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to complete permitting on the current timeline as well as additional liquidity to advance some construction readiness activities, due to payments under the Settlement Agreement and other corporate expenses, as well as the expiration of the DPA funding, we do not expect the Company will have sufficient assets to discharge its liabilities as they become due for at least 12 months from the date hereof.
The Company’s latest liquidity forecast indicates that available cash resources for expenses not eligible for reimbursement under the TIA are expected to be exhausted in the third quarter of 2025. Absent additional financing, the Company would no longer be able to meet its ongoing obligations or advance construction readiness activities. The Company continues to explore various strategic and funding opportunities, which may include the issuance of additional equity, new debt, or project specific debt; government funding; and/or other financing or strategic opportunities. The Company has engaged RBC Capital Markets and Endeavour Financial to assist with the evaluation of potential strategic and financing opportunities and to support the Company’s application process in connection with the U.S. EXIM $1.8 billion Letter of Interest. Any such financing or strategic transaction, or any funding commitment from U.S. EXIM, will be subject to due diligence and other conditions. There can be no assurance of the amount, timing or nature of any such financing or strategic transaction, if any.
We believe our plans outlined above to obtain sufficient funding will be successful, although there is no certainty that these plans will result in needed liquidity for a reasonable period of time. However, contributions due under the Settlement Agreement and our expectation of incurring other costs in the foreseeable future that are not eligible for DPA funding reimbursement and the need for additional funding to further support the development of our planned operations, raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. The future receipt of potential funding from equity or debt issuances, pursuit of additional government funding opportunities and/or other means cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within our control as of the date hereof.
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.
Our anticipated expenditures for fiscal year 2025 are approximately $65.9 million, of which approximately $10.0 million are expected to be funded from the reimbursements under the TIA and the remainder from cash on hand and other sources. These expenditures include an estimated $11.9 million to fund permitting of the Stibnite Gold Project, $16.2 million for general corporate purposes, project financing and administrative costs, $28.4 million for detailed engineering, design work and down payments on long lead time equipment, $8.0 million for field operations and approximately $1.5 million to advance ASAOC bridge phase planning and reporting on and monitoring the completed Phase 1 ASAOC work. These costs are subject to change due to cost over-runs, delays or other unbudgeted events, such as effects of inflation, elevated interest rates and the potential impact of tariffs on U.S. trading partners. Our long-term liquidity requirements will require project financing to fund the capital costs to develop the Project, which was estimated to be approximately $2,215 million as of the fourth quarter of 2024 according to the 2024 Financial Update. We anticipate making a construction decision for the Project in 2025. As such, our capital expenditures for 2025 may increase significantly to reflect the

commencement of construction. Any such expenditures would be subject to the timing and nature of project financing or any strategic transaction that may be executed in 2025.
Critical Accounting Estimates 
We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our consolidated financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the judgements or assumptions involved and/or the magnitude of the asset, liability, or expense being reported.
Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration Costs
Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Acquisition costs include cash consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of mineral property claims.
Costs related to the development of our mineral reserves are capitalized when it has been determined an ore body can be economically developed. The development stage begins when an ore body is determined to be economically recoverable based on Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves and ends when the production stage or exploitation of reserves begins. Major mine development expenditures are capitalized, including primary development costs such as costs of building access ways, tailings impoundment, development of water supply and infrastructure developments.
Exploration costs include those relating to activities carried out (a) in search of previously unidentified mineral deposits, or (b) at undeveloped concessions. Pre-development activities involve costs incurred in the exploration stage that may ultimately benefit production that are expensed due to the lack of evidence of economic development, which is necessary to demonstrate future recoverability of these expenses. Secondary development costs are incurred for preparation of an ore body for production in a specific ore block or work area, providing a relatively short-lived benefit only to the mine area they relate to, and not to the ore body as a whole.
Once production has commenced, capitalized costs will be depleted using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in that period.
We assess the carrying cost of our mineral properties for impairment whenever information or circumstances indicate the potential for impairment. Such evaluations compare estimated future net cash flows with our carrying costs and future obligations on an undiscounted basis. If it is determined that the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, a write down to the estimated fair value is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period. Where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment, management assesses if the carrying value can be recovered.
For significant exploration and development projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 835-20. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on general debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depletion or impairment.

Table of Contents
Share-Based Compensation
We account for all share-based payments and awards under the fair value-based method.
We account for the granting of share purchase options and share awards using the fair value method whereby all awards to employees will be recorded at fair value on the date of the grant. The fair value of all share purchase options is expensed over their vesting period with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.
The fair value of share purchase options is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions including the length of time employees will retain their vested share purchase options before exercising them, expected stock price volatility, and interest rate.
The fair value of share-based awards that do not contain market conditions is based on the valuation of the common share on the date of grant. The fair value of time-based awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of performance-based awards is adjusted for the probability of achieving the performance conditions and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the award agreement.
The fair value of share-based awards with market conditions is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions and estimates utilized in the model include expected stock price volatilities and related indices, the interest rate, and the probability of awards expected to vest.
Changes in the input assumptions for options and share-based awards can materially affect the fair value estimate and the Company’s net loss.
Income Taxes
Our deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. We record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. We review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Perpetua Resources Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Perpetua Resources Corp. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Substantial Doubt About the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has had continuing net losses and net negative working capital that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Perpetua Resources Corp.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.
Nature of Operations and Going Concern Assessment
Perpetua Resources Corp. (the “Corporation”, and, together with its Subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Perpetua Resources” or “Perpetua”) was incorporated on February 22, 2011 under the Business Corporation Act of British Columbia. The Corporation was organized to hold shares in wholly owned subsidiaries that locate, acquire, develop and restore mineral properties located principally in the Stibnite – Yellow Pine mining district in Valley County, Idaho, USA. The Corporation’s principal asset is 
100
% ownership in subsidiaries that control the Stibnite Gold Project (“Stibnite Gold Project” or the “Project”). The Company currently operates in 
one
 segment, mineral exploration in the United States.
The Corporation has had continuing net losses and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $
595.2
 million as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $
44.1
 million and net working capital of approximately $
40.6
 million.
The Company’s latest liquidity forecast indicates that available cash resources for expenses not eligible for reimbursement under the modified Technology Investment Agreement (“TIA”) awarded pursuant to Title III of the Defense Production Act (“DPA”) are expected to be exhausted in the third quarter of 2025. Absent additional financing, the Company would no longer be able to meet its ongoing obligations or advance construction readiness activities. The Company continues to explore various strategic and funding opportunities, which may include the issuance of additional equity, new debt, or project specific debt; government funding; and/or other financing or strategic opportunities. The Company has engaged RBC Capital Markets and Endeavour Financial to assist with the evaluation of potential strategic and financing opportunities and to support the Company’s application process in connection with the U.S. EXIM $
1.8
 billion Letter of Interest received in April 2024. Any such financing or strategic transaction, or any funding commitment from U.S. EXIM, will be subject to due diligence and other conditions. There can be no assurance of the amount, timing or nature of any such financing or strategic transaction, if any.
We believe our plans outlined above to obtain sufficient funding will be successful although there is no certainty that these plans will result in needed liquidity for a reasonable period of time. However, contributions due under the Settlement Agreement and our expectation of incurring other costs in the foreseeable future that are not eligible for DPA funding reimbursement and the need for additional funding to further support the development of our planned operations, raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. The future receipt of potential funding from equity, debt, pursuit of additional government funding opportunities and/or other means cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within our control as of the date hereof.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.
​

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a
.
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
b.
Basis of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the results of Perpetua Resources and its wholly owned subsidiary companies Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. and Idaho Gold Resource Company, LLC. All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses have been eliminated.
F-7

Table of Contents
c.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuations and share-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
d.
Functional and Reporting Currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The functional and reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar (“USD” or “$”). All amounts in these consolidated financial statements are in USD, unless otherwise stated.
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the period end foreign exchange rate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate. All gains and losses on translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
e
.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments readily convertible to a known amount of cash with an original maturity of three months or less and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.
f.
Buildings and Equipment
Buildings and equipment are recorded at cost less depreciation and depletion and accumulated impairment losses, if any. We capitalize expenditures for improvements that significantly extend the useful life of an asset. We charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to operations when incurred. When an asset is sold, we recognize a gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based upon the proceeds received on the sale less the net carrying value of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labor and an appropriate portion of normal overhead. Portions of interest costs incurred on debt is capitalized as a part of the cost of constructing or acquiring certain qualifying assets.
The Company depreciates its assets, less their estimated residual values, as follows:
​
​
​
​
​
​
Category

Method

Useful life
Equipment and Vehicles

Straight-line

3
 to 
7 years
Building Leasehold Improvements

Straight-line

5
 to 
8 years
​
Buildings and equipment held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of buildings and equipment, the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows related to the assets or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets or asset group.
F-8

g.
Mineral Properties and Interest
Perpetua Resources is in the development stage based on the Company’s Probable Mineral Reserves as set forth in the Technical Report Summary, dated as of December 31, 2021, and amended as of June 6, 2022 (the “TRS”). Mineral properties and interest acquisition costs, including indirectly related acquisition costs, are capitalized when incurred. Properties acquired under option agreements, whereby payments are made at the sole discretion of the Company, are capitalized as mineral properties and interest acquisition costs at such time as the payments are made. Exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
When it is determined that a mining deposit can be economically and legally extracted or produced based on established Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves under Regulation S-K subpart 1300 (“S-K 1300”) promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), development costs related to such reserves and incurred after such determination will be considered for capitalization. The establishment of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves is based on results of feasibility studies, which indicate whether a property is economically feasible. Upon commencement of commercial production, capitalized costs will be amortized over their estimated useful lives or units of production, whichever is a more reliable measure. Capitalized amounts relating to a property that is abandoned or otherwise considered uneconomic for the foreseeable future are written off.
We review and evaluate the net carrying value of mineral properties and interest for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. This would include events and circumstances such as our inability to obtain all the necessary permits, changes in the legal status of our mineral properties, government actions, the results of exploration activities and technical evaluations and changes in economic conditions, including the price of commodities or input prices. Such evaluations compare estimated future net cash flows with our carrying costs and future obligations on an undiscounted basis.
If it is determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, an impairment loss will be recorded. Where estimates of future net cash flows are not determinable and where other conditions indicate the potential for impairment, management uses available market information and/or third-party valuation experts to assess if the carrying value can be recovered and to estimate fair value.
The recoverability of the carrying values of mineral properties and interest is dependent upon economic reserves being discovered or developed on the properties, permitting, financing, start-up, and commercial production from, or the sale/lease of, or other strategic transactions related to these properties. Development and/or start-up of a project will depend on, among other things, management’s ability to raise sufficient capital for these purposes.
h.
Leases
Upon inception, we determine if a contractual arrangement is, or contains, a lease. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities related to operating leases are separately reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently has 
no
 financing leases.
ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. When the rate implicit to the lease cannot be readily determined, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of the future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date and represents the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities also include any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent when the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term. The ROU assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the ROU asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the ROU asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred.
i.
Share Based Compensation
The Company uses its common shares for various forms of share-based compensation arrangements entered into with directors, officers, employees and consultants. Share-based compensation arrangements are accounted for at fair value on the date of grant. For awards with graded vesting, the fair value of each tranche is measured separately and recognized over its respective vesting period. The total amount recognized as expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options which ultimately vest. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
F-9

Table of Contents
The fair value of share purchase options is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions including the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, expected stock price volatility, and interest rate. Changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the Company’s net loss.
The fair value of share-based awards that do not contain market conditions is based on the valuation of the common share on the date of grant. The fair value of time-based awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of performance-based awards is adjusted for the probability of achieving the performance conditions and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the award agreement.
The fair value of share-based awards with market conditions is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions and estimates utilized in the model include expected stock price volatilities and related indices, the interest rate, and the probability of awards expected to vest.
j.
Reclamation and Remediation Costs and Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company is subject to various government laws and regulations relating to environmental disturbances caused by exploration, development and production activities. The estimated costs associated with environmental reclamation liabilities are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred if it is reasonably estimable or known. Future reclamation and environmental-related expenditures are difficult to estimate in many circumstances due to the early-stage nature of Company’s operations, the uncertainties associated with defining the nature and extent of environmental disturbance, the application of laws and regulations by regulatory authorities and changes in reclamation or remediation technology. The Company periodically reviews accrued liabilities for such reclamation and remediation costs as evidence indicating that the liabilities have potentially changed becomes available. Changes in estimates are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period an estimate is revised. 
The Company recognizes asset retirement obligations for statutory, contractual, or legal obligations associated with buildings and equipment and mineral interests and properties when those obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of the assets. The Company records a liability for the present value of estimated reclamation costs, and the related asset created with it, in the period in which the liability is incurred. The liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the life of the related assets. Adjustments for changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation are made in the period incurred. Discount rates using a pre-tax rate that reflect the time value of money are used to calculate the net present value of such costs. The Company’s estimates of reclamation costs could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, discount rates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of the future expenditures. The Company has 
no
 asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
k.
Fair Value Measurements
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the party’s own credit risk.
Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories:
●
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
●
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has 
no
 assets and 
no
 liabilities that are remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis.
F-10

l.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Under this method deferred income tax liabilities or assets are recorded for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, if any. Federal, state and foreign tax benefits are recorded as a reduction of income taxes, when applicable.
A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company is more likely than not that the asset will be recognized. We evaluate available positive and negative evidence available to determine the amount of valuation allowance required on our deferred tax assets.
We evaluate uncertain tax positions in a two-step process, whereby (i) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority would be recognized.
m.
Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares for the assumed exercise of share purchase options and vesting and distribution of awarded share units, if dilutive. The Company’s potential dilutive shares include outstanding share purchase options, restricted share units, performance share units, and deferred share units. Potentially dilutive shares as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

​

​
All potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their exercise and conversion would be anti-dilutive.
n.
Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and the environmental reclamation bond. The fair values of these instruments approximate their carrying value given their short-term nature unless otherwise noted.
o.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The financial instrument which potentially subjects the Company to credit risk is cash and cash equivalents. The Corporation holds most of its cash with Canadian chartered banks and the risk of default is considered to be remote. As part of its cash management process, the Company regularly monitors the relative credit standing of these institutions.
p.
Grant Income
From time to time, the Company may be awarded government grants. U.S. GAAP does not have specific accounting standards covering government grants to business entities. The Company applies International Accounting Standards 20 (“IAS 20”), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance by analogy when accounting for government grants. Under IAS 20, government grants are initially recognized when there is reasonable assurance the conditions of the grant will be met and the grant will be received. After initial recognition, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis in a manner that mirrors the manner in which the Company recognizes the underlying costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. A grant receivable is recognized if it compensates for expenses or losses already incurred. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 832 Government Assistance.

Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are recognized as operating expenses when incurred and are classified as exploration costs. 
r.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, amending reportable segment disclosure requirements to include disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. Among the disclosure enhancements are new disclosures regarding significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, as well as other segment items bridging segment revenue to each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and are applied retrospectively. The adoption of this update as of December 31, 2024 had minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosure. See Note 11 Segment Reporting.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures, amending income tax disclosure requirements for the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and are applied prospectively. Early adoption and retrospective application of the amendments are permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disclosure about the types of costs and expenses included in certain expense captions presented on the income statement. The new disclosure requirements are effective for the Company’s annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards did not or will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Leases
During 2024, the Company had 
two
 lease agreements for building space in Donnelly and Boise, Idaho both of which have been determined to be operating leases. Both leases provide the option for the Company to extend leases for additional time periods of 
one
 and 
two years
, respectively, which was not recognized as part of the right to use assets and lease liabilities value. For measurement of the original lease liability and right of use asset, the Company assumed a discount rate of 
10.0
% based on the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate. The weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases as of December 31, 2024 was 
0.4
 years. At December 31, 2024, all remaining undiscounted lease payments of $
29,000
 will be paid in 2025.

Table of Contents
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, rent expense of $
247,936

, respectively, is included in exploration expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
​
5.
Mineral Properties and Interest
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s mineral properties and interest at the Stibnite Gold Project totaled $
66,786,048
 and $
72,820,365
, respectively.
The Company’s subsidiaries acquired mineral rights to the Stibnite Gold Project through several transactions. All mineral and surface rights, where applicable, are held by the Company’s subsidiaries through patented and unpatented lode mining claims and mill sites, except the Cinnabar option claims which are held under an option to purchase, and all of the Stibnite Gold Project is subject to a 
1.7
% Net Smelter Returns (“NSR”) royalty upon the sale of project-related gold production.
On March 21, 2024, Perpetua Resources and its subsidiaries granted a 
100
% NSR royalty on the future payable silver production from the Project to Franco-Nevada Idaho Corporation (“Franco-Nevada”) for gross proceeds of $
8,500,000
. The silver royalty agreement applies to the same properties as the gold royalty previously purchased by Franco-Nevada in 2013. The silver royalty agreement provides a mechanism whereby Franco-Nevada can receive minimum payments equal to 
100
% of the payable silver from the sale of doré commencing in the seventh calendar year following commercial production and ending upon the completion of the fifteenth calendar year following commercial production. The silver royalty agreement also provides Franco-Nevada an option upon the occurrence of certain conditions precedent (including achieving commercial production) to pay the Company a contingent payment and receive a royalty on any silver payable from the production of antimony concentrate from the Project. The Company incurred costs of $
164,835
 associated with this transaction. The net proceeds of $
8,335,115
 were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the mineral properties and interests during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company’s obligations under the gold and silver royalty agreements with Franco-Nevada are secured by a continuing security interest and a first priority lien on certain collateral including the land and mineral interests comprising the Project.
Included in mineral properties and interest are annual payments made under option agreements, where the Company is entitled to continue to make annual option payments or, ultimately, purchase certain properties. On November 22, 2024, the Company exercised its option to purchase certain properties containing water rights which can be used for mitigation during operations and increased mineral properties by $
1,939,950
 related to this transaction. Annual payments made under other option agreements during 2024 were approximately $
30,000
.
As of December 31, 2024, it has not yet been determined that the Project’s mining deposits can be economically and legally extracted or produced because the Project’s estimated reserves do not yet meet the definition of proven reserves under S-K 1300.
Accordingly, development costs related to such reserves will not be capitalized unless they are incurred after such determination.

PSUs
: These PSUs vest upon completion of the performance period and specific performance conditions set forth for each individual grant for individually defined reporting and operating measurement objectives. T
he Company determines the factor to be applied to that target number of PSUs, with such percentage based on level of achievement of the performance conditions
. Upon the achievement of the conditions, any unvested PSUs become fully vested. Certain vesting provisions also apply in the event of the employee’s termination of employment by the Company without cause or a termination of employment due to the employee’s death, disability, or retirement if certain criteria are met. During the year ended December 31, 2024, PSUs awarded had a weighted average grant date fair value of $

MPSUs
: During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted MPSUs where vesting is based on the Company’s cumulative total shareholder return (“TSR”) as compared to the constituents that comprise the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (“GDXJ Index”) a group of similar junior gold mining companies, over a 
three year
 period (the “Performance Period”). The ultimate number of MPSUs that vest may range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the original target number of shares depending on the relative achievement of the TSR performance measure at the end of the Performance Period. Because the number of MPSUs that are earned will be based on the Company’s TSR over the Performance Period, the MPSUs are considered subject to a market condition. Compensation cost is recognized ratably over the Performance Period regardless as to whether the market condition is actually satisfied; however, the compensation cost will reverse if an employee terminates prior to satisfying the requisite service period.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company awarded 
389,502
 MPSUs (2023: 
277,535
 MPSUs) that had a weighted grant date fair value of $
5.00
 (2023: $
5.98
) per MPSU or approximately $
1.9
 million (2023: $
1.7
 million) in total. The grant date fair value of MPSUs was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions and estimates utilized in the model include expected volatilities of the Corporation’s stock price and the GDXJ Index, the Company’s risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The probabilities of the actual number of MPSUs expected to vest and resultant actual number of common shares expected to be awarded are reflected in the grant date fair values of the various MPSU awards. The per MPSU grant date fair value for the market condition was based on the following variables:

The expected volatility utilized is based on the historical volatilities of the Corporation’s common shares and the GDXJ Index in order to model the stock price movements. The volatility used was calculated over the most recent three year period. The risk-free interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bill with a term equivalent to the Performance Period. The expected dividend yield of 
zero
 was used since it is the mathematical equivalent to reinvesting dividends in each issuing entity over the Performance Period.

The Company records a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has determined that a full valuation allowance is necessary against its net deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available evidence. The resulting valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets of the Company is approximately $
83.6
 million and $
78.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, approximately $

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has U.S. loss carryforwards of approximately $
82.2
 million that expire in 2029 through 2037 and approximately $
93.7
 million with no expiration but which are subject to an 
80
% limitation upon utilization. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
128.5
 million that expire in 2031 through 2043 and Canadian loss carryforwards of approximately $
46.1
 million that expire in 2031 through 2044 available to reduce future years’ income for tax purposes. The deferred tax asset table above reflects the tax-effected balances of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards using a 
25.50
% rate for U.S.-based carryforwards and 
27.00
% rate for Canada-based carryforwards. Our utilization of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Code due to changes in control that may have occurred as a result of recent capital transactions.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company evaluated its tax positions for years which remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions and as a result concluded no adjustment was necessary. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and Canada federal jurisdictions, the state of Idaho jurisdiction, and the province of British Columbia jurisdiction. The Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in its income tax provision. U.S. tax returns for the years 2021 to 2023 and Canadian tax returns for the years 2020 to 2023 remain subject to examination but there are currently no ongoing exams in any taxing jurisdictions. Tax returns for years prior to 2021 may remain open with respect to net operating loss carryforwards that are utilized in a later year, as tax attributes from prior years can be adjusted during an audit of a later year.

Environmental Reclamation Liabilities
On January 15, 2021, the Company agreed to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“ASAOC”). The Company has accounted for its obligation under the ASAOC as an environmental reclamation liability. The provision for the liability associated with the terms of the ASAOC is based on cost estimates developed with the use of engineering consultants, independent contractor quotes and the Company’s internal development team. The timing of cash flows is based on the latest schedule for early action items. The estimated environmental reclamation liability may be subject to change based on changes to cost estimates and is adjusted for actual work performed. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company spent $
2.3
 million (2023: $
10.9
 million) on ASAOC activities. At December 31, 2024, 
no
 further costs were accrued associated with this liability. Movements in the environmental reclamation liability during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

Stibnite Foundation
Upon formation of the Stibnite Foundation on February 26, 2019, the Company became contractually liable for certain future payments to the Stibnite Foundation based on several triggering events, including receipt of a final Record of Decision (“ROD”) issued by the USFS, receipt of all permits and approvals necessary for commencement of construction, commercial production, and of the final reclamation phase. These payments will begin in the first quarter of 2025 based on the current permitting schedule and range from $
0.1
 million (upon receipt of the ROD) to $
1
 million (upon commencement of final reclamation phase) in cash and 
150,000
 common shares of the Company. During commercial production, the Company will make payments to the Stibnite Foundation equal to 
1
% of Total Comprehensive Income less debt repayments, or a minimum of $
0.5
 million each year.
The Stibnite Foundation will support projects that benefit the communities surrounding the Stibnite Gold Project and was created through the establishment of the Community Agreement between Perpetua Resources Idaho, Inc. and 
eight
 communities and counties throughout the West Central Mountains region of Idaho.

Legal Update
The Corporation and its subsidiaries have been parties to an ongoing legal proceeding with the Nez Perce Tribe for claimed violations of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) allegedly linked to historical mining activities. In August 2019, the Nez Perce Tribe filed suit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho. The Company filed an answer generally denying liability and later, the court allowed the Company to amend and file a third-party complaint against the Forest Service. The Company also filed a separate CWA citizen suit against the Forest Service alleging that several of the point source discharges, as alleged by the Nez Perce Tribe in its complaint, were occurring on lands owned and controlled by the United States government. Pursuant to the terms of the voluntary ASAOC executed in January 2021 with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) and the United States Department of Agriculture, the Company agreed to dismiss its pending actions against the Forest Service without prejudice. 
On August 8, 2023, the Company and the Nez Perce Tribe filed a final Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) to resolve the Tribe’s CWA litigation. The parties jointly asked the court to approve the Settlement Agreement and dismiss the case without prejudice. The Settlement Agreement provides for total payments of $
5
 million by Perpetua over a 
four-year
 period. This includes $
4
 million of contributions by Perpetua to a South Fork Salmon Water Quality Enhancement Fund (the “Fund”) to be used by the Nez Perce Tribe to support water quality improvement projects in the South Fork Salmon River watershed and $
1
 million of reimbursements to the Nez Perce Tribe for legal expenses. Following a 
45-day
 review period by the United States Justice Department and the U.S. EPA, the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho approved the Stipulation for Dismissal and entered a Judgment on October 2, 2023 which resulted in the CWA lawsuit being dismissed without prejudice. Under the Settlement Agreement, a dismissal with prejudice is contemplated after completion of Perpetua’s required payments. Once Perpetua has satisfied its payment obligations under the Settlement Agreement, the Company anticipates that the parties will submit a stipulation for dismissal with prejudice to the District Court. The Company recognized an expense of $
5
 million during the second quarter of 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid $
2,000,000
 on this settlement obligation. As of December 31, 2024, CWA settlement payable current portion is $
1,000,000
 with the remaining $
2,000,000
 classified as long-term.

The voluntary CERCLA ASAOC entered into by the Company, the U.S. EPA, and the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) required numerous early cleanup actions (referenced as “Phase 1” in the ASAOC) at the Stibnite Gold Project site (the “Stibnite Site”). The Company began the Phase 1 activities in 2022. As of December 31, 2024, the Company determined it had completed all Phase 1 response actions required by the ASAOC and filed necessary reports with the U.S. EPA and USDA with respect to such completion. Pursuant to the terms of the ASAOC, the two federal agencies are reviewing the reports submitted by the Company to ascertain whether they agree that the required Phase 1 activities are complete. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company spent $
2.3
 million on ASAOC activities (2023: $
10.9
 million). At December 31, 2024, no further costs were accrued associated with this Phase 1 liability. The ASAOC includes a process under which the Company and the signatory federal agencies will evaluate whether the Company will proceed with additional response actions after federal agencies confirm that the Phase 1 work has been completed in accordance with the ASAOC requirements. The scope of any such potential additional actions and their costs have not yet been determined.
Following the USFS’ publication of the ROD and FEIS authorizing the mine plan for the Project, claims were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho against the USFS and other federal agencies on February 18, 2025 by a number of claimants, including Save the South Fork Salmon and the Idaho Conservation League, alleging violations of NEPA and other federal laws in the regulatory review process. Among other remedies, the claimants seek to vacate the ROD, FEIS, Final Biological Opinions, and Project approvals and to enjoin any further implementation of the Project. PRII has filed a motion with the court to intervene in this lawsuit. The Company believes the federal regulatory process was conducted thoroughly and completely by the relevant federal regulatory agencies. However, there can be no assurance that the permits and Project approvals will be upheld upon judicial review.

Government Grants
The Company has been awarded government grants by the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) as described below. Accounting for these DOD grants does not fall under Accounting Standard Codification 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, as the DOD does not meet the definition of a customer under this standard. The DOD grant proceeds, which will be used to reimburse expenses incurred, meet the definition of grants related to expenses as the primary purpose for the payments is to fund research and development on antimony trisulfide and the advancement of the Company’s Stibnite Gold Project. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, grant income, which is included within other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, included the following:

The funding objective of the TIA is to complete environmental and engineering studies necessary to obtain a Final Environmental Impact Statement, a ROD, and other ancillary permits to sustain the domestic production of antimony trisulfide capability for defense energetic materials at the Stibnite Gold Project. Proceeds from the grant will be used primarily to reimburse the Company for certain costs incurred through June 16, 2025 related to environmental baseline data monitoring, environmental and technical studies and other activities related to advancing the Company’s construction readiness and the permitting process for the Stibnite Gold Project. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was reimbursed approximately $

15.5
 million under the Prototype Other Transaction Authority of the DOD through the DOTC. The funding objective of the OTIA is to demonstrate a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain using ore from the Stibnite Gold Project site. The OTIA designates funding to the Company to conduct activities to meet this objective, including obtaining additional core samples from the Project site, conducting a pilot plant study to produce mil-spec antimony trisulfide from the samples, designing a full-scale process circuit, and delivering a modular pilot plant for the DOD to use in further investigations. Under the OTIA, the Company will be reimbursed for these activities on a cost-plus fixed fee basis over the 
24-month
 period of performance. The current estimated amount is $
15.5
 million, which is subject to adjustment by the DOD based on scope, costs, budget, or other factors as the program advances. Perpetua will be entitled to reimbursement for all costs incurred under the agreement, with the negotiated fee being 
12
%. The OTIA contains customary terms and conditions for OTIAs, including ongoing reporting obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company received cash from this grant of $

 (2023: $
3,455,934
) for reimbursement of certain costs incurred of $
4,941,834
 (2023: $
3,085,656
) and 
12

 (2023 $
370,278
). During the year ended December 31, 2024, grant income includes $

 (2023: $
573,394
) of 
12
% fee income earned on costs incurred.

Segment Reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer, for the purpose of allocating an enterprise’s resources and assessing its operating performance. The Company has determined that it operates as a single reportable segment, focused on the exploration of its mineral interests in the state of Idaho, United States. This determination is based on the financial information reviewed by the CODM, which is assessed at a consolidated level.
The CODM is responsible for evaluating performance, allocating resources, and making strategic decisions. The primary measure used to assess the Company’s profitability is consolidated net loss, which is used to compare budgeted versus actual results and informs operating cash flow decisions on a monthly basis. The financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company’s single reportable segment align with the consolidated financial statements presented herein. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total assets.
The CEO primarily evaluates the Company’s performance based on consolidated net loss and reviews significant expenses, when applicable, on a consolidated basis, consistent with the presentation in the consolidated statements of operations. While the CEO’s primary focus is on overall consolidated results, he also reviews supplemental information on exploration costs by major category. The following table presents the Company’s exploration costs by major category:
