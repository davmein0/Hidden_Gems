Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
Our Company
We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to redefining the retina experience. AXPAXLI (axitinib intravitreal hydrogel, also known as OTX-TKI), our product candidate for retinal disease, is based on our proprietary ELUTYX bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology. AXPAXLI is currently in two repeat-dosing Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which we refer to as the SOL-1 and the SOL-R trials. We have also completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of AXPAXLI for the treatment of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or NPDR, which we refer to as the HELIOS trial. We intend to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first half of 2025 to discuss the design of a potential registrational clinical program for AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and diabetic macular edema, or DME, and then evaluate our next steps.
We also leverage the ELUTYX technology in our commercial product DEXTENZA, an FDA-approved corticosteroid for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, and our product candidate PAXTRAVA (travoprost intracameral hydrogel also known as OTX-TIC), which is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, or OAG, or ocular hypertension, or OHT.
Key Business and Financial Developments
AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD
In December 2024, the SOL-1 trial, our first registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD, completed randomization of more than 300 evaluable treatment-naïve subjects with a diagnosis of wet AMD in the study eye.
On January 14, 2025, we announced that, as of January 10, 2025, we had enrolled 311 subjects across various stages of loading and randomization in the SOL-R trial, our repeat-dosing registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD.
On February 24, 2025, we received an agreement letter regarding a second modification of our Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement for our SOL-1 trial from the FDA that allows us to add a repeat dose of AXPAXLI at each of Week 52 and Week 76 for the AXPAXLI arm to generate the required safety data for subjects re-dosed with AXPAXLI through Week 104 to support long-term dosing. As of March 3, 2025, subject retention in the SOL-1 trial has been exceptional, and the vast majority of supplemental treatments, reviewed on a masked basis, have been in accordance with pre-specified criteria under the trial protocol. Because the inclusion of re-dosing requires all data to be masked until Week 52, we now expect topline results for SOL-1 to be available in the first quarter of 2026. The optimized design of the SOL-1 trial enhances the potential for a 6 - 12 month dosing label for AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD and also provides insights into the long-term durability of AXPAXLI.
We previously intended to randomize 825 subjects in the SOL-R trial. The inclusion of re-dosing in the SOL-1 trial and the exceptional subject retention to date in the SOl-1 trial allow us to reduce the SOL-R trial size to 555 subjects.

AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and DME
We have completed the HELIOS trial of AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR. We intend to meet with the FDA in the first half of 2025 to discuss the design of a potential registrational clinical program for AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and DME and then evaluate our next steps.
Commercial
Our net product revenue is generated from the sale of DEXTENZA to specialty distributors, or SDs, for resale to certain ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs, certain hospital outpatient departments, or HOPDs, and certain physicians’ offices, and from the direct sale by us to ASCs and physicians’ offices. Our net product revenue was $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $5.6 million or 9.7% over the year ended December 31, 2023.
Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. par. 1395 et seq., or the Medicare Statute, physician administered non-opioid pain medications will receive separate payment in both the ASC and HOPD settings of care effective as of January 1, 2025. The Medicare Statute allows for continued separate payment of DEXTENZA in the ASC setting for 2025, and it re-establishes the separate payment of DEXTENZA in the HOPD setting that was lost for 2024. Additionally, the Medicare Statute limits the separate payment for physician administered non-opioid pain medications. In November 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the final Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, for the calendar year 2025, which results in a marginal decrease in physician payments for DEXTENZA. Effective January 2025, a clinician’s cost for DEXTENZA is included in the cost performance category of CMS’ Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS. For eligible clinicians, CMS calculates the MIPS final score based on four performance categories, which is then used by CMS to determine the payment adjustment applied to the clinicians’ Medicare Part B claims, with clinicians that incur costs above or below national average spending being penalized or incentivized, respectively.
We believe that DEXTENZA is currently used in less than 5% of cataract procedures and that commercial growth may be driven by a continued focus on sales to ASCs, specifically corporate accounts that own and control multiple ASCs and HOPDs.
In June 2024, we submitted the data for our clinical trial to evaluate DEXTENZA in pediatric subjects following cataract surgery to the FDA to fulfill a post-approval requirement of the FDA in connection with the FDA’s prior approval of DEXTENZA for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery in adults. We anticipate receiving the FDA’s decision on the pediatric labeling for DEXTENZA during the second quarter of 2025. 
Reduction in Force
In May 2024, our board of directors approved a strategic reduction in force to eliminate 37 full-time employees, primarily in research and development and technical operations and representing approximately 13% of our workforce, as part of an initiative to prioritize our resources on the clinical development of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD, or the Strategic Restructuring. We completed the Strategic Restructuring, recorded the related restructuring charges of $1.6 million, resulting primarily from garden leaves and severance benefits, and paid all previously accrued restructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2024.
2024 Private Placement
In February 2024, we sold in a private placement 32,413,560 shares of our common stock at $7.52 per share and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,805,957 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.519 per pre-funded warrant for total net proceeds to us of approximately $316.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, or the 2024 Private Placement. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, is currently exercisable and will remain exercisable until exercised in full.

Convertible Notes
In March 2024, the holder of our $37.5 million unsecured senior subordinated convertible notes, or the Convertible Notes, converted the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, and we issued to the holder of the Convertible Notes 5,769,232 shares of our common stock with a total fair value of $52.5 million and paid $11.4 million for accrued interest. The accounting for the extinguishment of the Convertible Notes resulted in a non-cash loss of $28.0 million.
Components of our Financial Performance
Revenue 
We recognize product revenue when we sell DEXTENZA in the United States to a network of SDs who then resell the product to ASCs, HOPDs, and physicians’ offices, and when we sell DEXTENZA on a direct basis to a small number of ASCs and physicians’ offices. We record DEXTENZA product sales net of estimated chargebacks, rebates, distribution fees and product returns. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions.
Operating Expenses 
Cost of Product Revenue 
Cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of DEXTENZA product revenue, which include:
●
Direct materials costs;
●
Royalties; 
●
Direct labor, which includes employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and payroll taxes,  and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in the production process; 
●
Manufacturing overhead costs, which includes rent, depreciation, and indirect labor costs associated with the production process;
●
Transportation costs; and
●
Cost of scrap material.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:
●
expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, including with the investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; 
●
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and payroll taxes, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development, clinical and regulatory and other related functions; 
●
expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to the FDA for our submissions for product approvals; 
●
expenses associated with developing our pre-commercial manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials; 
109

Table of Contents
●
ongoing research and development activities relating to our core bioresorbable hydrogel technology and improvements to this technology; 
●
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; 
●
costs relating to the supply and manufacturing of product inventory, prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products; and 
●
expenses associated with preclinical development activities.  
We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites.
Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical trials and regulatory fees.  We do not allocate employee and contractor-related costs, costs associated with our proprietary bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology ELUTYX, costs related to manufacturing or purchasing clinical trial materials, and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified.  We use internal resources in combination with third-party CROs, including clinical monitors and clinical research associates, to manage our clinical trials, monitor subject enrollment and perform data analysis for many of our clinical trials.  These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program.  
The successful development and commercialization of our products or product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:
●
the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;
●
the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals;
●
the efficacy and potential advantages of our products or product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care;
●
the market acceptance of our products or product candidates; and
●
significant and changing government regulation.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate.  We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in the future as we support our continued development of our product candidates.
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in selling and marketing functions as well as consulting, advertising and promotion costs.
110

Table of Contents
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, information technology, human resources and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include insurance, facility-related costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting and accounting and audit services.
Other Income (Expense) 
Interest Expense
.  Interest expense is incurred on our debt. In August 2023, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Barings Credit Agreement, with Barings Finance LLC, or Barings, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, providing for a secured term loan facility, or the Barings Credit Facility, in the aggregate principal amount of $82.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our interest-bearing debt included the Barings Credit Facility ($82.5 million outstanding principal) and the Convertible Notes (through March 28, 2024, no outstanding principal thereafter). For the year ended December 31, 2023, our interest-bearing debt included the Barings Credit Facility (from August 2, 2023), the Convertible Notes, and our obligations under a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust, as administrative agent, and other lenders that we entered into in 2014, or, as amended, the MidCap Credit Agreement, establishing a credit facility, or the MidCap Credit Facility ($25.0 million outstanding principal through August 2, 2023, no outstanding principal thereafter).
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities. 
In August 2023, in connection with entering into the Barings Credit Agreement, we identified an embedded derivative liability, or the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, which we are required to measure at fair value at inception and then at the end of each reporting period until the embedded derivative is settled. In 2019, in connection with the issuance of our Convertible Notes, we identified an embedded derivative liability, or the Conversion Option Derivative Liability, which we are required to measure at fair value at inception and then at the end of each reporting period until the embedded derivative is settled. The settlement of the Conversion Option Derivative Liability occurred on March 28, 2024. The changes in fair value of these derivative liabilities are recorded through the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and are presented under the caption “change in fair value of derivative liabilities”. 
Gains and Losses from Debt Extinguishment
. In March 2024, the holder of the Convertible Notes converted the Convertible Notes. In connection with the conversion, our obligations under the Convertible Notes extinguished, resulting in a non-cash loss on extinguishment. In August 2023, we amended the Convertible Notes and accounted for the amendment, or the Convertible Notes Amendment, as an extinguishment of debt in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 470-50 
Debt
. Application of this accounting standard resulted in a non-cash gain on extinguishment. In August 2023, we also extinguished our obligations under the MidCap Credit Facility, resulting in a non-cash loss on extinguishment.

Product Revenue, net
Our product revenue, net was $63.5 million and $57.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of $5.6 million year-over-year. All of our product revenue, net, was attributable to sales of DEXTENZA.
Our total gross-to-net provisions, or GTN Provisions, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 38.5% and 30.1%, respectively, of gross DEXTENZA product sales. We increased the wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, for DEXTENZA effective April 2024 and again effective October 2024. Concurrently with the increases of the WAC, and additionally at other points in time in 2024, we also increased the off-invoice discount, or OID, for DEXTENZA as part of our overall pricing strategy. The OID amounts are generally determined at the time of resale by SDs or direct sales to ASCs or physicians’ offices by us. The GTN Provisions relative to gross DEXTENZA product sales increased as a result of the changes in the OID and are expected to increase with any additional anticipated OID increases, and we expect that GTN Provisions relative to gross DEXTENZA product sales will remain at this increased level, or might increase further, for 2025 and beyond.
Collaboration Revenue
We recognized $0.3 million of collaboration revenue related to the performance obligation under our license agreement with AffaMed to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. We recognize collaboration revenue based on a cost-to-cost method.

Research and development expenses were $127.6 million and $61.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of $66.6 million year-over-year.
Within research and development expenses, direct expenses for clinical programs increased $46.3 million, unallocated expenses increased $20.9 million, and expenses for preclinical programs decreased $0.6 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $65.6 million in direct research and development expenses for our products and product candidates compared to $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $45.7 million is related to timing and conduct of our various clinical trials for our product candidates, including the progression of the SOL-1 trial, which was fully randomized by December 2024, the initiation of the SOL-R trial, the completion of the HELIOS trial, and development activities related to our preclinical programs.
113

Table of Contents
We expect that direct research and development expenses for our products and product candidates will increase significantly for 2025 as we progress with the SOL-1 and the SOL-R trials; complete our other ongoing clinical trials; and initiate any other clinical trials of our product candidates that we might determine in the future to conduct, partially offset by reduced costs related to preclinical programs as a result of the Strategic Restructuring. We expect that personnel costs will increase for 2025 and beyond, as we have strengthened in 2024, and may continue to further strengthen in 2025, our clinical leadership team and our clinical teams dedicated to the SOL-1 and SOL-R trials, with the addition of several retinal disease experts and other key professionals. The anticipated increase will be partially offset by reduced personnel costs as a result of the Strategic Restructuring. We do not anticipate to incur significant research and development costs for our former product candidates OTX-DED and OTX-CSI in 2025 and beyond.

Selling and marketing expenses were $41.6 million and $40.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of $1.0 million year-over-year.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.6 million in professional fees, an increase in facility-related and other costs of $0.3 million, and an increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, of $0.1 million. 
We expect our selling and marketing expenses to remain stable or increase slightly for 2025 as we continue to support the commercialization of DEXTENZA.

General and administrative expenses were $60.7 million and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of $26.7 million year-over-year.
The increase was primarily due to an increase of $18.9 million in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation, an increase in professional fees of $4.7 million and an increase of $3.0 million in facility related and other costs. Personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for the year ended December 31, 2024 include $1.6 million related to wages, severance, and other benefits under the Strategic Restructuring, and $9.3 million related to accrued severance and acceleration of stock-based compensation for certain former members of our senior leadership team who departed during the year ended December 31, 2024 separate from the Strategic Restructuring.
We anticipate that the level of our general and administrative expenses, exclusive of the one-time charges related to restructuring activities, will increase for 2025, as we have recently strengthened, and will continue to further

strengthen, our leadership team and other certain functions that support our clinical trials of AXPAXLI, including the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, and our business in general.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest Income
. Interest income was $20.3 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of $16.3 million year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to a higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents held by us, and higher interest rates.
Interest Expense
. Interest expense was $13.6 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting an increase of $2.2 million year-over-year. The increase is primarily due to higher average balances of debt outstanding as a result of us drawing $82.5 million of debt under the Barings Credit Facility in August 2023, partially offset by us paying off the MidCap Credit Facility, of $25.0 million in August 2023, and the conversion of the Convertible Notes of $37.5 million in March 2024, and higher interest rates.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities. 
We recognized a net loss from the change in fair values of our derivative liabilities of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net loss for 2024 comprises of a gain of $2.6 million from the change in the fair value of the Conversion Option Derivative Liability, a loss of $0.9 million from the change in the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, and an expense of $2.2 million related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Agreement that we paid or accrued. The net loss for 2023 comprises of a loss of $4.5 million from the change in the fair value of the Conversion Option Derivative Liability and $0.9 million related to royalty fees under the Barings Credit Agreement that we paid or accrued, partially offset by a gain of $0.2 million from the change in the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability.
Gains and Losses on Extinguishment of Debt, Net.
 We recognized a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a gain, net, on extinguishment of debt of $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 results from the conversion of the Convertible Notes in March 2024. The net gain for the year ended December 31, 2023 results from the accounting for the Convertible Notes Amendment, which resulted in a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $14.9 million, and for the extinguishment of our obligations under the MidCap Credit Agreement, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
A discussion of changes in our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2024, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference and which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings and private placements of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase our common stock, borrowings under credit facilities, the private placements of our convertible notes, and sales of our products.
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $392.1 million, and outstanding notes payable with a principal amount of $82.5 million par value under the Barings Credit Facility.
In February 2024, we sold 32,413,560 shares of our common stock at $7.52 per share and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 10,805,957 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.519 per pre-funded warrant for total net proceeds of approximately $316.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses, in the 2024 Private Placement. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, is currently exercisable and will remain exercisable until exercised in full.
115

Table of Contents
On December 18, 2023, we sold 35,420,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $3.25 per share. The total net proceeds of the public offering to us were approximately $107.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.
In August 2023, we entered into the Barings Credit Agreement with Barings as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, providing for the Barings Credit Facility in the aggregate principal amount of $82.5 million. We borrowed the full amount of $82.5 million at closing and received proceeds of $77.3 million, after the application of an original issue discount and fees.
In August 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement, or the 2021 Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million from time to time through Jefferies, acting as agent. We did not offer or sell shares of our common stock under the 2021 Sales Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 1,514,926 shares of common stock under the 2021 Sales Agreement, resulting in net proceeds to us, after accounting for issuance costs, of $9.5 million.
In connection with entering the Barings Credit Facility, in August 2023, we paid MidCap Financial Trust, as administrative agent, and our other lenders an aggregate of $26.2 million in satisfaction of our obligations under the MidCap Credit Facility.
Funding Requirements
We have a history of incurring significant operating losses. Our net losses were $193.5 million, $80.7 million, and $71.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $891.1 million.
We expect to continue to incur losses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical trials of our product candidates in development, including AXPAXLI, and increase our sales and marketing resources to support the commercialization of DEXTENZA and the potential launch of our product candidates, subject to receiving FDA approval.  
We anticipate we will incur substantial expenses if and as we: 
●
continue our ongoing clinical trials, including the SOL-1 and the SOL-R trials, our two registrational Phase 3 clinical trials of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD;
●
initiate any additional clinical trials we might determine in the future to conduct for our product candidates, including any clinical trials that we might conduct for AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and DME;
●
scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and expand our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel; 
●
scale up our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to prepare for commercialization of any product candidates for which we intend to obtain marketing approval;
●
seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;
●
continue to monitor subjects according to the applicable clinical trial protocols, or prepare submission documentation such as clinical study reports, for our clinical trials that have been completed;
●
continue to commercialize DEXTENZA in the United States;
●
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 
116

Table of Contents
●
expand our operational, quality assurance, financial, administrative and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts; 
●
defend ourselves against legal proceedings, if any;
●
make investments to improve our defenses against cybersecurity threats and establish and maintain cybersecurity insurance; 
●
increase our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and commercialization efforts; and 
●
continue to operate as a public company.
The amount and timing of these expenses determines our future capital requirements.
Based on our current operating plan, which includes estimates of anticipated cash inflows from DEXTENZA product sales and cash outflows from operating expenses and capital expenditures and reflects our observance of the minimum liquidity covenant of $20.0 million under the Barings Credit Agreement, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. 
Our planned operating expenses do not include the expenses necessary to conduct a clinical trial of AXPAXLI for NPDR and DME, or to build out our manufacturing capabilities beyond the buildout of our existing manufacturing facilities. 
We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
●
the progress, costs and outcome of our ongoing clinical trials of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD;
●
the timing, scope, progress, costs and outcome of a potential registrational clinical program of AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and DME;
●
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory authorities;
●
the scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and any additional clinical trials we might determine in the future to conduct for our other product candidates, including PAXTRAVA for the reduction of intraocular pressure, or IOP, in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, or OAG, or ocular hypertension, or OHT;
●
the level of product sales from DEXTENZA and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future and the level of third-party reimbursement of such products;
●
the costs of sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization efforts with respect to DEXTENZA and any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the future, including cost increases due to inflation; 
●
the costs of scaling up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI,  and of expanding our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel; 
●
the extent of our debt service obligations and our ability, if desired, to refinance any of our existing debt on terms that are more favorable to us;
●
the amounts we are entitled to receive, if any, as reimbursements for clinical trial expenditures, development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments, and royalty payments under our license agreement with AffaMed;
117

Table of Contents
●
the extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates; 
●
the costs and outcomes of any legal actions and proceedings;
●
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and 
●
the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, and marketing and distribution arrangements.  We do not have any committed external source of funds, although our license agreement with AffaMed provides for AffaMed’s reimbursement of certain clinical expenses incurred by us in connection with our collaboration and for our potential receipt of development and sales milestone payments and royalty payments.  To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, our securityholders’ ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing securityholders’ rights as holders or beneficial owners of our common stock.  Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.  The covenants under the Barings Credit Facility and our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under the Barings Credit Facility pursuant to which we have a total borrowing capacity of $82.5 million, which has been fully drawn down, may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or other financing. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, products or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

The table above includes our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at December 31, 2024, as well as obligations related to contracts that we are likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they may be cancelable at December 31, 2024. Some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, and other factors. Because 
119

Table of Contents
these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the amounts we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts which are not included in contractual obligations and commitments.
Operating lease commitments represent payments due under our leases of office, laboratory and manufacturing space in Bedford, Massachusetts that expire in July 2027 and July 2028, and leases of equipment that expire between 2026 and 2028.
The commitments under the Barings Credit Agreement represent repayment of principal only. Future payments of interest under the Barings Credit Agreement depends on the level of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, and future payments of royalty fees depend on our future revenue from DEXTENZA, both of which cannot be estimated at this time.
We have in-licensed a significant portion of our intellectual property from Incept, an intellectual property holding company, under an amended and restated license agreement, or the License Agreement, that we entered into with Incept in January 2012, which was most recently amended in September 2018. We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low-single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any products
, devices, materials, or components thereof, or the Licensed Products, including or covered by Original IP (as defined in the License Agreement), excluding the Shape-Changing IP (as defined in the License Agreement), in the Ophthalmic Field of Use (as defined in the License Agreement).  We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty 
equal to a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any Licensed Products including or covered by Original IP, excluding the Shape-Changing IP, in the Additional Field of Use (as defined in the License Agreement). We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low-single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates of any Licensed Products including or covered by Incept IP (as defined in the License Agreement) or Joint IP (as defined in the License Agreement) in the field of drug delivery. Any sublicensee of ours also will be obligated to pay Incept a royalty on net sales of Licensed Products made by it and will be bound by the terms of the agreement to the same extent as we are. We are obligated to reimburse Incept for our share of the reasonable fees and costs incurred by Incept in connection with the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to us under the agreement. Our share of these fees and costs is equal to the total amount of such fees and costs divided by the total number of Incept’s exclusive licensees of the patent application. We have not included in the table above any payments to Incept under this license agreement as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheets.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued research and development expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize product revenue from the sales of DEXTENZA product.
In November 2018, the FDA approved DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular pain following ophthalmic surgery. We entered into a limited number of arrangements with specialty distributors in the United States to distribute DEXTENZA. Accounting Standards Codification 606 – 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or Topic 606, applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance arrangements and financial instruments. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract with a customer under Topic 606, including when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. For a complete discussion of accounting for product revenue, see 
Product Revenue, Net
 (below).
Product Revenue, Net
— We derive our product revenues from the sale of DEXTENZA in the United States to customers, which includes a limited number of specialty distributors, who then subsequently resell DEXTENZA to ASCs, HOPDs, and physicians’ offices. We also sell DEXTENZA directly to a small population of ASCs and physicians’ offices, based on individually negotiated direct distribution agreements.  In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government mandated or privately negotiated rebates and chargebacks with respect to the purchase of DEXTENZA.
We recognize revenue on product sales when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time (upon delivery to the customer). We have determined that the delivery of DEXTENZA to our customers constitutes a single performance obligation.  There are no other promises to deliver goods or services beyond what is specified in each accepted customer order.  We have assessed the existence of a significant financing component in the agreements with our customers.  The trade payment terms with our customers do not exceed one year and therefore we have elected to apply the practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.  Product revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for variable consideration, including discounts and allowances.

Table of Contents
Transaction Price, including Variable Consideration
— Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established. Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, product returns, government chargebacks, discounts and rebates, and other incentives, such as voluntary patient assistance, and other fee-for-service amounts that are detailed within contracts between us and our customers relating to our sale of DEXTENZA. These reserves, as detailed below, are based on the amounts earned, or to be claimed on the related sales, and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable or a current liability. These estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted in accordance with the expected value method in Topic 606 for relevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the respective underlying contracts.
The amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price, only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our original estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
Trade Discounts and Allowances
—We compensate (through trade discounts and allowances) our customers for sales order management, data, and distribution services. However, we have determined such services received to date are not distinct from our sale of products to the customer and, therefore, these payments have been recorded as a reduction of revenue within the statement of operations and comprehensive loss, as well as a reduction to trade receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets.
Product Returns
— Consistent with industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return for product that has been purchased from us in certain circumstances as further discussed below. 
 We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, as well as within accrued expenses and other current liabilities, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  We currently estimate product return reserves using available industry data and our own sales information, including our visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel. We have received minimal returns to date and believe the returns of DEXTENZA will be minimal. 
Government Chargebacks
— Chargebacks for fees and discounts to qualified government healthcare providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified 
U.S.
 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and 340B entities at prices lower than the list prices charged to customers who directly purchase the product from us.
  The 340B Drug Discount Program is a U.S. federal government program created in 1992 that requires drug manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to eligible health care organizations and covered entities at significantly reduced prices. 
Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the statutory selling price to the qualified government entity. These allowances are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and trade receivables, net. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified government healthcare provider by customers, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the customer’s notification to us of the resale. Allowances for chargebacks consist of credits that we expect to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel inventories at each reporting period-end that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, and chargebacks that customers have claimed, but for which we have not yet issued a credit.
Government Rebates
— We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For Medicare, we also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. For Medicaid programs, we estimate the portion of sales attributed to Medicaid patients and record a liability for the rebates to be paid to the respective state Medicaid programs.  Our liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but which remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.

Purchaser/Provider Discounts and Rebates
—We offer rebate payments for which ASCs, HOPDs and other prescribers qualify by meeting quarterly purchase volumes of DEXTENZA under our volume-based rebate program. We calculate rebate payment amounts due under this program quarterly, based on actual qualifying purchases and apply a contractual discount rate.  In the third quarter of 2022, we implemented a separate off-invoice discount, or OID, rebate program
 whereby end-
users receive the discounted price immediately upon purchase, rather than having to wait until the end of the quarter for a rebate payment. The OID amounts are generally determined at the time of resale by specialty distributors, or SDs, or direct sales to ASCs by us. We generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the SD’s notification to us of the resale. We include the OID on the invoice when we sell to an ASC directly.   The calculation of the accrual for all rebates is based on an estimate of claims that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue but also remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. The adjustments are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability which is included as an accrued expenses and other current liabilities for volume-based rebates and as a reduction of accounts receivable for OID rebates.
Other Incentives
— Other incentives which we offer include voluntary patient assistance programs, such as the co-pay assistance program, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially-insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. The adjustments are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability which is included as accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Derivative Liabilities
The Barings Credit Agreement contains the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, an embedded obligation to pay the Royalty Fee, that meets the criteria to be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the Barings Credit Facility. Royalty payments are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The main inputs when determining the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability are the amount and timing of our expected future revenue, the estimated volatility of these revenues, and the discount rate corresponding to the risk of revenue. We measure the value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability at its estimated fair value and recognize changes in the estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change. The Royalty Fee Derivative Liability is recognized as a derivative liability in our consolidated balance sheet.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $392.1 million, which includes cash in operating bank accounts, and investments in money market funds. We have policies requiring us to invest in high-quality issuers, limit our exposure to any individual issuer, and ensure adequate liquidity. Our primary exposure to market risk related to our cash and cash equivalents is interest-rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term securities. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.
We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
As of December 31, 2024, we had a secured term loan facility with a principal amount of $82.5 million under a credit and security agreement with Barings Finance LLC and the lenders party thereto, or the Barings Credit Agreement. Expected cash outflows from this financial instrument fluctuate based on changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, which is, among other factors, affected by the general level of U.S. and international central bank 
123

Table of Contents
interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, an immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in the SOFR would not have a material effect on the anticipated cash outflows from this instrument.
We account for the obligation to pay royalty fees embedded in the Barings Credit Agreement as a separate financial instrument, measured at fair value, using a Monte Carlo simulation, which we refer to as the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability.  As of December 31, 2024, the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability was valued at $13.2 million. As of December 31, 2024, a 10% increase or decrease of the interest rate used in the valuation model would not have a material effect on the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability. Changes of the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability have no impact on anticipated cash outflows.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
●
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
●
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
124

Table of Contents
●
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
. Based on that assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B.
Other Information
A portion of the compensation of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) is in the form of equity awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, and, from time to time, directors and officers engage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities acquired pursuant to such equity awards or other of our securities, including to satisfy tax withholding obligations when equity awards vest or are exercised, and for diversification or other personal reasons.
Transactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in our securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, 
none
 of our 
directors
 and 
officers
 adopted or terminated a trading 
arrangement
 for the sale or purchase of our securities that is either (1) a contract, instruction or written plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c), or a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”, or (2) a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ocular Therapeutix, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
F-2

Table of Contents
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – DEXTENZA
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sells DEXTENZA in the United States primarily to a limited number of specialty distributors (SDs) under individually negotiated distribution agreements. These customers then subsequently resell DEXTENZA to ambulatory surgery centers, hospital outpatient departments and physicians’ offices. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales when the customer obtains control of the Company's product, which occurs at a point in time (upon delivery to the customer). Product revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for variable consideration, including discounts and allowances. As disclosed by management, the delivery of DEXTENZA to customers constitutes a single performance obligation. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $63.5 million of product revenue, net, relating to the sale of DEXTENZA. 
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for DEXTENZA is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to revenue recognition for DEXTENZA. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process for DEXTENZA, including controls over the recording of revenue for DEXTENZA at the transaction price when the customer obtains control. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating management’s revenue recognition policy; (ii) testing the, on a sample basis, completeness, accuracy, and occurrence of amounts invoiced for DEXTENZA by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as purchase orders, invoices, proof of delivery, and subsequent cash receipts; (iii) testing, on a sample basis, the accuracy of variable consideration applied related to the sale of DEXTENZA by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, units sold, rebate payments made and other related documentation; and (iv) confirming, on a sample basis, the accuracy and existence of outstanding accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2024 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as, purchase orders, invoices, proof of delivery, and subsequent cash receipts.

OCULAR THERAPEUTIX, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
1. Nature of the Business
Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on September 12, 2006 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company committed to redefining the retina experience. AXPAXLI (axitinib intravitreal hydrogel, also known as OTX-TKI), the Company’s product candidate for retinal disease, is based on its proprietary ELUTYX bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology. AXPAXLI is currently in two repeat-dosing Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (“wet AMD”), which the Company refers to as the SOL-1 and the SOL-R trials. The Company has also completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of AXPAXLI for the treatment of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (“NPDR”), which the Company refers to as the HELIOS trial and intends to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), in the first half of 2025 to discuss the design of a potential registrational clinical program for AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and diabetic macular edema (“DME”) and then evaluate its next steps.
The Company also leverages the ELUTYX technology in its commercial product DEXTENZA, an FDA-approved corticosteroid for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, and its product candidate PAXTRAVA (travoprost intracameral hydrogel also known as OTX-TIC), which is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma (“OAG”) or ocular hypertension (“OHT”). 
The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, dependence on specific programs, compliance with government regulations, regulatory approval and compliance, reimbursement, uncertainty of market acceptance of products and the need to obtain additional financing. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. Approved products will require significant sales, marketing and distribution support. There can be no assurance that the Company’s research and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company’s intellectual property will be obtained, that any products developed will obtain necessary government regulatory approval and adequate reimbursement or that any approved products will be commercially viable. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant revenue from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapidly changing technology and substantial competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the Company is dependent upon the services of its employees and consultants. The Company may not be able to generate significant revenue from sales of any product for several years, if at all. Accordingly, the Company will need to obtain additional capital to finance its operations.
The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception, and the Company expects to continue to generate operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
891,084
. Based on its current operating plan which includes estimates of anticipated cash inflows from product sales and cash outflows from operating expenses and capital expenditures, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $
392,102
 as of December 31, 2024 will enable it to fund its planned operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditures at least through the next 12 months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements while the Company observes a minimum liquidity covenant of $
20,000
 in its credit facility (Note 9).
The future viability of the Company is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate cash flows from the sales of the Company’s product candidates, such as AXPAXLI, if and as approved, and the sales of DEXTENZA, and to raise additional capital to finance its operations. The Company will need to finance its operations through public or private securities offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing agreements, royalty agreements, or marketing and distribution agreements. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, in sufficient amounts, or at all, the Company could be 
F-8

forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs for product candidates, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, any of which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the measurement and recognition of reserves for variable consideration related to product sales, revenue recognition related to a collaboration agreement that contains multiple promises, the fair value of derivatives, stock-based compensation, and realizability of net deferred tax assets. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, which primarily consist of investments in money market funds, are stated at fair value.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 – 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract, determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. 
Product Revenue
The Company sells DEXTENZA in the United States primarily to a limited number of specialty distributors (“SDs”) under individually negotiated distribution agreements. These customers then subsequently resell DEXTENZA to ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), hospital outpatient departments (“HOPDs”) and physicians’ offices. The Company also sells DEXTENZA directly to a small population of ASCs and physicians’ offices based on individually negotiated direct distribution agreements (the “Direct Customers”). In addition, the Company enters into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government mandated or privately negotiated rebates and chargebacks with respect to the purchase of DEXTENZA.

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales when the customer obtains control of the Company's product, which occurs at a point in time (upon delivery to the customer). Product revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for variable consideration, including discounts and allowances.
Transaction Price, including Variable Consideration
— Revenues from product sales are recorded net of off-invoice discounts and reserves which are established for our estimate of variable consideration. Components of variable consideration include trade discounts and allowances, product returns, government chargebacks, discounts and rebates, and other incentives, such as voluntary patient assistance, and other fee-for-service amounts that are detailed within contracts between the Company and its customers. These reserves, as detailed below, are based on the amounts earned, or to be claimed on the related sales, and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable or a current liability. These estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted in accordance with the expected value method in ASC 606 for relevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the respective underlying contracts.
The amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price, only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company’s original estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
Trade Discounts and Allowances
—The Company compensates (through trade discounts and allowances) its customers for sales order management, data, and distribution services. However, the Company has determined such services received to date are not distinct from the Company’s sale of products to the customer and, therefore, these payments have been recorded as a reduction of revenue within the statement of operations and comprehensive loss, as well as a reduction to accounts receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets.
Product Returns
— Consistent with industry practice, the Company generally offers customers a limited right of return for product that has been purchased from the Company based on the products expiration date. 
 The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by its customers and records this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, as well as within accrued expenses and other current liabilities, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The Company currently estimates product return reserves using available industry data and its own sales information, including its visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel. 
Government Chargebacks
— Chargebacks for fees and discounts to qualified government healthcare providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified 
U.S.
 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and entities that are subject to the 
U.S. federal government
 340B 
Drug Discount Program
 at prices lower than the list prices charged to SDs and Direct Customers.

Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified government healthcare provider by SDs and Direct Customers, and the Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the customer’s notification to the Company of the resale. Allowance for chargebacks also consist of credits that the Company expects to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel inventories at each reporting period-end that the Company expects will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, and chargebacks that customers have claimed, but for which the Company has not yet issued a credit. These allowances are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivables, net.
Government Rebates
— The Company is subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For Medicare, the Company also estimates the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom the Company will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. For Medicaid programs, the Company estimates the portion of sales attributed to Medicaid patients and records a liability for the rebates to be paid to the respective state Medicaid programs.  The Company’s liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet 
F-10

Table of Contents
been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but which remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.
Purchaser/Provider Discounts and Rebates
— The Company offers rebate payments for which ASCs, HOPDs and other prescribers qualify by meeting quarterly purchase volumes of DEXTENZA under the Company’s volume-based rebate program. The Company calculates rebate payment amounts due under this program quarterly, based on actual qualifying purchases and applies a contractual discount rate.  In the third quarter of 2022, the Company implemented a separate off-invoice discount (“OID”) rebate program
 whereby end-
users receive the discounted price immediately upon purchase, rather than having to wait until the end of the quarter for a rebate payment. The OID amounts are generally determined at the time of resale by SDs or direct sales to ASCs by the Company. The Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the SD’s notification to the Company of the resale. The Company includes the OID on the invoice when it sells to an ASC directly.  The calculation of the accrual for all rebates is based on an estimate of claims that the Company expects to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue but also remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. The adjustments are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability which is included as an accrued expenses and other current liabilities for volume-based rebates and as a reduction of accounts receivable for OID rebates.
Other Incentives
— Other incentives which the Company offers include voluntary patient assistance programs, such as the co-pay assistance program, which are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially-insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. The adjustments are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability which is included as an accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Collaboration Revenue 
The Company evaluates contracts that contain multiple promises to determine which promises are distinct. Promises are considered to be distinct and therefore, accounted for as separate performance obligations, provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and (ii) the promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. In assessing whether a promise is distinct, the Company considers factors such as whether: (i) the Company provides a significant service of integrating goods and/or services with other goods and/or services promised in the contract; (ii) one or more of the goods and/or services significantly modifies or customizes, or are significantly modified or customized by one or more of the other goods and/or services promised in the contract; and (iii) the goods and/or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated. Individual goods or services (or bundles of goods and/or services) that meet both criteria for being distinct are accounted for as separate performance obligations. Promises that are not distinct at contract inception are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation. Options to acquire additional goods and/or services are evaluated to determine if such option provides a material right to the customer that it would not have received without entering into the contract. If so, the option is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. If not, the option is considered a marketing offer which would be accounted for as a separate contract upon the customer’s election.
The Company considers the existence of any significant financing component within its arrangements based on whether a substantive business purpose exists to support the payment structure other than to provide a significant benefit of financing. The Company measures the transaction price based on the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods and/or services to the customer. The Company utilizes either the expected value method or the most likely amount method to estimate the amount of variable consideration, depending on which method is expected to better predict the amount of consideration to which the Company will be entitled. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. With respect to arrangements that include payments for a development or regulatory milestone payment, the Company evaluates whether the associated event is considered likely of achievement and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount 
F-11

Table of Contents
method. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s control or the control of the licensee, such as those dependent upon receipt of regulatory approval, are not considered to be likely of achievement until the triggering event occurs. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of each milestone and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment. For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based upon the achievement of a certain level of product sales, wherein the license is deemed to be the sole or predominant item to which the payments relate, the Company recognizes revenue upon the later of: (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the payment has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Consideration that would be received for optional goods and/or services is excluded from the transaction price at contract inception.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable arise from product sales and are recognized at the amounts invoiced to customers, net of applicable reserves for variable consideration. The Company analyzes the actual payment history of its customers, the aging of receivables, current customer-specific developments and economic trends to estimate the reserve for current expected credit losses.
Inventory
The Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs, which include amounts related to direct labor, materials and manufacturing overhead, are determined using standard costs, which approximate average cost. The Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and it writes down any excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified.  Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded within cost of product revenue. 
The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with the Company’s products after regulatory approval when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Inventory acquired prior to receipt of marketing approval of a product candidate is expensed as research and development expense as incurred. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial product is expensed as research and development expense when selected for use in a clinical manufacturing campaign.  Inventory produced that will be used in promotional marketing campaigns is expensed to selling and marketing expense when it is selected for use in a marketing program.
Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:
●
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2—Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices) such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
●
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.

Derivative Instruments
The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the estimated fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
If the Company determines that a financial or non-financial contract, a ‘host contract’, includes implicit or explicit terms that affect the cash flows of the contract in a manner similar to a stand-alone derivative instrument, an ‘embedded derivative’, the Company analyzes whether to account for the embedded derivative separately. The Company accounts for an embedded derivative not separately from the host contract if it is clearly and closely related to the host contract or if the entire contract is measured at fair value through profit or loss. In other cases, the Company accounts for an embedded derivative separately.
The Company measures the value of embedded derivatives that are accounted for separately at their respective fair values and recognizes changes in the respective estimated fair values in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change. Embedded derivatives that are accounted for separately are recognized as derivative liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method over a 
three
- to 
five-year
 estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance of assets are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from operations.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as operating lease assets, current portion of lease liabilities and long-term lease liabilities. Operating lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding operating lease assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. The operating lease assets also include any lease payments made and adjustments for prepayments and lease incentives. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilized its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company reassesses the lease term and remeasures the lease liability if triggering events occur. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and right-of-use assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. The Company has had no impairment triggers of long-lived assets.

Warrants
The Company accounts for issued warrants, including pre-funded warrants, as either liability or equity. Warrants are considered liabilities if they are mandatorily redeemable and they require settlement in cash or other assets, or a variable number of shares. Contracts that may require settlement for cash are liabilities, regardless of the probability of the occurrence of the triggering event. If warrants do not otherwise require liability classification, the Company assesses whether the warrants are indexed to its common stock. Liability-classified warrants are measured at fair value on the issuance date and at the end of each reporting period. Any change in the fair value of the warrants after the issuance date is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a gain or loss. Equity-classified warrants are accounted for at fair value on the issuance date with no changes in fair value recognized after the issuance date.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Included in research and development expenses are salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits of employees and other operational costs related to the Company’s research and development activities, including external costs of outside vendors engaged to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing costs of the Company’s products prior to regulatory approval, costs related to collaboration agreements and facility-related expenses.
The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing research and development costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received, estimates provided by vendors, and contracted costs. Judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company’s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, and nonemployees at the fair value on the date of the grant. The fair value of the awards is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The straight-line method of expense recognition is applied to all awards with service-only conditions. For awards that include both service and performance conditions, the Company starts recognizing the fair value of the awards as expense when achievement of the underlying performance conditions is probable, based on the portion of the requisite service period completed.
The Company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate, the Company has considered its historical experience to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures for service-based awards. The impact of a forfeiture rate adjustment will be recognized in full in the period of adjustment, and if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the Company’s estimate, the Company may be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation expense in future periods.
Compensation cost related to shares purchased through the Company’s employee stock purchase plan, which is considered compensatory, is based on the estimated fair value of the shares on the offering date, including consideration of the discount and the look-back period. The Company estimates the fair value of the shares using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense is recognized over the 
six
-month withholding period prior to the purchase date.
The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. 
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate.
Interest and penalties related to income taxes are recorded as part of the income tax provision.
Segment Data
The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07 
Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 in these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no items that gave rise to other comprehensive loss and therefore, there was no difference between net loss and comprehensive loss.

Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net loss attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities, outstanding stock options, and outstanding restricted stock units, except where the result would be anti-dilutive. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of the conversion of convertible debt securities, the exercise of outstanding stock options, and the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units. In the diluted net loss per share calculation, net loss would also be adjusted for the elimination of interest expense on convertible debt securities and the mark-to-market gain or loss on bifurcated conversion options, if the impact was not anti-dilutive. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 
Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The amendments require (i) enhanced disclosures in connection with an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and (ii) 
F-15

Table of Contents
income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of the amendments to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The new standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. 
The Company does not expect the adoption of the amendments to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
The Company believes that other recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

3. Licensing Agreements and Deferred Revenue
Incept License Agreement (in-licensing)
On September 13, 2018, the Company entered into a second amended and restated license agreement with Incept, LLC (“Incept”) to use and develop certain intellectual property (the “Incept License”). Under the Incept License, as amended and restated, the Company was granted a worldwide, perpetual, exclusive license to use specific Incept technology to develop and commercialize products that are delivered to or around the human eye for diagnostic, therapeutic or prophylactic purposes relating to ophthalmic diseases or conditions. The Company is obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on net sales of commercial products developed using the licensed technology, commencing with the date of the first commercial sale of such products and until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents covered by the license. Any of the Company’s sublicensees also will be obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by it and will be bound by the terms of the agreement to the same extent as the Company. The Company is obligated to reimburse Incept for its share of the reasonable fees and costs incurred by Incept in connection with the prosecution of the patent applications licensed to the Company under the Incept License.
Royalties paid under this agreement related to product sales were $
1,834
, $
1,713
 and $
1,466
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Royalties have been charged to cost of product revenue.
AffaMed License Agreement (out-licensing)
On October 29, 2020, the Company entered into a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with AffaMed Therapeutic Limited (“AffaMed”) for the development and commercialization of the Company’s DEXTENZA product regarding ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery and allergic conjunctivitis (collectively, the “DEXTENZA Field”) and for the Company’s PAXTRAVA, formerly known as OTX-TIC, product candidate (collectively with DEXTENZA, the “AffaMed Licensed Products”) regarding OAG or OHT (collectively, the “TIC Field” and, with the DEXTENZA Field, each a “Field”), in each case in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, and the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (collectively, the “Territories”). The Company retains development and commercialization rights for the AffaMed Licensed Products in the rest of the world.
Under the License Agreement, the Company received a non-refundable upfront payment of $
12,000
 in December 2020, a $
1,000
 milestone in the fourth quarter of 2021, a $
2,000
 clinical support payment in the second quarter of 2022, and a $
1,000
 milestone payment in the second quarter of 2023. The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional $
87,000
 in aggregate upon the achievement of certain regulatory, development and commercial milestones. The Company is also entitled to receive tiered, escalating royalties on the net sales of the AffaMed Licensed Products ranging from a low-teen to low-twenties percentage. Royalties under the License Agreement are payable on an AffaMed Licensed Product-by-AffaMed Licensed Product and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and are subject to potential reductions in specified circumstances, subject to a specified floor. 
Under the License Agreement, the Company is generally responsible for expenses related to the development of the AffaMed Licensed Products in the applicable Fields in the Territories, provided that AffaMed (i) reimburse the Company a low-teen percentage of expenses incurred in connection with certain clinical trials conducted by the Company and designed to support marketing approval of the AffaMed Licensed Product by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency (“Global Studies”); (ii) is solely responsible for expenses incurred in connection with territory-
F-16

Table of Contents
specific clinical trials that it conducts in furtherance of the development plan agreed between the parties in the applicable Fields in the Territories (“Local Studies”); and (iii) reimburse the Company in full for expenses incurred in connection with obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals of the AffaMed Licensed Products in the applicable Fields in the Territories. In the event AffaMed declines to participate in a Global Study or to conduct a Local Study in any jurisdiction in which the Company determines to conduct such a study, the Company is relieved of its obligation to provide AffaMed clinical data from such study, other than safety data, unless AffaMed subsequently reimburses the Company in the amounts described above plus a prespecified premium. 
The License Agreement expires upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last AffaMed Licensed Product in any applicable Field in the Territories. Either party may, subject to specified cure periods, terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured breach. Either party may also terminate the License Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the other party’s insolvency. AffaMed has the right to terminate the License Agreement at any time after completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial for PAXTRAVA for any or no reason upon providing the Company three months’ notice.  During an established period following its change of control or its entry into a global licensing agreement that includes the Territories with a third party, the Company has the option to terminate the License Agreement, subject to a specified notice period and the repayment of any costs and expenses incurred by AffaMed in connection with the License Agreement, including upfront and milestone payments AffaMed has previously paid to the Company, at a prespecified premium.
The Company concluded that AffaMed is a customer in this arrangement, and as such, the arrangement falls within the scope of the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 606. 
At the inception of the License Agreement, the Company identified the following performance obligations in the agreement:
●
the license, regulatory filings and manufacturing of DEXTENZA (the “DEXTENZA Field performance obligation”);
●
the license, regulatory filings and manufacturing for the Company’s PAXTRAVA product candidate regarding OAG or OHT in the Territories (the “PAXTRAVA Field performance obligation”);
●
the conduct of a Phase 2 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA (the “Phase 2 Clinical Trial of PAXTRAVA performance obligation”); and 
●
obligations to participate on various joint research, development and project committees, which the Company has concluded is not a material performance obligation.
The transaction price was allocated to the performance obligations based on the relative estimated standalone selling prices of each performance obligation.
The Company developed the estimated standalone selling price for the services and/or manufacturing and supply included in each of the performance obligations, as applicable, primarily based on the nature of the services to be performed and/or goods to be manufactured and estimates of the associated costs, adjusted for a reasonable profit margin that would be expected to be realized under similar contracts.
The Company has determined that any sales-based royalties and milestones will be recognized as the Company delivers the clinical and commercial manufactured product to AffaMed. Any changes in estimates may result in a cumulative catch-up based on the number of units of manufactured product delivered. 
As of December 31, 2024, the transaction price was determined to be $
16,000
. All potential regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments in the amount of $
87,000
 did not meet the recognition criteria under the most likely method, because their achievement was highly dependent on factors outside the control of the Company and therefore, were excluded from the transaction price as of December 31, 2024.

7. Leases
The Company leases real estate, including laboratory, manufacturing and office space, and certain equipment. The Company’s 
two
 real estate leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 
2.5
 years and 
3.5
 years, respectively. The Company’s equipment leases have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 
2
 to 
3.5
 years. All of the Company’s leases qualify as operating leases. 
The lease for the Company’s 
20,445
 square feet of manufacturing space located at 36 Crosby Drive in Bedford, Massachusetts commenced on June 30, 2018. On October 18, 2022, the Company exercised its option to extend the lease agreement by an additional 
five
-year term, resulting in a new expiration date of July 31, 2028. Under the terms of the existing lease, rent for the 
five
-year extension period was based on the current fair market rent for comparable space in the building and in other similar buildings in the same rental market as of August 1, 2023, the commencement date of the additional 
five
-year term. The Company estimated the prevailing market rental rates at the time when the Company exercised the renewal option and included these in the remeasurement of the operating lease asset and the lease liability. This resulted in an increase of the operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of $
4,284
 as of the remeasurement date. As this is an estimate for variable payments that depend on an index or a rate, the Company has not remeasured the payments for the 
five
-year renewal period as of the commencement date of the 
five
-year extension term. On June 30, 2023, the Company and the landlord executed an amendment to this lease, formally extending the term of the lease through July 31, 2028. This lease does not include any additional renewal options.
The lease for the Company’s approximately 
70,712
 square feet of general office, research and development and manufacturing space located at 15 Crosby Drive in Bedford, Massachusetts commenced on February 1, 2017 and will expire on July 31, 2027.  The Company has the option to extend the lease for 
two
 additional periods of 
five years
 each by delivering written notice of the exercise not earlier than 
fifteen months
 nor later than 
12 months
 before expiration of the original term.
The lease for the Company’s approximately 
30,036
 square feet of office space located at 24 Crosby Drive in Bedford, Massachusetts commenced on April 18, 2019 and terminated on March 31, 2024.
Certain equipment leases include options to renew on a month-by-month basis, at the sole discretion of the Company.

9. Financial Liabilities
Barings Credit Agreement
On August 2, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a credit and security agreement (the “Barings Credit Agreement”) with Barings Finance LLC (“Barings”), as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, providing for a secured term loan facility for the Company (the “Barings Credit Facility”) in the aggregate principal amount of $
82,474
 (the “Total Credit Facility Amount”). The Company borrowed the full amount of $
82,474
 at closing and received proceeds of $
77,290
, after the application of an original issue discount and fees. Indebtedness under the Barings Credit Facility matures on the earlier to occur of (i) the six-year anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date for the Company’s Convertible Notes (as defined below). Indebtedness under the Barings Credit Facility incurs interest based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), subject to a 
minimum

1.50
% floor, 
plus

6.75
%. The Company is obligated to make interest payments on its indebtedness under the Barings Credit Facility on a monthly basis, commencing on the Closing Date; to pay annual administration fees; and to pay, on the maturity date, any principal and accrued interest that remains outstanding as of such date. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a fee in an amount equal to the Total Credit Facility Amount, which amount shall be reduced by the total amount of interest and principal prepayment fees paid under the Barings Credit Agreement (such fee, the “Barings Royalty Fee”). The Company is required to pay the Barings Royalty Fee in installments to Barings, for the benefit of the lenders, on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to three and one-half percent (
3.5
%) of the net sales of DEXTENZA occurring during such quarter, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations specified in the Barings Credit Agreement, until the Barings Royalty Fee is paid in full. The Barings Royalty Fee is due and payable upon a change of control of the Company. The Company may, at its option, prepay any or all of the Barings Royalty Fee at any time without penalty. In connection with the Barings Credit Agreement, the Company granted the lenders thereto a first-priority security interest in all assets of the Company, including its intellectual property, subject to certain agreed-upon exceptions. The Barings Credit Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires the Company to maintain a minimum liquidity amount of $
20,000
. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was not in violation of any of its covenants under the Barings Credit Agreement.
The Company determined that the embedded obligation to pay the Barings Royalty Fee (the “Barings Royalty Fee Obligation”) is required to be separated from the Barings Credit Facility and accounted for as a freestanding derivative instrument subject to derivative accounting. The allocation of proceeds to the Barings Royalty Fee Obligation resulted in a discount on the Barings Credit Facility. The Company is amortizing the discount to interest expense over the term of the Barings Credit Facility using the effective interest method. Accrued or paid Barings Royalty Fees are included in the change in fair value of derivative liabilities on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Barings Royalty Fees were $
2,2
21 and $
901
, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, the full principal for the Barings Credit Facility of $
82,474
 was due for repayment in 2029.
Convertible Notes 
On March 1, 2019, the Company issued $
37,500
 of convertible notes (as amended, the “Convertible Notes”).
On March 28, 2024, the Company issued 
5,769,232
 shares of its common stock with a total fair value of $
52,500
 to the holder of the Convertible Notes in connection with the conversion of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes (the “Conversion”) and paid the holder $
11,361
 for accrued interest. The extinguishment of obligations under the Convertible Notes and the resulting derecognition of the principal of the Convertible Notes ($
37,500
), the unamortized discount ($
27,950
), and the Conversion Option Derivative Liability ($
15,000
), resulted in a net loss of $
27,950
, which was charged to gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Concurrently with entering into the Barings Credit Agreement, on August 2, 2023, the Company and the holders of the Convertible Notes extended the maturity of the Convertible Notes, which would otherwise have matured on March 1, 2026, to a date 91 days following the maturity of the indebtedness under the Barings Credit Facility, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed (the “Amendment”). The Company accounted for the Amendment as an extinguishment of debt in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 470-50 
Debt
 (“ASC 470-50”) and derecognized all liabilities related to the Convertible Notes, including the outstanding principal less unamortized discount, a derivative liability, and accrued interest, with a total carrying value of $
51,090
 as of the date of the Amendment. The Company determined that, after the Amendment, the embedded conversion option continues to be required to be separated from the Convertible Notes and accounted for the embedded conversion option as a freestanding derivative instrument subject to derivative accounting (the “Conversion Option Derivative Liability”). The total fair value of the Convertible Notes on August 2, 2023 after the Amendment, including the conversion option, was $
36,183
. The Company recognized the Convertible Notes and the Conversion Option Derivative Liability after the Amendment at their fair values as of the date of the Amendment of $
18,482
 and $
17,701
, respectively. A portion of the fair value of the Convertible Notes as of the date of the Amendment of $
9,943
 was presented in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 because the Convertible Notes were convertible at that date, and this amount represented interest that was accrued before the Amendment and that would be payable in cash upon conversion. The allocation of a portion of the total fair value of the Convertible Notes to the Conversion Option Derivative Liability results in a discount on the Convertible Notes. Application of ASC 470-50 resulted in a gain on extinguishment of $
14,907
, which was charged to gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The holders of the Convertible Notes were entitled to convert all or part of the outstanding principal amount of their Convertible Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, prior to maturity based on certain terms and conditions. The Company determined that the embedded conversion option was required to be separated from the Convertible Notes and accounted for as a freestanding derivative instrument subject to derivative accounting. The allocation of proceeds to the conversion option results in a discount on the Convertible Notes. The Company amortized the discount to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. 
The Company presented accrued interest in accrued current liabilities because the notes were convertible and the interest was payable in cash. The effective annual interest rate for the Convertible Notes was 
19.4
% and 
14.8
% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Notes Payable
The Company entered into a credit and security agreement in 2014 (as amended, the “MidCap Credit Agreement”) establishing a credit facility (as amended, the “MidCap Credit Facility”). The Company satisfied its obligations under the MidCap Credit Agreement in August 2023, as discussed below. In connection with its satisfaction of its obligations, the Company extinguished the MidCap Credit Facility, and all liens and security interests securing the indebtedness under the MidCap Credit Agreement were released.
In June 2021, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement (the “Fourth Amendment”) to amend the terms of its debt with existing lenders for total indebtedness of $
20,833
 and borrowed an incremental $
4,167
, for a total of $
25,000
. Under the Fourth Amendment, the Company was required to make interest-only payments through April 2024. Commencing in May 2024, the Company was required to make 
19
 equal monthly installments of principal in the amount of $
1,042
, plus interest, then on the maturity date, November 30, 2025 the remaining balance of $
5,208
 plus the exit fee, as defined below. Amounts borrowed under the MidCap Credit Facility based on the Fourth Amendment were initially at LIBOR base rate, subject to 
1.00
% 
floor
, plus 
6.75
%.  In addition, a final payment (exit fee) equal to 
3.5
% of amounts drawn under the MidCap Credit Facility, or $
875
 based on borrowings of $
25,000
, was due upon the maturity date of November 30, 2025. The Company had accrued the exit fee through November 30, 2025. The Company accounted for the Fourth Amendment as a modification in accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-50 
Debt
.  Amounts paid to the lenders were recorded as debt discount and a new effective interest rate was established.
On March 12, 2023, the Company requested, and received, a protective advance of $
2,000
 under the MidCap Credit Agreement as a short-term bridge loan in response to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. This protective advance was deemed a credit extension. The Company repaid the full principal amount of $
2,000
 in March 2023.
On March 31, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the MidCap Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”) to replace the LIBOR-based interest rate provisions of the MidCap Credit Agreement with interest rate provisions based on SOFR, establish a benchmark replacement mechanism and make additional administrative updates. The Company accounted for Amendment No. 1 as a modification in accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-50 
Debt
. Application of the modification accounting guidance did not have a material effect on the carrying amount of the long-term notes payable.
On May 4, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the MidCap Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”). Amendment No. 2 provided that the Company may maintain up to 
50
% of its consolidated cash and cash equivalents with banks or financial institutions other than Silicon Valley Bank and made additional administrative updates.

Table of Contents
In August 2023, in connection with the Company’s establishment of the Barings Credit Facility, the Company paid an aggregate of $
26,157
 to MidCap Financial Trust and the other lenders party to the MidCap Credit Agreement, comprised of $
25,017
 in principal and interest accrued thereunder and $
1,140
 in exit and prepayment fees, in satisfaction of the Company’s obligations under the MidCap Credit Agreement. In connection with the payment, all liens and security interests securing the indebtedness under the MidCap Credit Agreement were released. The extinguishment of the MidCap Credit Facility has resulted in a loss of $
717
, which was charged to gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.
​
10. Derivatives
Barings Credit Agreement
The Barings Credit Agreement (Note 9) contains an embedded Royalty Fee Obligation that meets the criteria to be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the Barings Credit Facility (the "Royalty Fee Derivative Liability"). The Royalty Fee Derivative Liability was recorded at fair value upon the entering into the Barings Credit Facility and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Royalty Fee Derivative Liability was initially valued and is remeasured using a “with-and-without” method. The “with-and-without” methodology involves valuing the whole instrument on an as-is basis with the embedded Royalty Fee Obligation and then valuing the instrument without the embedded Royalty Fee Obligation. Royalty payments are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Refer to Note 11 for details regarding the determination of fair value.

The Convertible Notes (Note 9) contained the Conversion Option Derivative Liability, an embedded conversion option that met the criteria to be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the Convertible Notes. The Conversion Option Derivative Liability was recorded at fair value upon the issuance of the Convertible Notes and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Conversion Option Derivative Liability was initially valued and subsequently remeasured using a “with-and-without” method. The “with-and-without” methodology involved valuing the whole instrument on an as-is basis with the embedded conversion option and then valuing the instrument without the embedded conversion option. The difference between the entire instrument with the embedded conversion option compared to the instrument without the embedded conversion option was the fair value of the derivative, recorded as the Conversion Option Derivative Liability. Refer to Note 11 for details regarding the determination of fair value.

11. Risks and Fair Value
Concentration of Credit Risk and of Significant Suppliers and Customers
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company has its cash and cash equivalents balances at 
two
 accredited financial institutions, in amounts that exceed federally insured limits. The Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.

The Company is dependent on a small number of third-party manufacturers to supply products for research and development activities in its preclinical and clinical programs and for sales of its products. The Company’s development programs as well as revenue from future product sales could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the supply of any of the components of these products.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
The carrying value of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 
Barings Credit Agreement and Royalty Fee Derivative Liability
At December 31, 2024, the Barings Credit Facility, net of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, was carried at amortized cost totaling $
69,097
, comprised of the $
68,505
 non-current liability (Note 9) and $
592
 accrued interest (Note 8). The estimated fair value of the Barings Credit Facility, without the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, was $
73,608
 at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Barings Credit Facility, net of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, was carried at amortized cost totaling $
66,590
 comprised of the $
65,787
 non-current liability (Note 9) and $
803
 accrued interest (Note 8). The estimated fair value of the Barings Credit Facility, without the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability, was $
72,295
 at December 31, 2023.
The fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The use of this approach requires the use of Level 3 unobservable inputs. The main inputs when determining the fair value of the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability are the amount and timing of the expected future revenue of the Company, the estimated volatility of these revenues, and the discount rate corresponding to the risk of revenue. The estimated fair value presented is not necessarily indicative of an amount that could be realized in a current market exchange. The use of alternative inputs and estimation methodologies could have a material effect on these estimates of fair value.
The main inputs to valuing the Royalty Fee Derivative Liability are as follows:

Convertible Notes and Conversion Option Derivative Liability
At December 31, 2023, the Convertible Notes, net of the Conversion Option Derivative Liability, were carried at amortized cost totaling $
20,024
, comprised of the $
9,138
 non-current liability (Note 9) and $
10,886
 accrued interest (Note 8). The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes, without the Conversion Option Derivative Liability, was $
22,665
 at December 31, 2023. 
The fair value of the Convertible Notes with and without the conversion option as of December 31, 2023 and previous periods was estimated using a binomial lattice approach. The use of this approach required the use of Level 3 unobservable inputs. The main input when determining the fair value of the Convertible Notes was the bond yield that pertained to the host instrument without the conversion option. The significant assumption used in determining the bond yield was the market yield movements of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date, which was assessed and updated each period. The main input when determining the fair value for disclosure purposes was the bond yield which was updated each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date. The estimated fair value presented was not necessarily indicative of an amount that could have been realized in a current market exchange. The fair value of the Conversion Option Derivative Liability immediately before the Conversion was determined based on the intrinsic value of the separated conversion option. 
The main inputs to valuing the Convertible Notes with the conversion option are as follows:

The bond yield was derived by making the fair value of the Convertible Notes equal to the face value on the issuance date. Fair value measurements are highly sensitive to changes in these inputs and significant changes in these inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value.
12. Equity
Preferred Stock
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has authorized 
5,000,000
 shares of preferred stock, $
0.0001
 par value, all of which is undesignated and 
none
 of which 
are

issued
 or 
outstanding
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Common Stock 
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorized 
100,000,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock.  
Each share of common stock entitles the holder to 
one
 vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders.
  In June 2021, the Company adopted an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation increasing the number of its authorized shares of its common stock to 
200,000,000
 shares, and in June 2024, the Company adopted a further amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation increasing the number of its authorized shares of its common stock by 
200,000,000
 shares to 
400,000,000
 shares.
On February 21, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional accredited investors (the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Investors in a private placement an aggregate of 
32,413,560
 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “Shares”), at a price of $
7.52
 per share, and, to certain Investors in lieu of Shares, pre-funded warrants to purchase 
10,805,957
 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), at a price 
F-27

Table of Contents
of $
7.519
 per Pre-Funded Warrant (the “2024 Private Placement”). Each Pre-Funded Warrant issued in the 2024 Private Placement has an exercise price of $
0.001
 per share, is currently exercisable and will remain exercisable until the Pre-Funded Warrant is exercised in full. The 2024 Private Placement closed on February 26, 2024. The Company received total net proceeds from the 2024 Private Placement of approximately $
316,353
 after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. The Company accounts for the Pre-Funded Warrants as a component of permanent equity. In connection with entering into the Securities Purchase Agreement, also on February 21, 2024, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the Investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to register for resale the Shares and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants (together with the Shares, the “Registrable Securities”). The Company filed a registration statement regarding the Registrable Securities on Form S-3 with the SEC on March 25, 2024.
On March 28, 2024, the Company issued 
5,769,232
 shares of its common stock to the holder of the Convertible Notes in connection with the Conversion. The newly issued shares of common stock were valued at fair value, being the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that day, resulting in an increase in par value of the Company’s common stock of $
1
 and an increase in additional paid-in capital of $
52,499
.
On April 5, 2019, the Company entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement (the “2019 Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), under which the Company may offer and sell its common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $
50,000
 from time-to-time through Jefferies, acting as agent. The Company did not sell any shares of common stock under the 2019 Sales Agreement in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. On August 9, 2021, the Company and Jefferies mutually terminated the 2019 Sales Agreement and entered into another Open Market Sale Agreement (the “2021 Sales Agreement”) under which the Company may offer and sell shares of common stock of the Company having an aggregate offering price of up to $
100,000
 from time to time through Jefferies, acting as agent. The Company did 
no
t offer or sell shares of its common stock under the 2021 Sales Agreement during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, respectively. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 
1,514,926
 shares of common stock under the 2021 Sales Agreement, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $
9,897

9,532
. 
On December 13, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies, BofA Securities, Inc. and Piper Sandler & Co. (collectively “the Underwriters”) in connection with an underwritten public offering of 
30,800,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock. Under the terms of this underwriting agreement, the Company also granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 
4,620,000
 shares of common stock at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On December 17, 2023, the Company sold all 
35,420,000
 shares of common stock and closed this underwritten public offering. The public offering price of the shares in this offering was $
3.25
 per share, and the Underwriters purchased all of the shares from the Company at a price of $
3.055
 per share. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the offering of $
107,725
.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had reserved 
9,260,579
 shares of common stock for future grants of stock-based awards under its stock-based compensation plans (Note 13).
​
13. Stock-Based Awards
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
three
 stock-based compensation plans under which it was able to grant stock-based awards, the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2021 Plan”), the 2019 Inducement Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2019 Inducement Plan”), and the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) (collectively the “Stock Plans”). Certain inducement awards made prior to inception of the 2019 Inducement Plan were issued outside of the Stock Plans. The purpose of the Stock Plans is to provide incentives to employees, directors, and nonemployee consultants. The 2021 Plan and the 2019 Inducement Plan provide for the grant of non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. The 2021 Plan also provides for the grant of incentive stock options. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the Company had a number of vested stock awards outstanding that were granted under the Company’s 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). Effective as of the adoption of the 2021 Plan on June 18, 2021 by the Company’s stockholders, 
no
 new awards have been granted under the 2014 Plan. However, as of December 31, 2024, all then-outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan remained in effect and continued to be governed by the terms of the 2014 Plan. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the Company had an 
F-28

Table of Contents
immaterial number of vested stock awards outstanding that were granted under the Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”). Effective as of the adoption of the 2014 Plan by the Company’s stockholders in 2014, 
no
 new awards have been granted under the 2006 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, all then outstanding awards under the 2006 Plan remained in effect and continued to be governed by the terms of the 2006 Plan.
2021 Plan
 - The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan was 
6,000,000
 shares of common stock; plus 
456,334
 shares remaining available for grant under the 2014 Plan as of immediately prior to the effective date of the 2021 Plan and 
9,766,336
 shares subject to awards granted under the 2014 Plan or the 2006 Plan, which awards expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, canceled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right (subject to certain limitations). On June 16, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment (“Amendment No. 1”) to the Company’s 2021 Plan. Amendment No. 1 increased the number of shares of common stock that is reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan by 
3,600,000
. On June 14, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment (“Amendment No. 2”) to the Company’s 2021 Plan. Amendment No. 2 increased the number of shares of common stock that is reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan by 
3,900,000
. On June 12, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment (“Amendment No. 3”) to the Company’s 2021 Plan. Amendment No. 3 increased the number of shares of common stock that is reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan by 
7,000,000
. As of December 31, 2024, 
8,019,151
 shares remained available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.
2019 Inducement Plan
 - Awards under the 2019 Inducement Plan may only be granted to persons who (a) were not previously an employee or director of the Company or (b) are commencing employment with the Company following a bona fide period of non-employment, in either case as an inducement material to the individual’s entering into employment with the Company and in accordance with the requirements of Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5635(c)(4).  For the avoidance of doubt, neither consultants nor advisors shall be eligible to participate in the 2019 Inducement Plan.  Each person who is granted an Award under the 2019 Inducement Plan is deemed a “Participant”. On December 10, 2020, the board of directors of the Company amended the 2019 Inducement Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares issuable by 
554,000
 shares of common stock to 
1,054,000
.  On February 20, 2024, the Company’s board of directors amended the 2019 Inducement Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares issuable thereunder from 
1,054,000
 to 
3,804,000
 shares of common stock. On April 16, 2024, the board of directors of the Company further amended the 2019 Inducement Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares issuable thereunder from 
3,804,000
 to 
4,804,000
 shares of common stock. On October 4, 2024, the board of directors of the Company further amended the 2019 Inducement Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares issuable thereunder from 
4,804,000
 to 
6,054,000
 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, 
848,373
 shares remained available for issuance under the 2019 Inducement Plan.
ESPP
 – The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP was 
207,402
 shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of each fiscal year, commencing on January 1, 2015 and ending on December 31, 2024, in an amount equal to the least of 
207,402
 shares of the Company’s common stock, 
0.5
% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the first day of the applicable fiscal year, and an amount determined by the Company’s board of directors. On January 1, 2023, the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP increased by 
207,402
. On January 1, 2024, the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP increased from 
398,784
 to 
606,186
. As of December 31, 2024, 
393,055
 shares of common stock remained available for issuance.
Stock options granted pursuant to the Stock Plans, excluding awards under the ESPP, are granted at exercise prices not to be less than the fair value of common shares as of the date of grant. They generally require a service period of 
4 years
 and generally vest monthly, or 
1/4
 on the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remainder vesting monthly over the remaining three years. Stock Options granted under the 2019 Inducement Plan may in addition be subject to performance-based vesting. The maximum contractual term of Stock Options granted under the Stock Plans is generally 
10 years
. RSUs granted pursuant to the Stock Plans generally require a service period of 
3 years
 and generally vest 
1/3
 on each anniversary of the grant date. Certain RSUs granted to certain newly hired executive and senior-level employees in the year ended December 31, 2024 require a service period of 
3 years
 and vest quarterly. An immaterial number of RSUs granted to employees in the year ended December 31, 2024 vest fully on the first anniversary of the grant and are, in addition, subject to performance conditions.

Valuation of Awards
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected life of the options was calculated using the simplified method. The simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period for all option tranches. The Company utilizes the simplified method because the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data over the life of awards to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. 
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  The Company uses its historical volatility to estimate expected volatility.
The assumptions that the Company used to determine the fair value of the stock options granted to employees and directors are as follows, presented on a weighted average basis:

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $
538,025
 and $
385,224
, respectively.  The federal and state NOLs generated for annual periods prior to January 1, 2018 begin to expire in 2026. The Company’s federal NOLs generated for the years ended on or after December 31, 2018, which amount to a total of $
412,220
, can be carried forward indefinitely, although the deduction for such NOLs is limited to 80% of current year taxable income. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had available research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $
19,666
 and $
11,848
, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. Utilization of the NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Section 382”) due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company has not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study. If the Company has experienced a change of control, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, which is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets. Management considered the Company’s cumulative net losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company would not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was established against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
The Company has 
no
t recorded any amounts for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending income tax examinations that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s tax years are still open under statute from the Company’s fiscal year 2021 to the present. Earlier years may be examined to the extent that tax credit or net operating loss carryforwards are used in future periods.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, there was 
no
 dilutive impact from potentially issuable common shares. Therefore, diluted net loss per share was the same as basic net loss per share. As of December 31, 2024, the Pre-Funded Warrants (Note 12) are included in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share.
The Company excluded the following common stock equivalents, outstanding as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 because they had an anti-dilutive impact due to the net loss incurred for the periods.

17. Segment Reporting
The Company operates as a single operating segment. Its operations consist of developing and commercializing innovative therapies for retinal diseases and other eye conditions based on its ELUTYX proprietary bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology.
Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who the Company has determined to be, collectively, the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). 
The Company’s research and development function is responsible for research and discovery of new product candidates, and the pre-clinical and clinical development of, and related registration efforts for, the Company’s product candidates. The Company’s operations and technical function is responsible for supply chain, the manufacturing of the Company’s commercial products and clinical trial material, and facilities. The Company’s sales and marketing function is responsible for the commercialization of its products and market access activities. The Company’s operations are supported by corporate functions. Managing and allocating resources on a total company basis enables the Company’s CODM to assess the overall level of resources available and how to best deploy these resources across functions and development projects in line with the Company’s strategy. Consistent with this approach, the CODM uses consolidated, single-segment financial information for the purposes of developing budgets and forecasts, assessing performance, allocating resources, and setting incentive targets.
