Summary of Risks Related to our Business
Our business, financial condition, results of operations, future growth prospects and common stock price are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should be aware of before making an investment decision, as more fully described under the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
●
We have a history of incurring significant losses. Ou
r net losses were $
193.5 
million and $80.7 million for the y
ears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $891.1 million. We expect to incur operating losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.
●
We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders’ ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders’ rights as holders of our common stock.  Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
●
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, products or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
●
If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.  
●
We have substantial indebtedness including under our secured term loan facility pursuant to our credit and security agreement with Barings Finance LLC as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. Our substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business or otherwise affect our operations.
●
We depend heavily on the success of our product candidate AXPAXLI and our commercial product DEXTENZA. Our ability to generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability is dependent on obtaining marketing approval for and successfully commercializing AXPAXLI, and our successful commercialization of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.
●
Clinical trials of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, may not be successful. If we experience delays or difficulties in enrollment, serious adverse events or side effects are identified, or any other unforeseen events occur in connection with clinical trials of any of our product candidates, or if clinical trials of any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidates.
●
We may experience unforeseen events that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates. Clinical trials of our product candidates could produce negative or inconclusive results, or we could disagree with regulators regarding clinical trial results. We may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs. Enrollment in clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate. The cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate.

●
We are conducting our SOL-1 trial under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement agreed to by the FDA. An SPA agreement indicates concurrence by the FDA with the adequacy and acceptability of specific critical elements of the overall protocol design for a clinical trial intended to support a future marketing application, but it does not indicate FDA concurrence on every protocol detail. Moreover, the FDA retains significant discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA agreement and the data and results from any trial that is the subject of an SPA agreement. An SPA agreement does not ensure the receipt of marketing approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities or that the approval process will be faster than conventional procedures. 
●
We have a single-site manufacturing facility for DEXTENZA, and we have a separate single-site manufacturing facility for product candidates that we use in our clinical trials and other research and development activities, including AXPAXLI. We also depend from time to time on single-source suppliers for certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates.  If we have a material disruption in our manufacturing operations at this facility, or if we are unable to obtain sufficient components of our products and product candidates from our suppliers on acceptable terms or at all, we may not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our clinical trial requirements or of our product inventory to meet our commercial requirements. Such an event could delay our clinical trials or, particularly because we maintain limited commercial inventory, could reduce our product sales.
●
DEXTENZA, and any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, may become subject to less favorable or unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage or reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business. For instance, if DEXTENZA ceases to be eligible for reimbursement separate from ophthalmic surgery in the ambulatory surgical center setting, our net product revenues would decline significantly, and our ability to generate revenues from future sales of DEXTENZA would be adversely affected. 
●
If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, maintain regulatory compliance for our manufacturing operations, obtain and maintain patent protection for or gain market acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors and others in the medical community of DEXTENZA or any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed and our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be materially impaired.
●
Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.  The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.  
●
Our products face and, if approved, our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, will face competition from generic, biosimilar and branded versions of existing drugs, many of which have achieved widespread acceptance among physicians, payors and patients for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases and conditions. In addition, because the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our products and leading product candidates are available on a generic basis, competitors may be able to prepare and submit applications for abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, or foreign equivalents for generic versions of our products without the need to conduct clinical development and may be able to offer and sell products, whether approved through the ANDA process or otherwise, with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products so long as these competitors do not infringe our patent rights.
●
Even if we successfully obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, the approved product will be subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation.
●
Our stock price is volatile and fluctuates substantially. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it.  We have previously, and we may in the future, be the target of legal proceedings related to declines in our stock price.
