1A. Risk Factors.  
The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading “Summary of Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital
We have a history of incurring significant losses. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.
We have a history of incurring significant losses. Our net losses were $193.5 million and $80.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $891.1 million. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings and private placements of our common stock, borrowings under credit facilities, the private placement of convertible notes, and sales of our products. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the commercialization of DEXTENZA. Although we expect to continue to generate revenue from sales of DEXTENZA, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.
We anticipate we will incur substantial expenses if and as we:
●
continue our ongoing clinical trials, including our two registrational Phase 3 clinical trials of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which we refer to as the SOL-1 and SOL-R trials;
58

Table of Contents
●
initiate any additional clinical trials we might determine in the future to conduct for our product candidates, including any clinical trials that we might conduct for AXPAXLI for the treatment of patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or NPDR, and diabetic macular edema, or DME;
●
scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval and expand our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel; 
●
scale up our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to prepare for commercialization of any product candidates for which we intend to obtain marketing approval;
●
seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;
●
continue to monitor subjects according to the applicable clinical trial protocols, or prepare submission documentation such as clinical study reports, for our clinical trials that have been completed;
●
continue to commercialize DEXTENZA in the United States;
●
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 
●
expand our operational, quality assurance, financial, administrative and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts; 
●
defend ourselves against legal proceedings, if any;
●
make investments to improve our defenses against cybersecurity threats and establish and maintain cybersecurity insurance; 
●
increase our product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and commercialization efforts; and 
●
continue to operate as a public company.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our development expenses will increase if:
●
we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the other regulatory authorities to perform trials or studies in addition to those currently expected;
●
there are any delays in receipt of regulatory clearance to begin our planned clinical programs; 
●
there are any delays in enrollment of subjects in or completion of our clinical trials or the development of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates; or 
●
there are any delays in receiving marketing approval of AXPAXLI or any of our other product candidates.
For us to become and remain profitable, we will need to continue to successfully commercialize DEXTENZA and to successfully develop and commercialize other products with significant market potential. This will require us or our current or future collaborators to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:
●
completing clinical development of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI;
●
obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates;
59

Table of Contents
●
continuing to commercialize DEXTENZA in the United States, including by further developing our manufacturing, marketing, sales force, and distribution capabilities;
●
manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing any other products for which we obtain marketing approval;
●
achieving an adequate level of market acceptance of and obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, private insurers, and other third-party payors for our products; and
●
protecting our rights to our intellectual property portfolio.
Even if we succeed in our commercialization efforts, we may never generate revenue that is sufficient to achieve profitability.  We do not anticipate that revenue from sales of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis will be sufficient for us to become profitable for several years, if ever.  
Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations.  A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.   
We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.
We expect to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, particularly if and as we advance our product candidate AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD through clinical development and continue to commercialize DEXTENZA. We expect to devote substantial financial resources as we conduct late-stage clinical trials for our product candidates, including the SOL-1 trial and the SOL-R trial, seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical results, and commercialize any products for which we receive marketing approval.  In addition, we plan to devote significant financial resources to conduct research and development of our other product candidates. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding to fully support our continuing and planned operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $392.1 million, and outstanding debt with a principal amount of $82.5 million under a credit and security agreement, or the Barings Credit Agreement, with Barings Finance LLC, or Barings, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, or the Barings Credit Facility. Based on our current operating plan, which includes estimates of anticipated cash inflows from DEXTENZA product sales and cash outflows from operating expenses and capital expenditures and reflects our observance of the minimum liquidity covenant of $20.0 million under the Barings Credit Agreement, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. 
Our planned operating expenses do not include the expenses necessary to conduct a clinical trial of AXPAXLI for NPDR and DME, or to build out our manufacturing capabilities beyond the buildout of our existing manufacturing facilities. 
These estimates are subject to various assumptions, including assumptions as to the revenues and expenses associated with the commercialization of DEXTENZA, the pace of our research and clinical development programs, the timing of commencement of dosing and enrollment of our clinical trials, and other aspects of our business. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
●
the progress, costs and outcome of our ongoing clinical trials of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD;
●
the timing, scope, progress, costs and outcome of a potential registrational clinical program of AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and DME;
60

Table of Contents
●
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory authorities;
●
the scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and any additional clinical trials we might determine in the future to conduct for our other product candidates, including PAXTRAVA for the reduction of intraocular pressure, or IOP, in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, or OAG, or ocular hypertension, or OHT;
●
the level of product sales from DEXTENZA and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future and the level of third-party reimbursement of such products;
●
the costs of sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization efforts with respect to DEXTENZA and any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the future, including cost increases due to inflation; 
●
the costs of scaling up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support sales of commercial products, clinical trials of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, and of expanding our facilities to accommodate this scale up and any corresponding growth in personnel; 
●
the extent of our debt service obligations and our ability, if desired, to refinance any of our existing debt on terms that are more favorable to us;
●
the amounts we are entitled to receive, if any, as reimbursements for clinical trial expenditures, development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments, and royalty payments under our license agreement with AffaMed;
●
the extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates; 
●
the costs and outcomes of any legal actions and proceedings;
●
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and 
●
the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies.
Conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, seeking market approvals and commercializing products are time-consuming, expensive and uncertain processes that take years to complete.  We may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval of products with the market potential sufficient to enable us to generate significant revenues from the sale of such products.  Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives.  Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or products or product candidates.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements, and marketing and distribution arrangements.  We do not have any committed external source of funds, although our license agreement with AffaMed provides for AffaMed’s reimbursement of certain clinical expenses incurred by us in connection with our collaboration and for our potential receipt of development and sales milestone payments and royalty payments.  To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, our securityholders’ ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing securityholders’ rights as holders or beneficial owners of our common stock.  Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as 
61

Table of Contents
incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.  Our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under the Barings Credit Facility pursuant to which we have a total borrowing capacity of $82.5 million, which has been fully drawn down, may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or other financing.  
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, royalty agreements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, products or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Our substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business or otherwise affect our operations.
Under the Barings Credit Facility, we have $82.5 million, net of unamortized discount and fees, of outstanding principal indebtedness. Under the Barings Credit Agreement, we are permitted to make payments of interest and fees only through August 2029, at which time we will be required to repay the full principal amount in addition to any outstanding interest and fees. In addition, we are obligated to pay a fee, which we refer to as the Royalty Fee, in an amount equal to $82.5 million, reduced by the total amount of interest and principal prepayment fees paid by us and subject to further potential reductions as specified in the Barings Credit Agreement. We are required to pay the Royalty Fee in installments to Barings, for the benefit of the lenders, on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the net sales of DEXTENZA occurring during such quarter, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations specified in the Barings Credit Agreement, until the Royalty Fee is paid in full. Any then remaining Royalty Fee is due and payable upon a change of control of the company. 
Our obligations under the Barings Credit Agreement are secured by all of our assets, including our intellectual property. The Barings Credit Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity amount of $20.0 million. We could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond this amount, including by potentially amending the Barings Credit Agreement. 
Our substantial debt combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant adverse consequences, including: 
●
requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt and related fees such as the Royalty Fee, which collectively reduce the amounts available to fund operating expenditures, including working capital, and capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control;
●
obligating us to additional negative covenants further restricting our activities;
●
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and
●
placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.
We intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated product revenue from DEXTENZA and funds from external sources. However, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
A failure to comply with the conditions of the Barings Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement. In an event of default, including upon the occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations, the amounts due under our Barings Credit Agreement could accelerate. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay 
62

our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments, and the lenders could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness.  
We hold our cash and cash equivalents that we use to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations, and capital expenditure requirements in deposit accounts that could be adversely affected if the financial institutions holding such funds fail.
We hold our cash and cash equivalents that we use to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations, and capital expenditure requirements in deposit accounts at two financial institutions. The balances held in these accounts typically exceed the standard deposit insurance limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. If a financial institution in which we hold such funds fails or is subject to significant adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, we could be subject to a risk of loss of all or a portion of our uninsured funds or be subject to a delay in accessing all or a portion of such funds. Any such loss or lack of access to these funds could adversely impact our short-term liquidity and ability to meet our operating expense, debt service, and capital expenditure obligations.
For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the FDIC was appointed as receiver. During this time, deposits held at SVB were temporarily inaccessible to SVB’s customers. At the time SVB was closed by its regulators, we maintained a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts with SVB.  
Our cash and cash equivalents remain concentrated in a small number of financial institutions. If any of the financial institutions in which we hold cash or cash equivalents were to fail in the future, we cannot provide any assurances that any governmental agencies would take action to protect or provide access to our uninsured deposits, or a third party would assume the failing financial institution’s obligations, in a similar manner as occurred in connection with the closure, receivership, and sale of SVB, and we may lose or be unable to access some or all of the uninsured funds we are holding at such financial institution.
We also maintain investment accounts with multiple financial institutions.  If our access to our cash and cash equivalents in our deposit accounts is impaired, we may not be able to open new operating accounts or to sell investments or transfer funds from our investment accounts to new operating accounts on a timely basis sufficient to meet our operating expense, debt service, and capital expenditure obligations.
We might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.
As of December 31, 2024, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $538.0 million and $385.2
 million, respectively.  The federal and state NOLs generated for annual periods prior to January 1, 2018 begin to expire in 2026. Our federal NOLs generated for the years ended on or after December 31, 2018, which amount to a total of $
412.2 million, can be carried forward indefinitely, although the deduction for such NOLs is limited to 80% of current year taxable income. As of December 31, 2024, we also had available research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $19.7 million and $11.8 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. These NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset our future income tax liabilities. Even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes because, among other reasons, federal tax rates and the rules governing NOL carryforwards might change; state NOLs generated in one state cannot be used to offset income generated in another state; and the use of NOL carryforwards might become subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions.

Risks Related to Product Development
Clinical trials of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates may not be successful. If clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be delayed or unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidate and our business may be harmed.
Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, including our lead product candidate AXPAXLI, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome.  A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.  The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later stage clinical trials, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results and results from one completed clinical trial may not be replicated in a subsequent clinical trial with a similar study design.  Some of our completed studies were conducted with small patient populations, making it difficult to predict whether the favorable results that we observed in such studies will be repeated in larger and more advanced clinical trials.  The sample size for later stage clinical trials, including for the SOL-1 and SOL-R trial, are determined based on certain assumptions regarding the efficacy of the product candidate under evaluation.  Even if a product candidate, such as AXPAXLI, is an effective treatment, a clinical trial may not meet its primary efficacy endpoint if the assumptions used to determine the trial sample size were not correct and therefore the trial is not adequately powered.  In addition, as product candidates advance in development, the number of clinical trial sites and investigators taking part in the trial will increase, particularly as product candidates enter pivotal studies.  New clinical sites or investigators who were not part of prior trials are likely to be unfamiliar with our protocols and product candidates and may introduce increased variability in product candidate administration and subject care throughout the trial. Some of our clinical trials also were conducted with different formulations than those that we are currently evaluating. For example, we are using a single optimized dose of AXPAXLI with a drug load of 450 µg of a more soluble form of axitinib in our SOL-1 and SOL-R trials, which is different than the formulation and dosage used in prior clinical trials for AXPAXLI, and intend to use the same formulation being used in the SOL-1 and SOL-R trials in future clinical trials of AXPAXLI. As we have not evaluated this formulation in earlier trials, it may not demonstrate the efficacy or safety profile that we anticipate.
Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.  The protocols for our clinical trials and other supporting information are subject to review by the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States. The FDA is not obligated to comment on our trial protocols, however, within any specified time-period or at all or to affirmatively clear or approve our planned pivotal clinical trials. Subject to a waiting period of 30 days for the initial IND submission, we could choose to initiate any clinical trial in the United States, including a pivotal clinical trial, without waiting for any additional period for comments from the FDA. Although the FDA may implicitly clear our clinical trial protocols or may provide comments regarding our development plans as part of a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement or other request for formal feedback, final determinations for marketing application approval are made after a complete review of a marketing application and are based on the entirety of the data in the new drug application. We are conducting our SOL-1 trial under an SPA agreement, as amended, agreed to by the FDA. An SPA agreement indicates concurrence by the FDA with the adequacy and acceptability of specific critical elements of the overall protocol design for a clinical trial intended to support a future marketing application, but it does not indicate FDA concurrence on every protocol detail. If we determine to deviate from the terms of the SPA agreement without the FDA’s concurrence, or if the FDA determines that we have deviated from the terms of the SPA agreement, the SPA agreement could be invalidated. Moreover, the FDA retains significant discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA agreement and the data and results from any trial that is the subject of an SPA agreement. An SPA agreement does not ensure the receipt of marketing approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, even if the clinical trial subject to the SPA agreement is successful or meets its primary endpoint, or that the approval process will be faster than conventional procedures.
We have devoted a significant portion of our financial resources and business efforts to the development of DEXTENZA and our product candidates.  We are currently investing substantial resources to advance the development of AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD. We currently have several ongoing clinical trials, including our SOL-1 and SOL-R trials, and our Phase 2 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA. We also continue to wind down our post-trial monitoring and surveillance obligations in the HELIOS trial, our Phase 1 clinical trial of AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR.
64

Table of Contents
We have, however, experienced the uncertainty of clinical trials in our own development programs.  In our Phase 2 clinical trial for our former product candidate OTX-CSI for the treatment of dry eye disease, for example, OTX-CSI did not meet the primary endpoint of the clinical trial.  
The trial was designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, durability, and efficacy of two different formulations of OTX-CSI by measuring signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in 140 subjects treated in both eyes over approximately 16 weeks (a 12-week study period, with an additional 4-week safety follow-up).  The four groups evaluated in this study were: OTX-CSI for a shorter duration, OTX-CSI for a longer duration, vehicle insert for a longer duration and vehicle insert for a very short duration. The study did not show separation between the OTX-CSI treated subjects (both formulations) and the vehicle treated subjects (both formulations) for the primary endpoint of increased tear production at 12 weeks as measured by the Schirmer’s Test.  
If clinical trials of AXPAXLI or any other product candidate that we develop fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce clear or favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidate.  We cannot accurately predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or whether our product candidates will receive marketing approval or reach successful commercialization.  Our ability to generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our development and commercialization of products with significant market potential.  
If we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates could be delayed or prevented.
We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize AXPAXLI or our other product candidates, including: 
●
clinical trials of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, in particular if investigator physicians do not follow the clinical trial protocol, including utilizing appropriate masking and rescue procedures for both the SOL-1 and SOL-R trial, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; 
●
the number of subjects required for clinical trials of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, in particular to establish clinically meaningful efficacy endpoints to a degree of statistical significance or to satisfy minimum FDA safety standards for AXPAXLI, including for repeat dosing;
●
enrollment and randomization in clinical trials for AXPAXLI may be slower than we anticipate on account of clinical trial sites’ inability to locate subjects meeting the eligibility criteria or competition at clinical trial sites for subjects who might otherwise be eligible to participate in other ongoing clinical trials sponsored by third-parties or from other clinical trials sponsored by third parties in other retinal disease areas, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; 
●
our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; 
●
regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; 
●
we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;
●
we may decide, or regulators or institutional review boards may require us, to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 
●
the cost of clinical trials of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and 
65

Table of Contents
●
the supply or quality of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.
From time to time, we may decide to conduct clinical trials to assess subjects’ clinical response to treatment and choose not to power such trials to measure the applicable efficacy endpoints with statistical significance, as we did in our Phase 2 clinical trials of our former product candidate OTX-TP for the treatment of OAG or OHT.  In addition, post-hoc analyses such as those that we performed on certain results of Phase 2 clinical trials of OTX-TP may not be predictive of success in future clinical trials, including as a result of differences in trial design.  Post-hoc analyses performed using an unlocked clinical trial database can also result in the introduction of bias and are given less weight by regulatory authorities than pre-specified analyses.  
The FDA may also require that New Drug Application, or NDA, submissions for our product candidates include pediatric data. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA, a biological licensing application, or BLA, or supplement to an NDA or BLA for certain drugs and biological products must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the sponsor receives a deferral or waiver from the FDA. The applicable legislation in the European Union also requires sponsors to either conduct clinical trials in a pediatric population in accordance with a Pediatric Investigation Plan approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA or to obtain a waiver or deferral from the conduct of these studies by this Committee. For any of our product candidates for which we are seeking regulatory approval in the United States or the European Union, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain a waiver or alternatively complete any required studies and other requirements in a timely manner, or at all, which could result in associated reputational harm and subject us to enforcement action.
Moreover, principal investigators for our future clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.
If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, such as the FDA’s requirement that we provide pediatric data for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery prior and for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in connection with the approval of our NDA for DEXTENZA for those indications, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or are only modestly favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may: 
●
be delayed in obtaining or unable to obtain marketing approval for AXPAXLI or our other product candidates; 
●
obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; 
●
obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings; 
●
be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or 
●
have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.  
Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals.  We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all.  Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.  
66

Table of Contents
If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and randomization of subjects in clinical trials of AXPAXLI or our other product candidates, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.
We may not be able to initiate or to continue clinical trials for AXPAXLI or our other product candidates, or other product candidates that we might develop, if we are unable to locate, enroll and randomize a sufficient number of eligible subjects to participate in these trials as required by the FDA, the EMA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.  Although there is a significant prevalence of disease in the areas of ophthalmology in which we are focused, we may nonetheless experience unanticipated difficulty with subject enrollment and randomization.  For example, in the third quarter of 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of PAXTRAVA outside the United States.  
After several months, after not enrolling any subjects, we closed this trial in the second quarter of 2018.  Additionally, we intended to initiate our Phase 1 clinical trial of AXPAXLI outside the United States in 2018, but delays in enrollment prevented us from dosing subjects until the first quarter of 2019.
A variety of factors affect subject enrollment and randomization of clinical trials, including: 
●
the prevalence and severity of the ophthalmic disease or condition under investigation; 
●
the design and eligibility criteria for the study in question; 
●
the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study; 
●
the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; 
●
the patient referral practices of physicians; 
●
the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; 
●
the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective subjects; 
●
actual or threatened public health emergencies or outbreaks of disease (including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic);
●
the conduct of clinical trials by competitors for product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidates or other indications that are treated by the same physicians who participate in our clinical trials; and
●
the lack of adequate compensation for prospective clinical trial sites or subjects.
In December 2022, with the passage of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan, or DAP, for each phase 3 clinical trial or any other "pivotal study" of a new drug product. These plans are meant to encourage enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. In June 2024, as mandated by FDORA, the FDA issued draft guidance outlining the general requirements for diversity action plans.  Unlike most guidance documents issued by the FDA, the diversity action plan guidance when finalized will have the force of law because FDORA specifically dictates that the form and manner for submission of DAPs are specified in FDA guidance. On January 27, 2025, in response to an Executive Order issued by President Trump on January 21, 2025, on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs, the FDA removed this draft guidance from its website.  This action raises questions about the applicability of statutory obligations to submit DAPs and the agency’s current thinking on best practices for clinical development.  If we are not able to adhere to these new requirements, to the extent they are adopted, our ability to conduct clinical trials may be delayed or halted.
Similarly, the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the European Union recently evolved. The CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized

process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. If we are not able to fulfill these new requirements, our ability to conduct clinical trials may be delayed or halted.
Delays can be more pronounced with later-stage clinical trials because they tend to be larger than early-stage trials.  For example, enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate DEXTENZA in pediatric subjects following cataract surgery, to fulfill FDA post-approval regulatory requirements, proceeded more slowly than we had anticipated due to the relative scarcity of pediatric cataract surgical subjects. In addition, we may experience delays in enrollment and randomization due to the design of our trials. For example, to qualify for randomization in the SOL-R trial, participants will only be eligible for randomization if they receive five aflibercept injections and have no significant retinal fluid fluctuations, in addition to satisfying other criteria.
Our inability to enroll and randomize a sufficient number of subjects in any of our clinical trials would result in significant delays, could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether and could delay or prevent our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.  Enrollment and randomization delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.
If serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of AXPAXLI or any other product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of such product candidates.
If AXPAXLI or any of our other product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.   
Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or early-stage testing for treating ophthalmic disease have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development or successful commercialization of the compound.  
As the number of subjects exposed to a product candidate or approved product increases, new safety signals undetectable in smaller patient populations may become apparent.  In addition, adverse events which had initially been considered unrelated to the study treatment may later be found to be caused by the study treatment.  
We may not be successful in our efforts to develop additional products and product candidates based on our proprietary bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology ELUTYX.
We are currently directing all of our development efforts towards applying our proprietary, bioresorbable hydrogel-based formulation technology ELUTYX to products and product candidates that are designed to provide local programmed-release hydrogel-based therapeutic agents to the eye. 
We have product candidates at mid and late stages of development based on ELUTYX and we may in the future explore the potential use of ELUTYX for other ophthalmic diseases and conditions.  
AXPAXLI and any other product candidates that we may develop based on ELUTYX may not be suitable for continued preclinical or clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.  If we do not successfully develop and commercialize products and product candidates that are based on ELUTYX beyond DEXTENZA, we will not be able to obtain substantial product revenues in future periods. 

We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications.  
As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.  In addition, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential of a target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.

We are currently prioritizing the advancement of AXPAXLI through Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of wet AMD. We also intend to meet with the FDA in the first half of 2025 to discuss the design of a potential registrational clinical program for AXPAXLI for the treatment of NPDR and DME and then evaluate our next steps. We are also focused on the continued commercialization of DEXTENZA and are determining our next steps for PAXTRAVA for the treatment of OAG or OHT. Although we believe our prioritization of resources is currently the best use of our resources, we may not be correct.  
We have conducted, and may in the future conduct, clinical trials for AXPAXLI and our other product candidates at sites outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.  
We have conducted, and may in the future choose to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. We are currently conducting the SOL-1 and SOL-R trials both inside and outside of the United States. We have often conducted our initial and earlier-stage clinical trials for our product candidates outside the United States, including our Phase 1 clinical trial for our product candidate AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD in Australia. 
Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA.  For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles.  The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful.  In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations.  If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and would delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidates.  Even if the FDA accepted such data, it could require us to modify our planned clinical trials to receive clearance to initiate such trials in the United States or to continue such trials once initiated.
Other risks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include: 
●
foreign regulatory requirements, differences in healthcare services, and differences in cultural customs that could restrict or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials; 
●
administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple sets of foreign regulations; 
●
foreign exchange fluctuations; 
●
diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and 
●
political and economic risks relevant to foreign countries.  
Risks Related to Commercialization 
We depend heavily on the success of DEXTENZA and any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI.  If we fail to commercialize these products successfully, our ability to generate significant product revenues and our business would be materially harmed.
The commercial success of DEXTENZA and any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, will depend on many factors, including the following: 
●
successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
●
applying for and receiving and maintaining marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 
●
scaling up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support commercialization efforts; 
69

Table of Contents
●
developing, validating and maintaining a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP; 
●
developing our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; 
●
partnering successfully with our current and future collaborators; 
●
gaining acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, competing effectively with other therapies, and obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 
●
maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following approval; and
●
protecting our intellectual property rights, including obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity.  
In certain cases, such as in our ongoing collaboration with AffaMed, many of these factors may be or are beyond our control, including clinical development and sales, marketing and distribution efforts.  
If we or our collaborators do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates, which would materially harm our business.  
Even though DEXTENZA has received marketing approval from the FDA and even if AXPAXLI or any of our other product candidates receives marketing approval, these products may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success, and the market opportunity for these products may be smaller than we estimate.
DEXTENZA or any of our product candidates that may receive marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, may fail to gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.  We commercially launched DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain in July 2019, and DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the first quarter of 2022, and we cannot yet accurately predict the extent to which DEXTENZA will gain broad market acceptance and become commercially successful, if at all.    
The degree of market acceptance of any of our products, or any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval, will depend on a number of factors, including: 
●
the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments; 
●
our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices, particularly in light of the lower cost of alternative treatments; 
●
the clinical indications for which the product is approved; 
●
the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments, including the retention rate for our intracanalicular insert product; 
●
the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 
●
the strength of our marketing and distribution support; 
●
timing of market introduction of competitive products; 
●
the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; 
70

Table of Contents
●
the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and 
●
any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.  
For example, we commercially launched ReSure Sealant, a topical liquid hydrogel that creates a temporary, adherent, soft and lubricious sealant to prevent post-surgical leakage from clear corneal incisions that are made during cataract surgery, in the United States in 2014. ReSure Sealant was only used in a minority of cataract surgeries, and we only received limited revenues from this product. In 2021, we suspended the production of ReSure Sealant. Furthermore, because we have not conducted any clinical trials to date comparing the effectiveness of DEXTENZA directly to currently approved alternative treatments for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery or ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, market acceptance of DEXTENZA could be less than if we had conducted such trials, and we may not be able to achieve the market share we anticipate.
Our assessment of the potential market opportunity for DEXTENZA and our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, is based on industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties.  Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information.  While we believe these industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently verified such data.  
If the actual market for DEXTENZA or any of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, is smaller than we expect, our product revenue may be limited and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.  
If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing DEXTENZA or any product candidates if and when they are approved, including AXPAXLI.
We have limited experience in the sale, marketing and distribution of drug and device products.  To achieve commercial success for DEXTENZA and any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, we will need to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either ourselves or through collaborations or other arrangements with third parties. We have built our own highly targeted, key account sales force for DEXTENZA that has focused primarily on ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs, responsible for the largest volumes of cataract surgery.
We believe that certain of our product candidates, if they are successfully developed and obtain marketing approval, would be used in ophthalmologists’ offices, similar to DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. We believe the office setting offers a unique set of potential challenges. If we do not succeed in adapting our marketing efforts to include the office setting, our ability to commercialize DEXTENZA or AXPAXLI, if approved, to its fullest potential or any future product candidates used in the office setting would be adversely affected.
Because we have not historically evaluated whether to seek regulatory approval for any of our products or product candidates outside of the United States, pending potential receipt of regulatory approval for the applicable product candidate in the United States, at this time we cannot be certain when, if ever, we will recognize revenue from commercialization of our products or product candidates in any international markets.  If we decide to commercialize our products outside of the United States, we expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize any product of ours that receives marketing approval.  
These may include independent distributors, pharmaceutical companies or our own direct sales organization.  For example, we intend to rely on AffaMed to commercialize DEXTENZA and PAXTRAVA, if approved for marketing, in specified jurisdictions in Asia in connection with our collaboration agreement with AffaMed.  
There are risks involved with both establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services.  We may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our products or may be unable to do so on terms that are most beneficial to us.  Such third parties may have interests that differ from ours.  We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to market, sell and distribute our products effectively.  Our product revenues and our profitability, if any, under third-party collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements may also be lower than if we were to sell, market and distribute a product ourselves.  On the other hand, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any

product launch.  If the commercial launch of any product or product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses.  This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.  
Other factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize products on our own include: 
●
our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; 
●
the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or lack of adequate number of physicians to use or prescribe our products; 
●
the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and 
●
unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.  
If we do not establish and maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing DEXTENZA or any of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI.
We are dependent upon a small number of specialty distributors and in-market customers for a significant portion of our DEXTENZA revenue, and the loss of or significant reduction in sales to these customers would adversely affect our results of operations.
We sell DEXTENZA in the United States primarily to a small number of specialty distributors, or SDs. These customers then subsequently resell DEXTENZA to ASCs, hospital outpatient departments, or HOPDs, and physicians’ offices, which we refer to as in-market customers when purchasing through the SD channel. We also sell DEXTENZA directly to a small population of ASCs and physicians’ offices, which we refer to as direct customers when purchasing through the direct sales channel. We are heavily dependent on a small number of SDs for our sales of DEXTENZA. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, three SDs accounted for a combined percentage of our total revenue of 77%, 85%, and 86%, respectively. We also experience significant concentration of sales at the in-market customer level. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, one in-market customer accounted for approximately 18%, 19%, and 3% of our gross sales of DEXTENZA before adjustments, respectively. A loss of a significant SD, direct customer, or in-market customer may result in a significant reduction in sales of DEXTENZA and would adversely affect our results of operations. We expect the significant SD concentration, as well as the significant concentration at the in-market customer level, to continue for the foreseeable future and a similar dynamic may develop for any future products we may commercialize, including AXPAXLI if approved. 
Our ability to generate and grow sales for DEXTENZA and any other product we may commercialize, including AXPAXLI if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our SDs are able to provide adequate distribution of these products, as well as the continued demand for DEXTENZA from our most significant in-market customers and direct customers. Although we believe we can find additional SDs, if necessary, and continue to broaden our base of direct customers, our revenue during any period of disruption of sales could suffer and we might incur additional costs. In addition, our SDs are responsible for a significant portion of our accounts receivables, net, balances. For example, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, three SDs accounted for 82% and 89% of our accounts receivables, net, balances, respectively. The loss of any significant SD or direct customer, or the loss of a significant in-market customer, a significant reduction in sales we make to them, any cancellation of orders they have made with us, or any failure to pay for the product we have sold to them could adversely affect our results of operations. Sales of DEXTENZA and any other product we may commercialize, including AXPAXLI if approved, may also be adversely impacted by vertical integration of private payor healthcare and insurance programs, health maintenance organizations, and pharmacy benefit managers, or further consolidation among the healthcare providers served or operated by our SDs if, for example, one or more consolidated groups of healthcare providers determines not to use, or decides to switch from, such marketed product in favor of a competing product.

We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.
The development and commercialization of new drug and device products is highly competitive.  We face competition with respect to our products and product candidates and will face competition with respect to any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
Our products and product candidates target markets that are already served by a variety of competing products based on a number of active pharmaceutical ingredients.  Many of these existing products have achieved widespread acceptance among physicians, patients and payors for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases and conditions.  In addition, many of these products are available on a generic basis, and our products and product candidates may not demonstrate sufficient additional clinical benefits to physicians, patients or payors to justify a higher price compared to generic products.  In many cases, insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, encourage the use of generic products.  As a result, our products face, and product candidates, if approved, will face, competition from drugs based on the same or similar active pharmaceutical ingredients but that are administered in a different manner, typically through eye drops or intravitreal injections.  
Because the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our products and product candidates are primarily available on a generic basis, or are soon to be available on a generic basis, competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products so long as these competitors do not infringe the patents that we license or own.  For example, our licensed patents related to our intracanalicular insert products and product candidates largely relate to the hydrogel composition of the intracanalicular inserts and certain drug-release features of the inserts.  As such, if a third party were able to design around the formulation and process patents that we license or own and create a different formulation using a different production process not covered by our licensed patents or patent applications, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing its product.  
Other companies have advanced into Phase 3 clinical development biodegradable, programmed-release drug delivery product candidates that could compete with our products and product candidates, including EyePoint Pharmaceuticals which initiated two Phase 3 trials of their product candidate DURAVYU for the treatment of wet AMD in 2024 and 4DMT which has announced plans to initiate two Phase 3 trials of their product candidate 4D-150 during 2025. Regeneron has also developed a treatment for wet AMD that requires re-dosing in up to 16-week intervals, marketed in the United States under the brand name Eylea HD. Multiple companies are in early-stage development to explore alternative means to deliver 
anti-
VEGF (anti-
vascular endothelial growth factors)
 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKI, products in an extended-delivery fashion to the back of the eye.  In addition, other companies are evaluating novel mechanisms of action for retinal diseases.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, are less expensive than our products or have better reimbursement.  Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.  
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do.  Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.  Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.  These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, manufacturing, marketing, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

DEXTENZA and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage or reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.
Our ability to commercialize DEXTENZA or any product candidates that we may develop successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government healthcare programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other organizations.  Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.  A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment.  Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications.  Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug and device companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products.  
Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for DEXTENZA or any other product that we may commercialize after obtaining marketing approval, including AXPAXLI.  Even if coverage and reimbursement are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.  
Inadequate reimbursement may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, DEXTENZA or any product candidate, including AXPAXLI, for which we obtain marketing approval.  Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult.  We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies.  If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize DEXTENZA or any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI.  
There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and devices, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.  Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses.  Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent.  Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.  Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.  Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies.  Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any FDA-approved products that we develop would compromise our ability to generate revenues and become profitable.  
The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug and device products vary widely from country to country.  Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals.  Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed.  In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted.  In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted.  As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.  To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidate to other available therapies.  Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more products or product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.  
DEXTENZA or any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval in the United States or in other countries, including AXPAXLI, may not be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, may not be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, coverage and an adequate level of reimbursement may not be available, and reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect our ability to sell our

Table of Contents
products and product candidates profitably.  
DEXTENZA, for example, is currently considered a post-surgical product, in the same fashion as eye drops.  However, if DEXTENZA were instead categorized as an intra-operative product, it would not be subject to separate reimbursement in ASCs and hospital out-patient departments, or HOPDs, which could limit its market acceptance. 
CMS evaluates the eligibility of products such as DEXTENZA for separate payment annually, and there can be no assurance that CMS will not change the criteria applicable to non-opioid pain management drugs for 2025 or beyond.  If DEXTENZA is no longer eligible for reimbursement separately from ophthalmic surgery in the ASC setting, due to the loss of pass-through status or otherwise, our net product revenues, which currently consist primarily of DEXTENZA sales in reliance on separate reimbursement through pass-through status, would decline significantly, and our ability to generate revenues from future sales of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain would be adversely affected.
CMS has also established the fixed reimbursement amount for Category I Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code 68841, the procedure code for the insertion of DEXTENZA.  As this fee schedule is lower than reimbursement many physicians received under the prior Category III CPT code for DEXTENZA, physicians may have less incentive to use DEXTENZA and, as a result, our ability to continue to commercialize DEXTENZA may decrease.  Additionally, CMS will review such determination as part of its annual rulemaking cycle, and such amount could be further reduced in the future. Physicians’ desire to use DEXTENZA could also be adversely impacted if competitive products secure higher procedure payments for their use than DEXTENZA.
There are no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining reimbursement for DEXTENZA or of obtaining or maintaining reimbursement for any products or product candidates for which we might receive marketing approval in the future, including AXPAXLI. 
Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we develop.
We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of our product candidates that we develop in human clinical trials, including AXPAXLI. We face an even greater risk for any products we develop and commercially sell or have sold, including DEXTENZA and ReSure Sealant. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities.  Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 
●
decreased demand for any products or product candidates that we develop; 
●
injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; 
●
withdrawal of clinical trial participants; 
●
significant costs to defend the related litigation; 
●
substantial monetary awards to trial participants or subjects; 
●
loss of revenue; 
●
reduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy; and 
●
the inability to commercialize any products that we develop.  
We currently hold product liability insurance coverage; however these policies may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur and we may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials of AXPAXLI and our sales of DEXTENZA and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.

Risks Related to Manufacturing 
​
If one of our manufacturing facilities is damaged or destroyed or production at any facility is otherwise interrupted, our business and prospects would be negatively affected.
​
We manufacture devices and drug products for use in our clinical trials for our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, in a single-site facility, and we manufacture devices and drug products for DEXTENZA in a separate single-site facility. If one of our manufacturing facilities or the equipment in it is damaged or destroyed, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity or replace it at all.  In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of a facility or equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to another facility or to a third party. Even if we could transfer our manufacturing to another facility or a third party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since any new facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements and to be inspected and qualified. We would also need FDA approval before any products manufactured at that facility could be used for commercial supply. In the case of any disruption in our manufacturing operations at a facility, we may not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our clinical trial requirements or of our product inventory to meet our commercial requirements. Such an event could delay our clinical trials or, particularly because we have sought to adopt just-in-time manufacturing practices and maintain limited commercial product inventory with our distributors, reduce our product sales. 
Currently, we maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment and to cover business interruption and research and development restoration expenses.  However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses we may suffer.  We may be unable to meet our requirements for DEXTENZA or any of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, if there were a catastrophic event or failure of our current manufacturing facilities or processes.  
We will need to upgrade and expand our manufacturing facilities or relocate to another facility and to augment our manufacturing personnel and processes in order to meet our business plans. If we fail to do so, we may not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates to meet our commercial and clinical trial requirements.
In order to meet our business plan, which contemplates our scaling up of our manufacturing processes to support the development and potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates, including AXPAXLI, and maintain the manufacturing capacity necessary to support the commercialization of DEXTENZA, we will need to upgrade and expand our existing manufacturing facilities, or relocate to one or more other manufacturing facilities; add manufacturing, quality and support personnel; ensure that new processes, systems, and facilities are qualified and validated; and ensure that any new processes and systems are consistently implemented in our facility or facilities.  The upgrade and expansion of our facilities, or our relocation to one or more alternate facilities, will require additional regulatory approvals including FDA audits of such new processes, systems, and facilities.  In addition, it will be costly and time-consuming to expand our facilities or relocate and recruit necessary additional personnel.  If we are unable to expand our manufacturing facilities or relocate in compliance with regulatory requirements or to hire additional necessary manufacturing personnel, we may encounter delays or additional costs in achieving our research, development and commercialization objectives, including obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates and meeting customer demand for our products, which could materially damage our business and financial position.
We must comply with federal, state and foreign regulations, including quality standards applicable to medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as cGMP, which are enforced by the FDA through means including its facilities inspection program and system audits and by similar regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business.  These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality systems and the maintenance of records and documentation.  
For example, between March 2015 and May 2018, we received multiple Form 483s from the FDA containing inspectional observations relating to inadequate procedures for documenting follow-up information pertinent to the investigation of complaints and for evaluation of complaints for adverse event reporting; process controls, analytical testing and physical security procedures related to manufacture of our drug product for stability and commercial production purposes; and procedures for manufacturing processes and analytical testing related to the manufacture of drug product for commercial production.  In each of July 2016 and July 2017, we also received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA pertaining to, among other things, the deficiencies in manufacturing processes, controls, and analytical testing identified during pre-NDA approval inspections of our manufacturing facility documented on Form 483s. We may be subject to similar inspections, audits

and other requirements in connection with subsequent applications for other product candidates or in connection with periodic, routine surveillance for products for which we have received marketing authorization.
The FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities at any time also may implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards, for the manufacture, packaging or testing of our products.  Any failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, product seizure or recall, imposition of a consent decree, or withdrawal of product approval, and would limit the availability of DEXTENZA and our product candidates that we manufacture.  
Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in significant consequences, including costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims.  
We expect to continue to contract with third parties for at least some aspects of the production of our products and product candidates. We also depend from time to time on single-source suppliers for certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates.  This increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.
We currently rely on third parties for some aspects of the production of DEXTENZA and our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, for commercialization and preclinical testing and clinical trials.  While we expect that our existing manufacturing facilities, or any expansions of our existing facilities or additional facilities that we might build, will be sufficient to meet our requirements for manufacturing DEXTENZA and any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI, we may in the future need to rely on third-party manufacturers for some aspects of the manufacture of our products or product candidates.  
We also depend on single-source suppliers for certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates, including our supply of polyethylene glycol, or PEG, the molecule that forms the basis of our hydrogels, and other raw materials of our products and product candidates and for sterilization and packaging of the finished product.  We do not have any long-term supply agreements in place for the clinical or commercial supply of any drug substances or raw materials for DEXTENZA or any of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI. 
We purchase drug substance and raw materials, including the chemical constituents for our hydrogel, from independent suppliers on a purchase order basis.  We cannot ensure that our suppliers will remain in business, have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to work with us. Our use of single-source suppliers of raw materials and other components used in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates could expose us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases or late deliveries.  Any performance failure or refusal to supply drug substance or raw materials on the part of our existing or future suppliers could delay clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our products.  If our current suppliers do not perform as we expect, we may be required to replace one or more of these suppliers. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers could take a substantial amount of time, and it may be difficult to establish replacement suppliers who meet our quality standards and applicable regulatory requirements. For example, we depend on a sole source supplier for the supply of our PEG.  This sole source supplier may be unwilling or unable to supply PEG to us reliably, continuously and at the levels we anticipate or are required by the market.  Although we believe that there are a number of potential long-term replacements to our suppliers, including our PEG supplier, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements.  
Reliance on third parties for aspects of the supply of our products and product candidates entails additional risks, including: 
●
reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; 
●
the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; 
●
the possible breach of an agreement by the third party; and 
●
the possible termination or nonrenewal of an agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.

Table of Contents
Third-party suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to comply with our specifications, quality assurance standards, cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States.  Our failure, or the failure of our third parties, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and product candidates. Further, reliance on third-party suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.  
Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties
We have entered into collaborations with third parties to develop certain product candidates, and in the future 
we may enter into additional collaborations for the development or commercialization of our product candidates. We may also enter into collaboration, distribution or marketing arrangements for the commercialization of DEXTENZA or any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI.  If our collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these products or product candidates.
We have in the past entered into collaboration agreements with third parties, including our collaboration with AffaMed, and expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize DEXTENZA, or any of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, for which we may obtain marketing approval in markets outside the United States.  We also may enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services in the United States if we do not establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in the United States for such products or if we determine that such third-party arrangements are otherwise beneficial. We also may seek additional third-party collaborators for development and commercialization of product candidates, including AXPAXLI and PAXTRAVA. Our likely collaborators for any sales, marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies.  Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.  
Our collaboration with AffaMed poses, and any future collaborations likely will pose, a number of risks including the following: 
●
collaborators have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations; 
●
collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected; 
●
collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products or product candidates that receive marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on results of clinical trials or other studies, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities; 
●
collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;
●
collaborators could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings or other similar arrangements which may result in us having to return funds that we previously received, or in collaborators selling or transferring product licenses to other parties;
●
collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours; 
78

Table of Contents
●
product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates; 
●
a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; 
●
disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of products or product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to products or product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would divert management attention and resources, be time-consuming and expensive; 
●
collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; 
●
collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and 
●
collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable products or product candidates.  
Collaboration agreements may not lead to the development or commercialization of products or product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all.  If any collaborations that we enter into do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration.  If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, or if we are required to return previously received funds, or if product licenses are sold or transferred to another party as a result of a collaborators’ bankruptcy, our development of our products or product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our products or product candidates.  
For example, our former collaborator Regeneron terminated our collaboration in August 2021.  As a result of the termination, we were relieved of obligations to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs, up to an aggregate amount of $30.0 million in certain circumstances, were Regeneron to exercise its option but also ceased to be eligible to receive (i) reimbursement from Regeneron for ongoing research and development activities, (ii) a fee upon exercise of its option, (iii) payments upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones of the products developed under the collaboration, or (iv) tiered, escalating royalties on such products.  All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this periodic report also apply to the activities of our collaborators.  
Additionally, if a collaborator terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.
If we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans and our business could be adversely affected.
For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, such as our collaboration with AffaMed for the development and commercialization of DEXTENZA and PAXTRAVA in specified territories in Asia.  We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators.  Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors.  Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to subjects, the potential of competing products, and industry and market conditions generally.  The collaborator may also consider 
79

Table of Contents
alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate.  We may also be restricted under current or future license and collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators.   In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. 
 If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay one or more development programs, or limit potential commercialization activities.  If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform.  
Although the majority of our clinical development is administered and managed by our own employees, we have relied, and may continue to rely, on third parties for certain aspects of our clinical development, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.
Our employees have administered and managed most of our clinical development work to date.  However, we also utilize third parties, such as CROs, to conduct clinical trials of certain of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI for the treatment of wet AMD, NPDR, and DME and PAXTRAVA for the treatment of OAG or OHT, and we may continue to do so.  If we deem necessary, we may engage additional third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct or assist in our clinical trials or other clinical development work.  If we are unable to enter into an agreement with a CRO or other service provider when required, our product development activities could be delayed.  
Our reliance on third parties for research and development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities.  For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials, including the SOL-1 and the SOL-R trials, is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial.  Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected, even if a third party is administering certain activities.  For example, in May 2020, we disclosed the receipt of interim data regarding our Phase 1 clinical trial of AXPAXLI, in Australia, for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. We discovered, however, that our disclosures did not include complete information when we became aware in July 2020 that a clinical trial site had not entered certain data concerning these subjects into the clinical trial database in a timely manner. If we engage third parties and they do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.  
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
We may be unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or the scope of the patent protection obtained may not be sufficiently broad, such that our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.
Our success depends in large part on our and our licensor’s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products.  We and our licensor have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies, products and product candidates.  Our licensed and owned patent portfolio that we believe is integral to our business includes patents with terms that extend from 2025 to 2041. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, we may have a reduced patent exclusivity period upon approval.  The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not have filed or prosecuted and may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.  It is also possible that we have failed, or may in the future fail, to identify patentable aspects of our research and development efforts before it is too late to obtain patent protection.

In some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to enforce or maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties.  In particular, the license agreement that we have entered into with Incept LLC, or Incept, an intellectual property holding company, which covers a significant portion of the patent rights and the technology for DEXTENZA, ReSure Sealant and our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, provides that, with limited exceptions, Incept has sole control and responsibility for ongoing prosecution for  certain  patents covered by the license agreement.  In addition, although we have a right under the Incept license to bring suit against third parties who infringe such licensed patents in our fields, other Incept licensees may also have the right to enforce these patents in their own respective fields without our oversight or control.  Those other licensees may choose to enforce our licensed patents in a way that harms our interest, for example, by advocating for claim interpretations or agreeing on invalidity positions that conflict with our positions or our interest.  For example, three of our licensed patents related to ReSure Sealant were invalidated and rendered unenforceable following their assertion by Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, another licensee of Incept. We also have no right to control the defense of such licensed patents if their validity or scope is challenged before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or other patent office or tribunal.  In such instances, we would be required to rely on our licensor to defend such challenges, and our licensor may not do so in a way that would best protect our interests.  Therefore, certain of our licensed patents and applications may not be prosecuted, enforced, defended or maintained in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.  If Incept fails to prosecute, enforce or maintain such patents, or loses rights to those patents, our licensed patent portfolio may be reduced or eliminated.  
The patent position of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation.  As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights, including our licensed patent rights, are highly uncertain.  Our and our licensor’s pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products
Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all.  Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensor were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.  Databases for patents and publications, and methods for searching them, are inherently limited so it is not practical to review and know the full scope of all issued and pending patent applications.  As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our licensed and owned patent rights are uncertain.  Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products.  Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.  
Patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.  The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law.  These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation.  The USPTO developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013.  The first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor to patent an invention if not the first to file an application for patenting that invention, even if such invention was the first invention.  Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business.  However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.  For example, the Leahy-Smith Act provides an administrative tribunal known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board, or PTAB, that provides a venue for companies to challenge the validity of competitor patents at a cost that is much lower than district court litigation and on timelines that are much faster.  Although it is not clear what, if any, long term impact the PTAB proceedings will have on the operation of our business, the results of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have resulted in the invalidation of many U.S. patent claims.  The availability of the PTAB as a lower-cost, faster and potentially more potent tribunal for challenging patents could therefore increase the likelihood that our own licensed and owned patents will be challenged, thereby increasing the uncertainties and costs of maintaining and enforcing them.  Moreover, if such 
81

Table of Contents
challenges occur, as indicated above, we have no right to control the defense of our licensed portfolio.  Instead, we would rely on our licensor to consider our suggestions and to defend such challenges, with the possibility that it may not do so in a way that best protects our interests.  
We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in other contested proceedings such as opposition, derivation, reexamination,
 inter partes
 review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others.  An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.  In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products.  
In the United States, the FDA does not prohibit physicians from prescribing an approved product for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling.  Although use of a product directed by off-label prescriptions may infringe our method-of-treatment patents, the practice is common across medical specialties, particularly in the United States, and such infringement is difficult to detect, prevent or prosecute.  In addition, patents that cover methods of use for a medical device cannot be enforced against the party that uses the device, but rather only against the party that makes them.  Such indirect enforcement is more difficult to achieve.
The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our licensed and owned patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad.  Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products.   
Because the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our products and product candidates are primarily available on a generic basis, or are soon to be available on a generic basis, competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products so long as these competitors do not infringe our patents or any patents that we license.  These patents largely relate to the hydrogel composition and drug-release design scheme of our products.  As such, if a third party were able to design around the formulation and process patents that we license and own and create a different formulation using a different production process not covered by our patents or patent applications, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing its product.  
If we are not able to obtain patent term extensions in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for our product and product candidates, our business may be impaired.
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such product candidates or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act.  The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA-approved product.  Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates.  Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements.  Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request. 
Further, our license from Incept does not provide us with the right to control decisions by Incept or its other licensees on Orange Book listings or patent term extension decisions under the Hatch-Waxman Act.  Thus, if one of our important licensed patents is eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, and it covers a product of another Incept licensee in addition to our own product candidate, we may not be able to obtain that extension if the other licensee seeks and obtains that extension first. 
If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our 
82

Table of Contents
competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration sooner, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially. 
We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our licensed and owned patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.
Competitors may infringe our licensed or owned patents or other intellectual property.  As a result, to counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming.  Under the terms of our license agreement with Incept, we have the right to initiate suit against third parties who we believe infringe on the patents subject to the license.  Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents.  In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent we have rights to is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.  An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.  Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.  
Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.
Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.  We may become party to, or threatened with, infringement litigation claims regarding our products and technology, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect.  Moreover, we may become party to future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding our patent portfolio or the patents of third parties.  Such proceedings could also include contested post-grant proceedings such as oppositions,
 inter partes
 review, reexamination, interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO or foreign patent offices.  The legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings is low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated and require significant resources to defend.  Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our licensor can.  The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our products or product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company.  Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.  We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our products or product candidates and their uses, or we may incorrectly determine that a patent is invalid or does not cover a particular product or product candidate.  Thus, we do not know with certainty that any of our products or product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party’s intellectual property.  
We have been made aware by a third party of patents relating to intracanalicular inserts that may relate to, and potentially could be asserted against, our intracanalicular insert product and product candidates, including DEXTENZA. We believe that DEXTENZA does not infringe any claims of these patents. We also believe that such claims, if and to the extent they were asserted against our product candidates, would be subject to claims of invalidity.  We initiated legal proceedings against one of these patents and administrative proceedings against the other two patents in order to show that DEXTENZA does not infringe the claims of these patents or that these patents are invalid.  Legal proceedings related to one of these patents has been dismissed by agreement of the parties without prejudice.  The USPTO decided to proceed with the administrative proceeding related to one of the patents while declining to do so for the other after determining that we had not established a reasonable likelihood that we would prevail in establishing the unpatentability of certain claims.  In June 2020, for the patent for which the USPTO decided to proceed with administrative proceedings, the PTAB, after an 
inter partes
 review, determined that we had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that all claims of the patent at issue held by such third party were invalid. The third party appealed this decision, and in November 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the holding of the PTAB.  The period during which such third party may appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals has lapsed. We continue to believe that DEXTENZA does not infringe the claims of these patents and that, if and to the extent it were asserted against DEXTENZA, such patent would be subject to a claim of invalidity.  We have become aware that the USPTO has 
83

Table of Contents
recently issued a patent filed by this third party related to intracanalicular inserts containing dexamethasone. If this patent were asserted against DEXTENZA or other of our product candidates, we believe such patent would be non-infringed and subject to a claim of invalidity.
If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to cease manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product or product candidate or to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product containing such technology. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent and could be forced to indemnify our customers or collaborators. A finding of infringement could also result in an injunction that prevents us from commercializing our products or product candidates or forces us to cease some of our business operations. In addition, we may be forced to redesign our products or product candidates, seek new regulatory approvals thereby causing delays, and indemnify third parties pursuant to contractual agreements. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.
If we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.
Our license agreement with Incept, under which we license certain portions of our patent rights and the technology for our products and product candidates, imposes royalty and other financial obligations and other substantial performance obligations on us.  We also may enter into additional licensing and funding arrangements with third parties that may impose diligence, development and commercialization timelines and milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us.  If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future license and collaboration agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to manufacture or market any product that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under the agreements.  Such an occurrence could diminish the value of our product.  Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.  
Under the terms of our license agreement with Incept, we have agreed to assign to Incept our rights in certain patent applications filed at any time in any country for which one or more inventors are under an obligation of assignment to us.  These assigned patent applications and any resulting patents are included within the specified patents owned or controlled by Incept to which we receive a license under the agreement.  Incept has retained rights to practice the patents and technology licensed to us under the agreement for all purposes other than for researching, designing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing products that are delivered to or around the human eye for diagnostic, therapeutic or prophylactic purposes relating to ophthalmic diseases or conditions.  As a result, termination of our agreement with Incept, based on our failure to comply with this or any other obligation under the agreement, would cause us to lose a significant portion of our rights to important intellectual property or technology upon which our business depends.  Additionally, the field limit of the license and the requirement that we assign to Incept our rights in certain patent applications may restrict our ability to use certain of our licensed rights to expand our business outside of the specified fields.  If we determine to pursue a strategy of expanding the use of the hydrogel technology outside of the specified fields, we would need to negotiate and enter into an amendment to our existing license agreement with Incept or a new license agreement with Incept covering one or more additional such fields of use or utilize technologies that do not infringe on such licensed rights.  We may not be able to obtain any such required amendment or new license or to invent or otherwise access other technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.
Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology, medical device or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors.  Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other 
84

Table of Contents
proprietary information, of any such employee’s former employer.  Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.  
In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, such agreements may be ineffective, or such agreements may be breached by our counterparty.  
If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.    
Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.
Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities.  In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.  Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.  We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately.  Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources.  Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.  
If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.
In addition to seeking patents for our technology, products and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position.  We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties.  We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants.  Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.  Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.  In addition, some courts are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.  If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us.  If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. 

If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic versions of our current commercial product or any of our future drug products that receive marketing approval through the NDA pathway, or such authorities do not grant such future products appropriate periods of data exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, our sales could be adversely affected.
Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a “reference-listed drug” in the FDA’s publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” commonly known as the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference-listed drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference-listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference-listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference-listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower 
85

Table of Contents
prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference-listed drug is typically lost to the generic product.
The FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference-listed drug has expired. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains an active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. This interpretation was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a patent covering the reference-listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference-listed drug. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. 
Generic drug manufacturers may seek to launch generic products following the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period we obtain if our product candidates are approved, even if we still have patent protection for such product candidates. Competition that any such product candidates of ours may face from generic versions of such products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we may make in those product candidates.
Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters
Even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we or any current or future collaborator of ours is not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we or they will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.
The activities associated with the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, including design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and by the EMA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.  Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate.  We have only received approval to market DEXTENZA and ReSure Sealant for specified indications in the United States.  We have not received approval to market DEXTENZA or ReSure Sealant in any jurisdiction outside the United States or to market any of our product candidates anywhere If we are unable to obtain a CE Certificate of Conformity for any of our products or product candidates for which we seek European regulatory approval, we will be prohibited from commercializing such product or products in the European Union and other places which require the CE Certificate of Conformity.  In such a case, the potential market to commercialize our products may be significantly smaller than we currently estimate.  
The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, if approval is obtained at all.  Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and purity.  Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities.  The FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not safe or effective, are only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.  
Moreover, principal investigators for our future clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a 
86

Table of Contents
conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.
As part of its review of the NDA for DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular pain, the FDA completed inspections of three sites from our two completed Phase 3 clinical trials for compliance with the study protocol and Good Clinical Practices as well as two inspections of our manufacturing facility.  The FDA identified several deficiencies and issued us multiple Forms 483s and two CRLs, each of which delayed our development and commercialization efforts. We may be subject to similar inspections in the future for any of our products and product candidates.   
Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.  The FDA, the EMA and regulatory authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.  In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate.  Any marketing approval we or any current or future collaborator of ours ultimately obtains may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.    
Accordingly, if we or any current or future collaborator of ours experiences delays in obtaining approval or if we or they fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.  
Even if we, or any current or future collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals, ongoing regulations and post-marketing restrictions for our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.
Once marketing approval has been granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation.  
Manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs applicable to drug and biologic manufacturers or quality assurance standards applicable to medical device manufacturers, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements.  We, any contract manufacturers we may engage in the future, our current or future collaborators and their contract manufacturers will also be subject to other regulatory requirements, including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians, recordkeeping, and costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product such as the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.  
Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate.  For example, the FDA required two post-approval studies as a condition for approval of our premarket approval application for ReSure Sealant, the last of which the FDA confirmed was complete in April 2021.  The studies were expensive, required extensive communication and coordination with the FDA, and took more than five years to complete.  The FDA also has required us to conduct a clinical trial of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain and for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in pediatric populations in accordance with the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003.
Certain endpoint data we hope to include in any approved product labeling also may not make it into such labeling, including exploratory or secondary endpoint data such as patient-reported outcome measures. The FDA may also require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could entail requirements for long-term patient follow-up, a medication guide, physician 
87

Table of Contents
communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA, EMA or a comparable non-U.S. regulatory authority approves our product candidates, we will have to comply with requirements including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and registration. 
The FDA may impose consent decrees or withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-marketing studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
●
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 
●
fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials; 
●
refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals; 
●
product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and 
●
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
In addition, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business, we may be subject to sanctions, including the temporary or permanent suspension of operations, product recalls, marketing restrictions, and civil and criminal penalties. 
In addition, we could be adversely affected by several significant administrative law cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024. In 
Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo
, for example, the court overruled 
Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc
., which for 40 years required federal courts to defer to permissible agency interpretations of statutes that are silent or ambiguous on a particular topic. The U.S. Supreme Court stripped federal agencies of this presumptive deference and held that courts must exercise their independent judgment when deciding whether an agency such as the FDA acted within its statutory authority under the Administrative Procedure Act, or the APA. Additionally, in 
Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
, the court held that actions to challenge a federal regulation under the APA can be initiated within six years of the date of injury to the plaintiff, rather than the date the rule is finalized. The decision appears to give prospective plaintiffs a personal statute of limitations to challenge longstanding agency regulations. Another decision, 
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy
, overturned regulatory agencies’ ability to impose civil penalties in administrative proceedings. These decisions could introduce additional uncertainty into the regulatory process and may result in additional legal challenges to actions taken by federal regulatory agencies, including the FDA and CMS, that we rely on. In addition to potential changes to regulations as a result of legal challenges, these decisions may result in increased regulatory uncertainty and delays and other impacts, any of which could adversely impact our business and operations.
​
Further, our ability to develop and market new drug products may be impacted by litigation challenging the FDA’s approval of another company’s drug product. In April 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas invalidated the approval by the FDA of mifepristone, a drug product which was originally approved in 2000 and whose distribution is governed by various measures adopted under a REMS. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declined to order the removal of mifepristone from the market but did hold that plaintiffs were likely to prevail in their claim that changes allowing for expanded access of mifepristone, which the FDA authorized in 2016 and 2021, were arbitrary and capricious. In June 2024, the Supreme Court reversed that decision after unanimously finding that the plaintiffs (anti-
88

Table of Contents
abortion doctors and organizations) did not have standing to bring this legal action against the FDA. On October 11, 2024, the Attorneys General of three states (Missouri, Idaho and Kansas) filed an amended complaint in the district court in Texas challenging FDA’s actions. On January 16, 2025, the district court agreed to allow these states to file an amended complaint and continue to pursue this challenge.  Depending on the outcome of this litigation, our ability to develop new drug product candidates and to maintain approval of existing drug products could be delayed, undermined or subject to protracted litigation.
Finally, with the change in presidential administrations in 2025, there is substantial uncertainty as to how, if at all, the new administration will seek to modify or revise the requirements and policies of the FDA and other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our product candidates. The impending uncertainty could present new challenges or potential opportunities as we navigate the clinical development and approval process for our product candidates. 
Accordingly, in connection with our currently approved products and assuming we, or any current or future collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and any current or future collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control.  If we, and any current or future collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we, and any current or future collaborators, could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our, or any current or future collaborators’, ability to market any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.  Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.  
Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies’ operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business. 
The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 
Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. In addition, disruptions may result from events similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA’s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. In the event of a similar public health emergency in the future, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and review timelines could be extended. Regulatory authorities outside the United States facing similar circumstances may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to a similar public health emergency and may also experience delays in their regulatory activities. 
Accordingly, if a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future shutdowns or other disruptions could also affect other government agencies such as the SEC, which may also impact our business by delaying review of our public filings, to the extent such review is necessary, and our ability to access the public markets.

We may be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products.
Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control and manufacturing, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. In addition, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Accordingly, if we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.
Notwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific communications concerning their products in certain circumstances. For example, in January 2025, the FDA published final guidance outlining the agency’s non-binding policies governing the distribution of scientific information on unapproved uses to healthcare providers. This final guidance calls for such communications to be truthful, non-misleading, factual, and unbiased and include all information necessary for healthcare providers to interpret the strengths and weaknesses and validity and utility of the information about the unapproved use. In addition, under some relatively recent guidance from the FDA and the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act, or PIE Act, signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, companies may also promote information that is consistent with the prescribing information and proactively speak to formulary committee members of payors regarding data for an unapproved drug or unapproved uses of an approved drug. We may engage in these discussions and communicate with healthcare providers, payors and other constituencies in compliance with all applicable laws, regulatory guidance and industry best practices. We will need to carefully navigate the FDA’s various regulations, guidance and policies, along with recently enacted legislation, to ensure compliance with restrictions governing promotion of our products. 
In recent years, a significant number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including the Department of Justice and various U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have alleged violations of various federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and anti-kickback laws and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. Many of these investigations originate as “
qui tam
” actions under the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, any individual can bring a claim on behalf of the government alleging that a person or entity has presented a false claim or caused a false claim to be submitted to the government for payment. The person bringing a 
qui tam
 suit is entitled to a share of any recovery or settlement. 
Qui tam 
suits, also commonly referred to as “whistleblower suits,” are often brought by current or former employees. In a 
qui tam 
suit, the government must decide whether to intervene and prosecute the case. If it declines, the individual may pursue the case alone.
Similar restrictions apply to the approval of our products in the European Union. The holder of a marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, which can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations; the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory; and the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, which are strictly regulated in the European Union. and are also subject to EU Member State laws. The failure to comply with these and other requirements of the European Union can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.

Violations of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription products may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.  Failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:
●
restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes; 
●
restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product; 
●
restrictions on product distribution or use of a product; 
●
requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; 
●
warning letters or untitled letters; 
●
withdrawal of the products from the market; 
●
refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; 
●
recall of products; 
●
fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; 
●
suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; 
●
refusal to permit the import or export of our products; 
●
product seizure or detention; 
●
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; 
●
damage to relationships with any potential collaborators; 
●
unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation; or 
●
litigation involving patients using our products.  
Similar restrictions apply to the approval of our products in the European Union. The holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. 
Our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription and use of our products and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.  Our future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval.  Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 
●
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or 
91

Table of Contents
reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
●
the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties; 
●
the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
●
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
●
the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered products to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals; and 
●
analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.  
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require product manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.  State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.  
If our operations or the operations of our present and future collaborators are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us or them, we or they may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our or their financial results. We are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program designed to ensure that we will market and sell any future products that we successfully develop from our product candidates in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.  If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.  
Efforts to ensure that our business with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to improve our healthcare compliance program and establish a more robust compliance infrastructure. We may fail to establish appropriate compliance measures, and even with a stronger program in place, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.

The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in other jurisdictions. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States and the UK Bribery Act 2010. Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed and often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Current and future legislation or executive actions may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any current or future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our products or product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any drugs for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved drugs.  If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope, our business could be materially harmed.
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the CARES Act  
The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our products or product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product is prescribed or used. Under current legislation, the actual reductions in Medicare payments may vary up to 4%.
Since enactment of the ACA, there have been and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019.  Further, on June 17, 2021,the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed an action to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA after finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the legal action. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
We expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop or commercialize product candidates.

The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are subject to considerable legislative and executive actions and could impact the prices we obtain for our products, if and when licensed.
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products
In addition, in October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 
804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. Seven states (Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico,  Texas and Vermont) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada.  
North Dakota  and Virginia  have passed legislation establishing workgroups to examine the impact of a state importation program. As of May 2024, five states (Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire and New Mexico) had 
submitted Section 804 Importation Program proposals to the  FDA and, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida’s plan for Canadian drug importation. 
That state now has authority to import certain drugs from Canada for a period of two years once certain conditions are met. Florida will first need to submit a pre-import request for each drug selected for importation, which must be approved by the FDA. The state will also need to relabel the drugs and perform quality testing of the products to meet FDA standards.
Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, was signed into law by President Biden.  The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025).  The IRA permits the Secretary of the HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.  
Specifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D.  CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond.  This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition.  Nonetheless, since CMS may establish a maximum price for these products in price negotiations, we would be fully at risk of government action if our products were to become the subject of Medicare price negotiations.  Moreover, given the risk that could be the case, these provisions of the IRA may also further heighten the risk that we would not be able to achieve the expected return on our drug products or full value of our patents protecting our products if prices are set after such products have been on the market for nine years.   
The first cycle of negotiations for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program commenced in the summer of 2023. On August 15, 2024, the HHS published the results of the first Medicare drug price negotiations for ten selected drugs that treat a range of conditions, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The prices of these ten drugs will become effective January 1, 2026.  On January 17, 2025, CMS announced its selection of 15 additional drugs covered by Part D for the second cycle of negotiations by February 1, 2025.  While there had been some questions about the Trump Administration’s position on this program, CMS issued a public statement on January 29, 2025, declaring that lowering the cost of prescription drugs is a top priority of the new administration and CMS is 
94

Table of Contents
committed to considering opportunities to bring greater transparency in the negotiation program.  The second cycle of negotiations with participating drug companies will occur during 2025, and any negotiated prices for this second set of drugs will be effective starting January 1, 2027.
Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.  In addition, the IRA potentially raises legal risks with respect to individuals participating in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan who may experience a gap in coverage if they required coverage above their initial annual coverage limit before they reached the higher threshold, or “catastrophic period” of the plan. Individuals requiring services exceeding the initial annual coverage limit and below the catastrophic period, must pay 100% of the cost of their prescriptions until they reach the catastrophic period. Among other things, the IRA contains many provisions aimed at reducing this financial burden on individuals by reducing the co-insurance and co-payment costs, expanding eligibility for lower income subsidy plans, and price caps on annual out-of-pocket expenses, each of which could have potential pricing and reporting implications.
On June 6, 2023, Merck & Co. filed a lawsuit against the HHS and CMS asserting that, among other things, the IRA’s Drug Price Negotiation Program for Medicare constitutes an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Subsequently, a number of other parties, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Bristol Myers Squibb Company, the PhRMA, Astellas, Novo Nordisk, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, AstraZeneca and Boehringer Ingelheim, also filed lawsuits in various courts with similar constitutional claims against the HHS and CMS. There have been various decisions by the courts considering these cases since they were filed. The HHS has generally won the substantive disputes in these cases, and various federal district court judges have expressed skepticism regarding the merits of the legal arguments being pursued by the pharmaceutical industry. Certain of these cases are now on appeal and, on October 30, 2024, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit heard oral argument in three of these cases. We expect that litigation involving these and other provisions of the IRA will continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
Accordingly, while it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, we cannot predict with certainty what impact any federal or state health reforms will have on us, but such changes could impose new or more stringent regulatory requirements on our activities or result in reduced reimbursement for our products, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. This is increasingly true with respect to products approved pursuant to the accelerated approval  pathway. State Medicaid programs and other payers are developing strategies and implementing significant coverage barriers, or refusing to cover these products outright, arguing that accelerated approval drugs have insufficient or limited evidence despite meeting the FDA’s standards for accelerated approval. In addition, regional healthcare organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
In countries outside of the United States, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.  In many countries, including those of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.

Reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions. 
As a condition of reimbursement by various federal and state health insurance programs, pharmaceutical companies are required to calculate and report certain pricing information to federal and state agencies. The regulations governing the calculations, price reporting and payment obligations are complex and subject to interpretation by various government and regulatory authorities, as well as the courts. Reasonable assumptions have been made where there is lack of regulations or clear guidance and such assumptions involve subjective decisions and estimates. Pharmaceutical companies are required to report any revisions to calculations, price reporting and payment obligations previously reported or paid. Such revisions could affect liability to federal and state payers and also adversely impact reported financial results of operations in the period of such restatement. 
Uncertainty exists as new laws, regulations, judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations related to our calculations, price reporting or payments obligations increases the chances of a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If a company becomes subject to investigations, restatements, or other inquiries concerning compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, it could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that future healthcare reform measures could be adopted, which could result in increased pressure on pricing and reimbursement of products and thus have an adverse impact on financial position or business operations. 
Further, state Medicaid programs may be slow to invoice pharmaceutical companies for calculated rebates resulting in a lag between the time a sale is recorded and the time the rebate is paid. This results in a company having to carry a liability on its consolidated balance sheets for the estimate of rebate claims expected for Medicaid patients. If actual claims are higher than current estimates, the company’s financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B Program refunds, if a pharmaceutical firm is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to CMS, it may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Such failure could also be grounds for CMS to terminate the Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which companies participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates a rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under government programs, including Medicaid or Medicare Part B, for covered outpatient drugs. 
Additionally, if a pharmaceutical company overcharges the government in connection with the Federal Supply Schedules program or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, it is required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against a company under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
Our collaborators are also subject to similar requirements outside of the United States and thus the attendant risks and uncertainties. If our collaborators suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues. 
Failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our products or product candidates from being marketed abroad.
In order to market and sell our products and product candidates in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, including certain jurisdictions covered by our AffaMed collaboration, we or our third-party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements.  The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing.  The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval.  The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval.  In addition, in many countries outside 
96

Table of Contents
the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be sold in that country.  We or our collaborators may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all.  Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.  However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other countries.  We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.
Additionally, we could face heightened risks with respect to obtaining marketing authorization in the United Kingdom as a result of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The United Kingdom is no longer part of the European Single Market and EU Customs Union. As of January 1, 2025, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the United Kingdom market (i.e., Great Britain and Northern Ireland). At the same time, a new international recognition procedure (“IRP”) will apply, which intends to facilitate approval of pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom. The IRP is open to applicants that have already received an authorization for the same product from one of the MHRA’s specified Reference Regulators (“RRs”). The RRs notably include EMA and regulators in the EU/European Economic Area (“EEA”) member states for approvals in the European Union centralized procedure and mutual recognition procedure as well as the FDA (for product approvals granted in the United States). However, the concrete functioning of the IRP is currently unclear. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals may force us or our collaborators to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.
In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may change their approval policies and new regulations may be enacted. For instance, the European Union pharmaceutical legislation is currently undergoing a complete review process, in the context of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe initiative, launched by the European Commission in November 2020. The European Commission’s proposal for revision of several legislative instruments related to medicinal products (potentially reducing the duration of regulatory data protection, revising the eligibility for expedited pathways, etc.) was published on April 26, 2023. The proposed revisions remain to be agreed and adopted by the European Parliament and European Council and the proposals may therefore be substantially revised before adoption, which is not anticipated before early 2026. The revisions may however have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry and our business in the long term.
We expect that we will also be subject to additional risks in commercializing any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval outside the United States, including tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; and workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States.
Compliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
The regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply. For example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Union, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA, in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials 
97

Table of Contents
conducted in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. 
In addition, the GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States and, as a result, increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that European Union member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data.  Similar laws and regulations have been approved, or are expected to be approved, in several jurisdictions beyond the European Union.    
There are ongoing concerns about the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the European Union to other countries. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, or Privacy Shield, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. While we were not self-certified under the Privacy Shield, this CJEU decision has lead to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the European Union to the United States generally and increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation as well as our costs of negotiating appropriate privacy and security agreements with our vendors and business partners.
Following the CJEU decision, in October 2022, President Biden signed an executive order to implement the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which would serve as a replacement to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The European Commission initiated the process to adopt an adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) in December 2022, and has now adopted an adequacy decision to permit data transfers from the European Union to the United States going forward. This development permits data transfers at this point under this framework and more broadly has made international data transfers more straightforward, but these provisions are being challenged in court. The recent election in the United States and the new administration may also impact whether the DPF remains an adequate data transfer framework. The continuing uncertainty around this issue may further impact our business operations in the European Union.
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom. voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. As with other issues related to Brexit, there are open questions about how personal data will be protected in the United Kingdom and whether personal information can transfer from the European Union to the U.K. Following the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the United Kingdom and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR. While the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom that “implements” and complements the GDPR has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under the GDPR. The U.K. government has already determined that it considers all European Union 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the United Kingdom to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. In addition, a recent decision from the European Commission appears to deem the United Kingdom as being “essentially adequate” for purposes of data transfer from the European Union to the United Kingdom, although this decision may be re-evaluated in the future. The United Kingdom and the United States also have agreed on a framework for personal data to be transferred between the United Kingdom and the United States, called the U.K.-U.S. Data Bridge. The U.K.-U.S. Data Bridge may be challenged in the future. Continuing uncertainty about these data transfers, including the possibility of future changes, may impact our business operations. 
There are multiple privacy and data security laws that may impact our business activities in the United States. These laws are evolving and may increase both our obligations and our regulatory risks in the future. In the health care industry generally, under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. HIPAA may apply to us in certain circumstances and may also apply to our 
98

Table of Contents
business partners in ways that may impact our relationships with them. Any clinical trials we conduct will be regulated by Subpart A of 45 CFR 46, also known as the Common Rule, which also includes specific privacy-related provisions. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that may be applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. State attorneys general also have authority to enforce state privacy and security laws. Moreover, new laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well.
In addition to potential enforcement by the HHS, we could also be potentially subject to privacy enforcement from the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”). The FTC has been particularly focused on the unpermitted processing of health and genetic data through its recent enforcement actions and is expanding the types of privacy violations that it interprets to be “unfair” under Section 5 of the FTC Act, as well as the types of activities it views to trigger the Health Breach Notification Rule (which the FTC also has the authority to enforce). The agency is also in the process of developing rules related to commercial surveillance and data security. We will need to account for the FTC’s evolving rules and guidance for proper privacy and data security practices in order to mitigate risk for a potential enforcement action, which may be costly. Finally, both the FTC and HHS’s enforcement priorities (as well as those of other federal regulators) may be impacted by the change in administration and new leadership. These shifts in enforcement priorities may also impact our business. 
There are also increased restrictions at the federal level relating to transferring sensitive data outside of the United States to certain foreign countries. For example, in 2024, Congress passed H.B. 815, which included the Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2024. This law creates certain restrictions for entities that disclose sensitive data (including potential health data) to countries such as China. Failure to comply with these rules can lead to a potential FTC enforcement action. Additionally, the Department of Justice recently finalized a rule implementing Executive Order 14117, which creates similar restrictions related to the transfer of sensitive US data to countries such as China. These data transfer restrictions (and others that may pass in the future) may create operational challenges and legal risks for our business.
New laws also are being considered at the state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA—which went into effect on January 1, 2020—is creating similar risks and obligations as those created by GDPR, though the CCPA does currently exempt certain information collected as part of a clinical trial subject to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, known as the Common Rule. The CCPA also has been amended through a recent referendum in California that creates additional obligations beginning in 2023.  In addition to California, at least eighteen other states have  
passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA. These laws are either in effect or will go into effect over the next few years. Like the CCPA, these laws create obligations related to the processing of personal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data, which includes health data in some cases. Some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities. There are also states that are strongly considering or have already passed comprehensive privacy laws during the 2024 legislative sessions that will go into effect in 2025 and beyond, including New Hampshire and New Jersey. Other states will be considering these laws in the future, and Congress has also been debating passing a federal privacy law. There are also states that are specifically regulating health information that may affect our business. For example, Washington state passed a health privacy law in 2023 that regulates the collection and sharing of health information, and the law also has a private right of action, which further increases the relevant compliance risk. Connecticut and Nevada have also passed similar laws regulating consumer health data, and more states are considering, such legislation in 2025. These laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of research subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products. 
A broad range of legislative measures also have been introduced at the federal level. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws (both those currently in effect and future legislation) regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. There also is the threat of consumer class actions related to these laws and the overall protection of personal data. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and our business.

Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing for and complying with these requirements is rigorous and time intensive and requires significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants that process or transfer personal data collected in applicable jurisdictions. These changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information from our clinical trials, could require us to change our business practices and put in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing business, and could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and significant fines and penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our internal information technology systems, or those of our vendors, collaborators, contractors, consultants, or other third parties may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs, compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information, trigger contractual and legal obligations, potentially exposing us to liability, reputational harm or otherwise adversely affecting our business and financial results.

We are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including personal information and information relating to intellectual property, on internal and external information systems and through the information systems of our vendors, collaborators, contractors, consultants, or other third parties. It is critical that we, our vendors, collaborators, contractors, consultants, or other third parties, do so in a secure manner to maintain the availability, security, confidentiality, privacy and integrity of such confidential information. 
Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal information technology systems and those of third parties are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, computer hackers, malicious code, employee error, theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated nation-state supported actors, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such systems are also vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, our collaborators, contractors, consultants, vendors, and other third parties, or from cyberattacks by malicious third parties over the Internet or through other mechanisms. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access to or deletion of files, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyberattacks also could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies. We cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to prevent any future breaches.
While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident, cyberattack or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs, clinical trials and business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary or confidential information or other similar disruptions, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from clinical trials could result in delays or termination of our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, as risks with respect to our information systems continue to evolve, we will incur additional costs to maintain the security of our information systems and comply with evolving laws and regulations pertaining to cybersecurity and related areas. 
To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our or our vendors’, collaborators’ or other contractors’ or consultants’ data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, including litigation exposure, penalties and fines, we could become the subject of regulatory action or investigation, enrollment in our clinical trials could be negatively affected, our competitive position and reputation could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. As a result of such an event, we may be in breach of our contractual obligations.

Furthermore, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our customers or employees, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
The financial exposure from the events referenced above could either not be insured against or not be fully covered through any insurance that we maintain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages as a result of the events referenced above.
Laws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.
If and as we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business.  The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.  
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem.  In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials.  Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.  
If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.  
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting.  The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.  
Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth
Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
We remain highly dependent on the research and development, clinical and business development expertise of our principal members of our management, scientific and clinical team, including Pravin Dugel, M.D., our Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time.

Table of Contents
Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success.  The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.  Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products.  Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.  We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions.  In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy.  Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.  If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.  
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.  These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock.  In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors.  Among other things, these provisions:
●
provide for a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;
●
allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;
●
limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;
●
provide for advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;
●
require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;
●
limit who may call stockholder meetings;
●
authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a “poison pill” that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and
●
require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.  
Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

We have been subject to legal proceedings related to the decline in our stock price, and we could be subject to similar legal proceedings in the future, which could distract our management and could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us.
In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. 
In July 2017, we experienced a decline in our stock price following our announcement that we had received notice of the FDA’s determination that it could not approve our NDA for DEXTENZA in its then present form. In 2017 and 2018, class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our executive officers and shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain of our executive officers and directors, and two of our investors and against the company as a nominal defendant.  While these legal proceedings were ultimately resolved in our and/or the applicable defendants’ favor, they were distracting and were both time-consuming and costly to defend.  We may be the target of similar proceedings in the future.  We also may face securities class-action litigation if we cannot obtain regulatory approvals for or if we otherwise fail to commercialize our products or product candidates successfully.
In connection with any such legal proceedings, we could incur substantial costs and such costs and any related settlements or judgments may not be covered by insurance. We could also suffer an adverse impact on our reputation and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.
The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for holders of our common stock.
Our stock price has been, and in the future may be, volatile.  The stock market in general and the market for smaller biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance.  As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it.  The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:
●
results of clinical trials of our product candidates, including AXPAXLI, and the product candidates of our competitors;
●
our success in commercializing DEXTENZA and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, including AXPAXLI;
●
the success of competitive products or technologies;
●
regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;
●
developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;
●
the recruitment or departure of key scientific or management personnel;
●
the results of our efforts and the efforts of our current and future collaborators to discover, develop, acquire or in-license and out-license additional products, product candidates or technologies for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases or conditions, the costs of commercializing any such products and the costs of development of any such product candidates or technologies and any potential dilution to our shareholders as a result of these efforts;
●
actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;
●
variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
●
the ability to secure third-party reimbursement for our products or product candidates;

●
market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and
●
the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.  
Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders’ sole source of gain.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock.  We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business.  In addition, the terms of our Barings Credit Agreement and any future debt agreements that we may enter into, may preclude us from paying dividends without the lenders’ consent or at all.  As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders’ sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.

Cybersecurity
We have certain 
processes
 for identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, which are built into our overall risk management program and are designed to help protect our people, technology, products, information and operations from internal and external cyber threats and to protect the information of employees, customers, vendors, and other individuals, such as subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, from unauthorized access or attack, as well as secure our networks and systems.
 Our cybersecurity program is built upon, and we periodically assess our processes against, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, Cybersecurity Framework Special Publication 800-53, and our incident response capabilities align with NIST 800-61, revision 2, or collectively, the NIST Framework. This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements of the NIST Framework, but rather only that we use these standards as a guide to help us mature our security posture in order to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. 
Our processes for identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity risks include physical, procedural and technical safeguards, a cybersecurity incident response plan, regular tests on our systems, incident simulations and routine review of our policies and procedures to identify risks and improve our practices.

We engage certain external parties, including information technology security firms, to assist us with the identification, verification, and validation of cybersecurity risks, and to support mitigation efforts if necessary.

We consider the internal risk oversight programs of 
third-party
 service providers before engaging them in order to help protect us from any related vulnerabilities.
We do not believe that there are currently any known risks 
from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect us or our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.
The 
Audit Committee
 of our board of directors provides direct oversight over cybersecurity risk and provides updates to the board of directors regarding such oversight as deemed necessary. 
The Audit Committee receives periodic updates from management regarding cybersecurity matters and is notified between such updates regarding significant new cybersecurity threats or incidents. 
Our management team is responsible for day-to-day assessment and management of cybersecurity risks. 
On our management team, our 
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
, or CFO and COO
, leads the operational oversight of company-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards and processes and works across relevant departments to assess and help prepare us and our employees, customers, vendors and other individuals to address cybersecurity risks. 
Our CFO and COO has more than ten years of experience managing information technology teams of operating companies in the biotechnology industry. Our CFO and COO leads a cross-functional Cybersecurity Committee, consisting of executive-level leaders and other management-level individuals with the requisite skills and education, including our Executive Director IT and Cybersecurity, that assists the CFO and COO with carrying out these duties. The Executive Director IT and Cybersecurity has over ten years of offensive and defensive cybersecurity experience with departments of the U.S. government, international alliances and small to large biopharmaceutical companies. Collectively, the members of our Cybersecurity Committee have notable experience in managing information security, possess the education and skills to fulfill these duties, and attend periodic trainings as necessary.

In an effort to deter and detect cyber threats, we provide all employees, including part-time and temporary employees, with periodic training, including training related to data protection, cybersecurity and incident response, and prevention and compliance, which covers timely and relevant topics, including social engineering, phishing, password protection, confidential data protection, asset use and mobile security, and educates employees on the importance of reporting all incidents immediately. We also use technology-based tools to mitigate cybersecurity risks and to bolster our employee-based cybersecurity programs.
