ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
Risk Factors Summary
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
•
We have a history of losses that casts substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We must deliver on our potential for significant business growth and improved manufacturing processes to achieve sustained, long-term profitability and long-term commercial success.
•
The relatively recent commercialization of our products makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects.
•     Failure to deliver the benefits offered by our technologies, or the emergence of improvements to competing technologies, could reduce demand for our products and harm our business.
•
A decline in lithium prices may result in increased competition from traditional lithium-ion batteries and adversely affect the demand for our products.
•
As we endeavor to expand our business, we will incur significant costs and expenses, which could outpace our cash reserves. Unfavorable conditions or disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact business conditions and the availability of credit.
•
Our success depends on the continuing contributions of our key personnel, and the loss of services of any principal member of our management team could adversely affect our business.
•
The failure or breach of our network or IT systems, including as a result of a cybersecurity breach, could affect our sales and operations.
•
Internal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
•
The nature of our business exposes us to potential legal proceedings or claims that could adversely affect our operating results. These claims could conceivably exceed the level of our liability insurance coverage.
•
Labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers and/or lead to higher labor costs.
•
The imposition of tariffs, sanctions, restrictions on imports or other trade barriers between the United States and various countries may impact our revenue and results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Products and Manufacturing
•
We must obtain Underwriters Laboratories and other related certifications for our future generations of our products.
•
Compared to traditional Li-ion energy storage technologies, our cells and modules have less power density and round trip efficiency and may be considered inferior to competitors’ products.
•
We have limited manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty producing commercial volumes of the battery storage system, establishing manufacturing capacity to scale and in meeting potential cost savings and efficiencies from anticipated improvements to our manufacturing capabilities.
•
We may experience delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations.
•
We may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover business continuity.
•
Defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers, reputational damage, and decreased revenue, facing warranty, indemnity, and product liability claims that may arise from defective products.
•
We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and contractors. Supply chain issues could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
•
If we elect to expand our production capacity by constructing additional manufacturing facilities, we may encounter challenges relating to the construction, management and operation of such facilities.
•
We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws.
•
Increased scrutiny from stakeholders and regulators regarding ESG practices and disclosures, including those related to sustainability and related disclosures could result in additional costs and risks.
Risks Related to Our Future Growth
•
If we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of customer service, or adequately address competitive challenges.
11
•
Our growth prospects depend on our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.
•
If we fail to meet the covenants in either the DOE Loan Facility or the Credit Agreement, we may be subject to default under the credit facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
•
The Company may need to seek alternative sources of capital, or risk its ability to continue operations, in the event it fails to meet a funding condition under the terms of the DOE Loan Facility or in the event that the government enacts laws and governmental regulations that could affect the availability of funding under the DOE Loan Facility.
•
A substantial number of shares of the Company’s common stock that are issuable upon the exercise or conversion of securities issued or issuable under the Credit Agreement and the SPA are subject to a contractual lockup.
•
Our planned expansion into new geographic markets or new product lines or services could subject us to additional business, financial, and competitive risks.
•
Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.
Risks Related to Our United States Operations
•
Some of our customers receive federal, state and local government incentives for renewable energy solutions. The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives related to renewable energy solutions could reduce demand for our technologies and harm our business.
•
We have operations in the United States, which exposes us to multiple federal, state and local regulations. 
•
Changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.
•
We are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which could increase the cost of doing business, compliance risks and potential liability.
•
We could be adversely affected by any violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws, as well as violations against export controls and economic embargo regulations.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
•
If we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.
•
Third parties may assert that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, which could divert management’s attention, cause us to incur significant costs, and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate.
Risk Related to Our Securities
•
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the SPA and the securities issued thereunder, current stockholders may be subject to significant dilution, and the voting power of the currently outstanding common stock could be significantly diluted.
•
We currently have a significant number of outstanding securities outstanding that are exercisable for or convertible into our common stock, which could result in significant additional dilution and downward pressure on our stock price. Future issuances of our common stock, including common stock that may be issuable pursuant to outstanding warrants or other convertible securities, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.
•
Provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company (the “Charter”) and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.
•
Provisions in our Charter may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
•
Our stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.
•
Future resales of our common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.
•
We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
•
We are a “smaller reporting company” and, because we have opted to use the reduced reporting requirements available to us, certain investors may find investing in our securities less attractive.
12
Risk Factors
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not known to us or that we consider immaterial as of the date of this Form 10-K. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
We have a history of losses that casts substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We must deliver on our potential for significant business growth and improved manufacturing processes to achieve sustained, long-term profitability and long-term commercial success.
We have had net losses and negative operating cash flows each fiscal quarter since inception of our business. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $685.9 million and $229.5 million in net losses, respectively. We expect to continue to incur losses and experience negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate continued investment in the development and launch of product with outside capital at the expense of short-term profitability. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Company concluded that there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue to operate as a going concern for the 12 months following the issuance of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Although our available capital has increased substantially since our Merger through the issuance of convertible notes and other financing, we continue to have limited resources relative to certain of our competitors, especially certain Li-ion manufacturers that have a longer history, are part of large multinational corporations and are already operating at a profit. To achieve profitability as well as long-term commercial success, we must continue to execute our plan to expand our business, which will require us to deliver on our existing global sales pipeline in a timely manner, increase our production capacity, improve our cost profile, grow demand for our products, and seize new market opportunities by leveraging our proprietary technology and its manufacturing processes for novel solutions. Failure to do one or more of these things could prevent us from achieving sustained, long-term commercial success.
As a growth company in the early commercialization stage of its lifecycle, Eos is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of an enterprise. Our revenues may not grow as expected for a number of reasons, many of which are outside of our control, including a decline in global demand for battery storage products, increased competition, or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. In addition, although we have achieved sales of our products to potential customers, it is not clear to what extent, if any, the products will be profitable and when. The costs of goods associated with production of our battery storage system are significant. While we are working to optimize our supply chain, improve the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing processes, and lower the cost of other input costs such as raw material and conversion costs, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. If we are not able to sustain revenue growth, reduce cost and continue to raise the capital necessary to support operations, our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock. Even if we do achieve profitability when expected, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future.
In order to execute our development strategy, we have historically relied on outside capital through the issuance of equity, debt, and borrowings under financing arrangements (collectively “outside capital”) to fund our cost structure and expect to continue to rely on outside capital for the foreseeable future. While we believe we will eventually reach a scale of profitability to sustain our operations, there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve such profitability or do so in a manner that does not require our continued reliance on outside capital. Moreover, while we have historically been successful in raising outside capital, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to obtain outside capital in the future or do so on terms that are acceptable to us.
13
The relatively recent commercialization of our products makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.
Since our inception, we have sold a limited quantity of Eos Znyth
™
 DC battery systems to our customers. We began commercializing our products in mid-2018, and while our research and development activities successfully established the efficiency of our chemistry, we struggled to incorporate our proven technologies into an effective manufacturing design prior to 2018. 
We continue to invest in the design and development of the next generation product, the Z3™ battery which builds off the same electrochemistry that has not fundamentally changed for the better part of a decade. The Z3 battery is designed to reduce cost and weight and improve manufacturability and system performance. The Eos Z3 transition is fully underway, and the first semi-automated battery manufacturing line is installed and has started commercial production. The Company started delivery of its Z3 battery modules in the third quarter of 2023.
Our success will depend on our ability to manufacture products at scale and low cost while timely meeting customers’ demands and overcome any negative perception in the market related to our historical manufacturing challenges, and we may not be able to generate sufficient customer confidence in our latest designs and ongoing product improvements and lower the cost due to economies of scale. Our inability to predict the extent of customer adoption of our proprietary technologies in the already-established traditional energy storage market makes it difficult to evaluate our profitability and future prospects.
Failure to deliver the benefits offered by our technologies, or the emergence of improvements to competing technologies, could reduce demand for our products and harm our business.
We believe that, compared to Li-ion batteries, our energy storage solutions offer significant benefits, including the use of widely-available and low-cost materials with no rare earth or toxic components, recyclability at end-of-life, an over twenty (20) year product life requiring minimal maintenance, and a wide thermal operating range that eliminates the need for fire suppression and HVAC, which would otherwise be required for use with Li-ion batteries. 
The rates at which electricity is available from a customer’s local electric utility company is subject to change and any changes in such rates may affect the relative benefits of our energy storage systems. Further, if our manufacturing costs do not decrease to the extent we intend, or if our expectations regarding the operation, performance, maintenance and disposal of our products are not realized, we could have difficulty marketing our products as a superior alternative to already-established technologies and impact the market reputation and adaptability of our products. Developments of existing and new technologies could improve their cost and usability profile, reducing any relative benefits currently offered by our products which would negatively impact the likelihood of our products gaining market acceptance.
A decline in lithium prices may result in increased competition from traditional lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) batteries and adversely affect the demand for our products.
Currently, global lithium available supply exceeds demand. Decreases in the price of

lithium, a key component of traditional Li-ion batteries, may increase the competitiveness of the traditional Li-ion batteries relative to the zinc-based energy storage solutions we provide. Mineral prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as global and regional supply and demand, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and foreign currencies, and the political and economic conditions of mineral-producing countries throughout the world. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in a decrease in lithium prices, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
As we endeavor to expand our business, we will incur significant costs and expenses, which could outpace our cash reserves. Unfavorable conditions or disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact business conditions and the availability of credit.
14
We expect to incur additional costs and expenses in the future related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including in connection with expanding our manufacturing capabilities to significantly increase production capacity, developing our products, maintaining and enhancing our research and development operations, expanding our sales, marketing, and business development activities in the United States and internationally, and growing our project management, field services and overall operational capabilities for delivering projects. We do not know whether we will be able to reduce our manufacturing cost and grow our revenue rapidly enough to absorb these costs or the extent of these expenses or their impact on our results of operations.
Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets as a result of an economic downturn, economic uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our customers’ ability to access capital and could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for business in the future. Our business could be hurt if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, resulting in a decrease in our revenues and profitability.
Our success depends on the continuing contributions of our key personnel, and the loss of services of any principal member of our management team could adversely affect our business.
We rely heavily on the services of our key executive officers. We are investing significant resources in developing new members of management as we complete our restructuring and strategic transformation, and the loss of services of any principal member of our management team could adversely affect our business. The competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining enough qualified personnel to support our anticipated growth. We also cannot guarantee that any employee will remain employed with us for any definite period since all of our employees, including our key executive officers, serve at-will and may terminate their employment at any time for any reason.
The Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is committed to working with the management to design compensation plans that attract, retain and motivate the Company’s executives and support business objectives that create shareholder value. In addition, the Board of Directors has implemented procedures to plan for the effective succession of senior management and key personnel. However, we still depend on the experience of our senior management team, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, and other key personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace in the event of an unforeseen departure from the Company. Despite successfully managing recent turnover, the loss of any such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to implement our business strategy. All of our employees, including our senior management, are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time. We do not maintain key-person insurance for any of our employees, including senior management. In addition, changes and replacement, as well as transition in senior executive leadership could adversely affect our relationships with clients, customers, and employees. We must successfully integrate new key personnel whom we hire within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives.
Additionally, our ability to attract qualified personnel, including senior management and key technical personnel, is critical to the execution of our growth strategy. Competition for qualified senior management personnel and highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense. We face and are likely to continue to face challenges identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel in all areas of our business. In addition, integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations, require substantial resources and management attention, and ultimately prove unsuccessful. Our failure to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key technical personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
The failure or breach of our network or IT systems, including as a result of a cybersecurity breach, could affect our sales and operations.
From time to time, we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our network or IT systems through various forms of the Internet or try to introduce malicious software to our network or IT systems, including our BMS. We or our products may be a target of computer hackers, organizations or malicious attackers who attempt to:
•
gain access to our systems, network or data centers or those of our customers;
15
•
steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or
•
interrupt our infrastructure or those of our customers.
To date, no attempts have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations; however, there can be no guarantee that such intrusions will not be material in the future. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network and products, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes to our products, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats, such as, among other things, malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware attacks, social engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or denial-of-service attacks. In addition to intentional third-party cybersecurity breaches, the integrity and confidentiality of Company and customer data may be compromised as a result of human error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, product defects, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure or other technological failures. Such threats are evolving, may be difficult for long periods of time, and may see their frequency increased and effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence. Further, these risks may be heightened in connection with ongoing global conflicts such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict between Israel and Hamas. Cybersecurity breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, and other IT system interruptions, including those resulting from human error and technological failures, could result in us incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties.
Our IT infrastructure is currently managed by a third party Managed Services Provider ("MSP"). While we regularly review the cybersecurity tools and other security protection provided by this MSP, and this MSP regularly runs intrusion and other security tests on services provided to us, there can be no guarantee that a failure or breach of such systems will not occur. While we generally perform cybersecurity diligence on our other key service providers, we do not control our service providers and our ability to monitor their cybersecurity is limited. Some of our service providers may store or have access to our data and may not have effective controls, processes, or practices to protect our information from loss, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized use or misappropriation or cybersecurity breaches. A vulnerability in our service providers’ software or systems, a failure of our service providers’ safeguards, policies or procedures, or a cybersecurity breach affecting any of these third parties could harm our business.
We operate a few IT systems throughout our business that could fail for a variety of reasons, including the threats of unauthorized intrusions and attackers. If such failures were to occur, we may not be able to sufficiently recover to avoid the loss of data or any adverse impact on our operations that are dependent on such IT systems. This could result in lost sales as we may not be able to meet the demands for our product.
Furthermore, because our IT systems are essential for the exchange of information both internally and in communicating with third parties, including our suppliers and manufacturers, cybersecurity breaches could potentially lead to the unauthorized release of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, or, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information or defective products. If these cybersecurity breaches continue, our operations and ability to communicate both internally and with third parties may be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we try to remediate our cybersecurity problems, we could face significant unplanned costs or capital investments and any damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. 
Internal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
16
Any system or service disruptions, including to our IT systems managed by a MSP, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could materially and adversely affect our business. We, and the service providers on which we rely, are also subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats, malicious insiders, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other events, which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications, or those of our service providers, could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses resulting from any system or operational failure or disruption.
The nature of our business exposes us to potential legal proceedings or claims that could adversely affect our operating results. These claims could conceivably exceed the level of our liability insurance coverage.
We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Responding to lawsuits brought against us, or legal actions that we may initiate, can be expensive and time-consuming. Unfavorable outcomes from these claims and/or lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition and cash flows, and we could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change our business practices. See Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”
Our business may expose us to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of our products or from employee related matters. Additionally, we could be subject to potential litigation associated with compliance with various laws and governmental regulations at the federal, state or local levels, such as those relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, employment, health, safety, security and other regulations under which we operate. 
We carry comprehensive insurance, subject to deductibles, at levels we believe are sufficient to cover existing and future claims made during the respective policy periods. However, we may be exposed to multiple claims, and, as a result, could incur significant out-of-pocket costs before reaching the deductible amount, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of such insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance we carry as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Although we have not experienced any material losses that were not covered by insurance, our existing or future claims may exceed the coverage level of our insurance, and such insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates or must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by our insurance, then we could experience higher costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers and/or lead to higher labor costs. 
As of December 31, 2024, we have 430 full-time employees. 
Approximately 160 production and maintenance employees at our facilities in Turtle Creek and East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO/CLC (“USW”). 
We entered our first collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with USW applicable to the USW-represented employees on February 14, 2025, and the agreement was ratified and became effective on February 19, 2025 and expires on April 30, 2028. The CBA retains a probationary period and existing entry-level wage rates for new employees, provides seniority-based wage progression for entry-level positions and includes general wage increases for other positions. No wage increases become effective until May 1, 2026. The CBA allows for employee participation in existing and future Company benefits, including 401(k) and health and welfare benefits, as offered to our other non-represented employees. The wage and benefit costs agreed in the CBA do not materially increase our previously planned budgetary expenditures at our facilities. 
17
The CBA also allows for substantial operational flexibility with broad management rights, subcontracting rights, flexible shift and overtime scheduling, and work rules to preserve reliability and performance of the production facilities. Finally, the CBA contains other common agreement provisions, including non-discrimination, no-strike/no-lockout, union security, safety, discipline, and grievance and arbitration procedures.
We maintain a positive and collaborative relationship with the USW, which led to relatively quick agreement on CBA terms. Management considers union relations to be good and the USW as a valuable partner for workforce training and management.
The imposition of tariffs, sanctions, restrictions on imports or other trade barriers between the United States and various countries may impact our revenue and results of operations.
The current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements. The new, substantial tariff increases on imports to the United States from Canada, Mexico and China announced on February 1, 2025, or other tariffs should they be implemented and sustained for an extended period of time, could have a significant adverse effect, including financial, on the overall energy storage solutions industry, us, and our supply chain. Further, retaliatory tariffs imposed by other governments would exacerbate the impact. 
The Company sources approximately 15% of parts, products or materials from Canada and Mexico. As long as such tariffs are in effect, we expect that the costs of such parts, products and materials would increase. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include additional or increased tariffs and trade restrictions, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions, which could result in supply shortages and increased costs.
We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be changed or imposed. If we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, imposition of tariffs may result in local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries, which would negatively impact our business and operating results.
Risks Related to Our Products and Manufacturing
We must obtain Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") and other related certifications for our future generations of product.
Our existing generation of battery systems has received Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") 1973 certification and has been tested for UL 9540A. Based on these North American certifications, we also intend to expand our current generation of battery systems product certification to other national standards such as European Conformity (“CE”) marking in the European Union and the international certification of the International Electrotechnical Commission (“IEC”). We also intend to obtain the UL certification and all applicable safety standards for our future products. Failure to obtain UL, IEC or CE certification would have a significant impact on our revenues, as such certifications are required by most of our customers. As Battery Storage is a relatively new market segment, additional rules will be introduced and regulation changes will occur. We must continue to adapt and ensure conformity to new standards and regulations introduced in the market.
Compared to traditional Li-ion energy storage technologies, our cells and modules have less power density and round trip efficiency and may be considered inferior to competitors’ products.
18
While the energy density of the Eos Z3™ battery enclosure product is significantly improved compared to the Eos Gen 2.3 enclosure product, and we believe that for certain installation sites the Eos Z3 systems may now equal Li-ion energy density per acre of land, traditional Li-ion cells and modules continue to offer higher power density and a lower self-discharge rate than Eos cells and modules. The differences in power density and energy efficiency become lower when comparing full size Li-ion systems to Eos Z3 systems due to the differences in auxiliary loads required by Li-ion systems and safety spacing between enclosures required by Li-ion, however, if customers were to place greater value on power density and efficient power delivery on a cell and module basis, then we could have difficulty positioning our batteries as a viable or compelling alternative to traditional Li-ion batteries and our business would suffer.
We have limited manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing commercial volumes of the battery storage system, establishing manufacturing capacity to scale and in meeting potential cost savings and efficiencies from anticipated improvements to our manufacturing capabilities.
We have limited experience in commercial manufacturing of the battery storage system. On August 21, 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Holtec and formed Hi-Power, which was owned 51% by Holtec and 49% by us. We acquired the 51% equity interest owned by Holtec in April 2021. Because we have limited prior commercial manufacturing experience, we may incur manufacturing inefficiencies, delays or interruptions. Our current manufacturing and testing processes do not require significant technological or production process expertise. However, any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors, requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched, identified, and properly addressed and rectified. This may occur particularly as we introduce new products, modify our engineering and production techniques, and/or expand our capacity. In addition, our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures, loss of customers, increased warranty reserve, decreased production, and logistical costs and delays. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
To date, we have only manufactured batteries in limited quantities for commercial customers. The output achieved to date is a fraction of what the Company expects will be necessary for full commercialization and to meet the demand we see in the market for our product. The manufacturing process for commercial scale is being refined and improved. There are risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial volumes including, among others, technical or other problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, quality consistency, timely availability of raw materials and cost overruns. There is no assurance that we will be successful in establishing a larger-scale commercial manufacturing process that achieves our objectives for manufacturing capacity and cost per battery, in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to produce sufficient quantities of product for commercialization on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, the Company's commercialization efforts would be impaired which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
We may experience delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations.
Our operations require significant amounts of certain components and raw materials. We deploy a continuous, company wide process to source the components and raw materials from a few suppliers. If we are unable to source these components or raw materials, our operations may be disrupted, or we could experience a delay or halt in certain of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, reduced availability or interruption in supplies, whether resulting from more stringent regulatory requirements, supplier financial condition, increases in duties and tariff costs, disruptions in transportation, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, severe weather, the occurrence or threat of wars, and other geopolitical conflict could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Some of our customers may experience project delays as a result of delays in site selection and preparation, procedures of obtaining necessary permissions and establishing grid connections. These delays have impacted, and may, from time to time, continue to impact the timing of our product deliveries and our results of operations.
We may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover business continuity.
19
We rely on a single manufacturing site in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania to manufacture the products to our customers. As a result, a sustained or repeated interruption in the manufacturing of our products due to labor shortage, fire, flood, war, pandemic, or natural disasters may interfere with our ability to manufacture our products and fulfill customers’ demands in a timely manner. Failure to manufacture our products and meet customer demands would impair our ability to generate revenues which would adversely affect our financial results.
Defects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers, reputational damage, and decreased revenue, facing warranty, indemnity, and product liability claims that may arise from defective products.
Since our inception, our business objectives have been focused on producing a safe, low-cost grid-scale energy storage solution to meet the increasing demand for and adoption of renewable energy generation assets. Our Z3 battery design has, after years of research and prototype development, resulted in robust control of cell-to-cell spacing using a method which can easily be scaled for mass manufacturing production.
Although our products meet our stringent quality requirements, they may contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new generations of products are released. Errors, defects, or poor performance can arise due to design flaws, defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties, which can affect the quality of our products. In addition, our BMS software may contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities (including to cyber attacks), design defects or technical limitations. Some errors, bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect. Any actual or perceived errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, defects, or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products, shipment delays, rejection of our products, damage to our reputation, legal claims, lost revenue, diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and increases in customer service and support costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  
Furthermore, defective components may give rise to warranty, indemnity, or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products. Generally, our product comes with an initial two (2) year manufacturing warranty. We also offer customers an extended performance warranty of up to twenty (20) years at an additional cost to the customer. The price charged for any such extended warranty is based on the use case of the customer and the additional performance that such customer desires. For extended warranties, this may require system augmentation or battery replacements, which would be provided at no additional charge beyond the price of the extended warranty paid by such customer.
While we accrued reserves for warranty claims, our estimated warranty costs for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty. Our warranty accruals are based on various assumptions, which are based on a short operating history. As a result, these assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our systems, causing us to incur substantial unanticipated expense to repair or replace defective products in the future or to compensate customers for defective products. Our failure to accurately predict future claims could result in unexpected volatility in, and have a material adverse effect on, our financial condition.
If one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage, due to a result of product malfunctions, defects, or improper installation, we could be exposed to product liability claims. We could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us. Further, any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention. The successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, penalties or fines, subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position, and adversely affect sales of our products. In addition, product liability claims, injuries, defects, or other problems experienced by other companies in the battery industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers, thus harming our growth and financial performance.
We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and contractors. Supply chain issues could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
20
We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and contractors and their ability to deliver sufficient quantities of key components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet schedules for the delivery of our products and services. In addition, our operations depend on our ability to anticipate and our suppliers’ ability to fulfill, our needs for sufficient quantities of key components and products. Given the diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver our products, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management, and regulatory compliance that could seriously harm our business. Suppliers may face global supply chain challenges, such as transportation delays or reduced access to raw materials, and our business could be negatively impacted if suppliers are forced to reduce their normal operations.
If we elect to expand our production capacity by constructing one or more new manufacturing facilities, we may encounter challenges relating to the construction, management and operation of such facilities.
We currently operate our manufacturing facility located in Pennsylvania. We may, however, seek to construct one or more manufacturing facilities designed to meet our product supply needs in the future. Although we currently believe that we can expand our Turtle Creek facility to a 2 gigawatt-hour (“GWh”) manufacturing facility, we cannot provide any assurances that we would be able to successfully establish or operate a new manufacturing facility in a timely or profitable manner, or at all, or within any budget that might be forecasted for such a project. In addition, in order to access Tranche 3 and Tranche 4 under the DOE Loan Agreement, the Company would be required to open a new manufacturing facility satisfactory to the DOE to complete Lines 3 and 4 (as defined in the DOE Loan Agreement). The construction of any such facility would require significant capital expenditures and result in significantly increased fixed costs. If we are unable to transition manufacturing operations to any such new facilities in a cost-efficient and timely manner, then we may experience disruptions in operations, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. Further, if the demand for our products decreases or if we do not produce the expected output after any such new facility is operational, we may not be able to spread a significant amount of our fixed costs over the production volume, thereby increasing our product unit fixed cost, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity would also greatly depend on our ability to hire, train and retain an adequate number of manufacturing employees, in particular employees with the appropriate level of knowledge, background and skills. Should we be unable to hire such employees, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.
We could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws. 
Our properties, operations and the products we manufacture are subject to a number of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination, employee health and safety and the content of products. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to joint and several liability for environmental investigations and remediation, including sites at which waste we generated was disposed, even if the contamination was not caused by us or was lawful at the time it occurred.

Our failure to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including failing to obtain any necessary permits, could cause us to incur substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to conduct or fund remedial or corrective measures, install pollution control equipment or perform other actions. The future identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, enactment of more stringent laws, regulations or permit requirements, including relating to climate change, or other unanticipated events may arise in the future and give rise to environmental liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Increased scrutiny from stakeholders and regulators regarding environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices and disclosures, including those related to climate change and sustainability, as well as recent U.S. based anti-ESG efforts, could result in additional costs and risks.
21
Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures. Our failure to satisfy evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting may potentially harm our reputation and impact employee retention, customer relationships and access to capital and financial markets. We have established goals related to ESG matters. These goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these goals and objectives present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material negative impact, including on our reputation and the market price of our common stock.
Further, certain institutional investors, investor advocacy groups, investment funds, creditors, influential financial markets participants and other stakeholders have become increasingly focused on companies' ESG issues in evaluating their investments and business relationships. Certain organizations also provide ESG ratings, scores and benchmarking studies that assess companies’ ESG practices. Although there are no universally accepted standards for such ratings, scores or benchmarking studies, they are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. It is possible that our future shareholders or organizations that report on, rate or score ESG practices will not be satisfied with our ESG performance. At the same time, some stakeholders and regulators have increasingly expressed or pursued opposing views, legislation, and investment expectations with respect to ESG, including the enactment or proposal of “anti-ESG” legislation or policies. Unfavorable press about or ratings or assessments of our ESG practices, regardless of whether or not we comply with applicable legal requirements, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our share price and our access to and cost of capital. 
In addition, the adoption of new ESG-related regulations, or changes to existing ESG-related regulations, applicable to our business, or pressure from key stakeholders to comply with additional voluntary ESG-related initiatives or frameworks, could require us to make substantial investments in ESG matters, which could impact the results of our operations. Decisions or related investments in this regard could affect consumer perceptions as to our brand. We could also fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of any announced ESG initiatives, goals or objectives, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives, goals or objectives. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders or our initiatives, goals or objectives are not executed as planned, our reputation, financial results and market price of our common stock and access to and cost of capital could be materially and adversely affected.
Risks Related to Our Future Growth
If we fail to manage our recent and future growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of customer service, or adequately address competitive challenges.
We have experienced significant growth in recent periods and intend to continue to expand our business significantly within existing and new markets. This growth has placed, and any future growth may place, a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial infrastructure. We will be required to expand, train, and manage our growing employee base and scale and otherwise improve our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure in tandem with that headcount growth. Our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers, and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers, as well as manage multiple geographic locations.
Our current and planned operations, personnel, customer support, IT, information systems, and other systems and procedures might be inadequate to support future growth and may require us to make additional unanticipated investments in its infrastructure. Our success and ability to further scale our business will depend, in part, on our ability to manage these changes in a cost-effective and efficient manner. If we cannot manage our growth, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies, or respond to competitive pressures. This could also result in declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increased costs, difficulties in introducing new offerings, or other operational difficulties. Any failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business and reputation.
Our growth prospects depend on our ability to capitalize on market opportunities.
22
We believe that several market opportunities could help fuel our growth prospects, including the following:
•
the pervasiveness of electric grid congestion, creating an opportunity to deploy batteries to reduce the peak energy usage of a customer in specific locations where infrastructure constraints create a need for transmission and/or distribution upgrades;
•
the demand for co-location of battery assets on solar or wind farms to store off-peak intermittent renewable energy production and provide on-peak energy at the higher price of alternative energy; 
•
C&I end users’ adoption of alternative energy generation technologies to supplement or replace on-the-grid energy usage; and
•
carbon reduction targets and lower prices from renewables may be forcing earlier retirement of conventional energy sources and drive demand for energy storage.
If these expected market opportunities do not materialize, or if we fail to capitalize on them, then we may not be able to meet our growth projections.
If we fail to meet the covenants in either the DOE Loan Facility or the Credit Agreement, we may be subject to default under the credit facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The DOE Loan Facility and Credit Agreement contain various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company including, among others, as defined in the Credit Agreement (i) meeting certain Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, Minimum Consolidated Revenue, and Minimum Liquidity (the cash in accounts controlled by the collateral agent) measured quarterly, (ii) reporting and information covenants including the delivery of annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements, daily cash reports, annual financial plans and forecasts with weekly progress reports and updates, (iii) monthly meetings with the lenders and the engagement of advisors and consultants requested by the lenders, and (iv) restrictions on business and activities including debt incurrence, asset dispositions, distributions, investments, and modifications to or terminations of various material contracts. The DOE Loan Facility and the Credit Agreement are subject to certain events of default which can be triggered by, among other things, (i) breach of payment obligations and other obligations and representations in the DOE Loan Facility, Credit Agreement or related documents, (ii) default under other debt facilities with a principal above a predetermined amount, (iii) failure to perform or comply with certain covenants in the DOE Loan facility and the Credit Agreement, (iv) entry into a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or under any other debtor relief law, (v) any money judgment, writ or warrant of attachment or similar process involving in the aggregate at any time an amount in excess of $2.5 million, (vi) any order, judgement or decree entered against the Company or the any of its subsidiaries decreeing the dissolution or split up of such entity, (vii) the failure of the common stock to be listed on an internationally recognized stock exchange in the United States and (viii) a change of control.
On November 26, 2024, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement Amendment, pursuant to which among other things, the applicability of the Consolidated Revenue and EBITDA financial covenants were deferred until December 31, 2025 and certain provisions were modified to conform with comparable provisions in the DOE Loan Facility and with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event the Company is unable to comply with all financial covenants when required under the Credit Agreement or the DOE Loan Facility, and the Company is unable to secure another waiver or amendment to the Credit Agreement or the DOE Loan Facility, the lenders may, at their discretion, exercise any and all of their existing rights and remedies, which may include, among other things, asserting their rights in the Company’s assets securing the loan, and the lender under the DOE Loan Facility may no longer be required to continue funding. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure funding under the DOE Loan Facility or outside sources of capital in the event it fails to meet a funding condition or comply with the various covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries under the DOE Loan Facility or the Credit Agreement. Moreover, the Company’s other lenders may exercise similar rights and remedies under the cross-default provisions of their respective borrowing arrangements with the Company. Any such default on the Credit Agreement or the DOE Loan Facility could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The Credit Agreement and the DOE Loan Facility are secured by a substantial portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, resulting in a lack of substantial remaining assets available for incurring additional indebtedness. 
23
The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and it is secured by perfected first priority security interests (subject to customary exceptions and permitted liens) over the assets of the Company and of its subsidiaries. In addition, the DOE Loan Facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and is secured by a lien (subject to customary exceptions and permitted liens) on all real and personal property and all intellectual property collateral of the Company and its subsidiaries, including its Turtle Creek manufacturing site.
Because a substantial portion of the Company’s assets secure the Credit Agreement and the DOE Loan Facility, we do not have substantial remaining assets available to secure other indebtedness. Accordingly, we may not be able to incur additional secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, the terms of each of the Credit Agreement and the DOE Loan Facility significantly limit our ability to incur additional debt, including secured debt. If we are unable in the future to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, to finance our operations and projects, such limitation could have an adverse effect on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company may need to seek alternative sources of capital, or risk its ability to continue operations, in the event it fails to meet a funding condition under the terms of the DOE Loan Facility or in the event that the government enacts laws and governmental regulations that could affect the availability of funding under the DOE Loan Facility.
Pursuant to the terms of the DOE Loan Facility, the lender is not required to provide funding under the DOE Loan Facility in the event that the Company does not meet the necessary funding conditions stipulated in the DOE Loan Facility. In the event the Company does not meet these funding conditions and the lender chooses not to continue funding, the Company would need to seek alternative sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If the lender does not continue funding, and the Company’s efforts to raise additional outside capital prove unsuccessful, management would be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment in the Company’s operations, a sale of certain of the Company’s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent. 
In addition, on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” that, among other provisions, directed DOE to pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and to review DOE’s processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law and the policy outlined in the Executive Order. The Company is currently uncertain whether the required review under the Executive Order will impact the availability to receive funding under the DOE Loan Facility. There can be no assurance as to DOE’s implementation of the Executive Order, the new Administration’s views of the contemplated DOE review or its future policies, or the impact of those policies on the DOE Loan Facility and our existing and future projects, including our related contracts. 
A substantial number of shares of the Company’s common stock that are issuable upon the exercise or conversion of securities issued or issuable under the Credit Agreement and the SPA are subject to a contractual lockup.
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement and the SPA, the holders of our securities issued or issuable thereunder are subject to a contractual lockup that expires on June 21, 2025. Such securities represent a substantial portion of our outstanding shares of common stock and, subject to beneficial ownership limitations, have the potential to represent an even larger portion of our outstanding shares of common Stock, and we are obligated to register the resale of these shares of common stock by the holders. 
Upon the effectiveness of the resale registration statement or otherwise in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act and after expiration or waiver of the lock-up, the holders may sell our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the trading price of our common stock or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock. 
24
The resale, or expected or potential resale, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at times and prices that you feel are appropriate. Furthermore, because there will be a large number of shares registered pursuant to the registration statement, selling holders could continue to offer the securities covered by the registration statement for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to a registration statement may continue for an extended period of time.
Further, sales of our common stock upon expected expiration of resale restrictions could encourage short sales by market participants. Generally, short selling means selling a security, contract or commodity not owned by the seller. The seller is committed to eventually purchase the financial instrument previously sold. Short sales are used to capitalize on an expected decline in the security’s price. As such, short sales of our common stock could have a tendency to depress the price of our common stock, which could further increase the potential for short sales.
We cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including issuances made in the ordinary course of the Company’s business, or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
Our planned expansion into new geographic markets or new product lines or services could subject us to additional business, financial, and competitive risks.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we primarily sold our products in the United States. We have in the past, and may in the future, evaluate opportunities to expand into new geographic markets and introduce new product offerings and services that are a natural extension of our existing business. We also may from time to time engage in acquisitions of businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our market position, enable us to enter attractive markets, expand our technological capabilities, or provide synergy opportunities.
Our success operating in these new geographic or product markets, or in operating any acquired business, will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to develop solutions to address the requirements of the electric utility industry and C&I end users, our timely qualification and certification of new products, our ability to manage increased manufacturing capacity and production, and our ability to identify and integrate any acquired businesses.
Further, any additional markets that we may enter could have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products, and our success will depend on our ability to adapt properly to these differences. These differences may include regulatory requirements, including tax laws, trade laws, labor regulations, tariffs, export quotas, customs duties, or other trade restrictions, limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection, international, political or economic conditions, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings, longer sales cycles, warranty expectations, product return policies and cost, performance and compatibility requirements. In addition, expanding into new geographic markets will increase our exposure to presently existing and new risks, such as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and difficulties and increased expenses in complying with United States and foreign laws, regulations, and trade standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”).
Failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully into the market, to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to otherwise manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets, could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability.
Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which could make our future performance difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations for a particular period to fall below expectations, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.
25
Revenue from our battery sales is primarily recorded upon transfer of ownership of the product to the customer. Under our customer contracts, this transfer typically takes place upon shipment of the battery from our manufacturing facility but, in some instances, occurs upon delivery to a customer site or, even more infrequently, when commercial operation commences. Because our revenues are generally derived from sales of hardware that may take many months to manufacture and prepare for delivery, such revenue can come in peaks and troughs based on the underlying customer arrangements. As a result, our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future based on the timing of product deliveries.
Risks Related to Our United States Operations
Some of our customers receive federal, state and local government incentives for renewable energy solutions. The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives related to renewable energy solutions could reduce demand for our technologies and harm our business.
To promote renewable energy generation and consumption, federal, state, local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of alternative energy systems in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, issuance of renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of certain renewable energy systems from property tax assessments. Some of our customers receive these incentives for investment in energy storage projects.
Our business relies, in part, on the co-location of battery assets with solar and wind technologies. The market for on-grid applications, where solar or wind power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, often depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market. The reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid renewable electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of alternative electricity generation relative to conventional and nonrenewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the alternative electricity industries. Because our C&I end user sales are generally expected to be made into the on-grid market, these changes could harm our business. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022 allows owners of new batteries to claim an ITC of between 30% and 70% during 2023 through a period that extends at least into the 2030s and possibly longer. The tax credit amount depends on the location of the battery and amount of domestic content. Companies should have an incentive to buy US-made batteries to qualify for a higher tax credit. A condition to claim tax credits at these levels is the same as wages that are paid on federal construction projects must be paid to mechanics and laborers who work at the project site and lay down yard during construction and for the five years after on alterations and repairs, and qualified apprentices must be used during the same periods for as much as 15% of total labor hours.  
The Inflation Reduction Act also allows manufacturers of certain battery components made in the United States to claim tax credits. Under Internal Revenue Code Section 6417(d), certain eligible taxpayers, including such manufacturers, can elect direct payment, enabling the Internal Revenue Service to treat the tax credit amount as a deemed tax payment and refund any excess as a cash tax payment, even if the taxpayer has no tax liability. This election can be made for any taxable year in which the taxpayer qualifies for the credit, and, once made, applies to that taxable year and the subsequent four taxable years, resulting in five consecutive years of direct payment. The tax credits for manufacturers start phasing down in amount after 2029 and end after 2032.  
Both sets of tax credits are expected to increase demand for batteries and encourage more US domestic manufacturing of batteries. If in the future, Congress were to repeal or cut back the incentives, it could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In general, subsidies and incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase or as a result of legal challenges, the adoption of new statutes or regulations or the passage of time. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.
26
In addition, several jurisdictions have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered by utilities to customers each year must come from renewable energy resources. Utilities must either generate the renewable electricity themselves or buy renewable energy credits ("REC"s) from independent generators who have been awarded them for generating renewable electricity. Utilities may buy such RECs bundled with renewable electricity. An REC allows the utility to add this electricity to its renewable portfolio requirement total without actually expending the capital for generating facilities. However, there can be no assurances that such policies will continue. 
If subsidies and incentives applicable to alternative energy implementation or usage are reduced or eliminated, or the regulatory landscape otherwise becomes less favorable, then there could be reduced demand for alternative energy solutions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The new presidential administration and Congress may seek to repeal or curtail the tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as its other tax provisions intended to incentivize renewable energy technologies. Changes in laws related to the tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, or changes in interpretations of such laws, communications with regulatory agencies, transactions or agreements with third parties, and/or evolving interpretations of the Final Regulations may result in a material change in our estimate of tax credits to which we may be entitled, which could materially affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Finally, the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, which restricted federal agencies’ ability to interpret vague or broad legislation, could introduce uncertainty around applicable agency regulations and, therefore, negatively impact the demand for our services. See Part I, Item I - Business - Regulations for further discussion of government programs and incentives.
We have operations in the United States, which exposes us to multiple federal, state and local regulations. Changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.
Applicable laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as worker safety, consumer rights, data privacy, cybersecurity, employee benefits and more, and can often have different requirements in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure to comply with them, could increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, drain management’s time and attention or otherwise, generally impact our operations in adverse ways.
We are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which could increase the cost of doing business, compliance risks and potential liability.
We are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations governing data privacy and cybersecurity and any failure to comply with these laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Compliance with these laws, regulations, rules and standards may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for data privacy and cybersecurity, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws, regulations, rules and standards.
27
In the U.S., there are numerous federal, state and local data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security, storage, transfer and other processing of personal information. At the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission (which has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and cybersecurity). Moreover, the U.S. Congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity legislation, to which we may be subject if passed. At the U.S. state level, we may be subject to laws and regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “CCPA”), which broadly defines personal information and gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. Numerous other states also have enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering, comprehensive state-level data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations that share similarities with the CCPA. Moreover, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach.
Further, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, regulations, rules and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and cybersecurity. Although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and cybersecurity can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Any concerns about our data privacy and cybersecurity practices, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, rules, standards or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). Any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We could be adversely affected by any violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws, as well as violations against export controls and economic embargo regulations. 
28
The FCPA prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Other countries in which we operate also have anti-bribery laws, some of which prohibit improper payments to government and non-government persons and entities. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. However, we currently operate in and intend to further expand into, many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In addition, due to the level of regulation in our industry and related energy industries, our entry into certain jurisdictions may require substantial government contact where norms can differ from U.S. standards. Although we expect to maintain strict internal control policies and procedures designed to guard against improper conduct, there can be no guarantee that our employees, agents, and business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal control policies. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable laws, including anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, and detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Any violation of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, and curtailment of operations in the United States or other applicable jurisdictions. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the United States, including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. While we do not conduct business with sanctioned and embargoed countries and we expect to maintain strict internal controls policies and procedures designed to guard against improper conduct, a determination that we have failed to comply, whether knowingly or inadvertently, may result in substantial penalties, including fines and enforcement actions and civil and/or criminal sanctions, the disgorgement of profits and the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, as well as the denial of export privileges, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property
If we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.
Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality and other contractual provisions with our customers, suppliers, employees, and others, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid or not enforceable. Our assertion of intellectual property rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. Our inability to enforce intellectual property rights under any of these circumstances would likely harm our competitive position and business.
We have been issued patents in, or have patent applications pending in the United States, North America, Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology, and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to, among other things, rebrand or redesign our affected products. In countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the United States, we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated.
29
Our intellectual property may be stolen or infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets or business disruption, including inappropriate retention or disclosure of trade secrets by current or former employees. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees and lead to claims against the company. Any lawsuits that we may initiate to protect our significant investment in our intellectual property also may consume management and financial resources for long periods of time and may not result in favorable outcomes, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Third parties may assert that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, which could divert management’s attention, cause us to incur significant costs, and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate.
Our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry. From time to time, we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation and related litigation, and, if we gain greater recognition in the market, we will face a higher risk of being the subject of claims that we have violated others’ intellectual property rights. While we believe that our products and technology do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims. If we do not successfully defend or settle intellectual property claims, we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology, business methods, content, or brands. To avoid a prohibition, we could seek a license from the applicable third party, which could require us to pay significant royalties, increasing our operating expenses. If a license is not available at all or not available on reasonable terms, then we may be required to develop or license a non-violating alternative, either of which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop a non-violating alternative, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our offerings and may be unable to effectively compete. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Securities
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the SPA and the securities issued thereunder, current stockholders may be subject to significant dilution, and the voting power of the currently outstanding common stock could be significantly diluted.
As of February 26, 2025, there were 226,599,297 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and an aggregate of 253,238,633 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion or exercise of outstanding convertible securities (as calculated under the Credit Agreement and the SPA), including 158,433,112 shares of common stock underlying the Warrant (as defined below) and Preferred Stock (as defined below) issued to Cerberus under the Credit Agreement and the SPA (the “Cerberus Securities”).
If the Company fails to meet all of the remaining milestones as of the final milestone measurement date under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, Cerberus would be entitled to receive additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock (as defined below) or Warrants aggregating to a maximum Applicable Percentage of 37.0% (originally 49.0%), or assuming the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis does not change after February 26, 2025, Preferred Stock and Warrants with respect to an aggregate of 177,540,034 shares of Common Stock, including the Cerberus Securities already issued to Cerberus. Such shares of Preferred Stock and Warrants are directly or indirectly convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock, subject only to a beneficial ownership cap of 49.9% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. Furthermore, the Certificates of Designation governing the Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Certificates of Designation”) contain preemptive rights that permit the holders of Series B Preferred Stock to participate in certain future equity offerings by the Company.
30
In addition, if the Company were to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into common stock or trigger anti-dilution protection under the Cerberus Securities, the Cerberus Securities may become convertible or exercisable into additional shares of common stock. The issuance, pursuant to the terms of the Cerberus Securities, of common stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of all stockholders, could dilute the book value per share of the common stock and will increase the number of the Company’s outstanding shares, and upon conversion or exercise would dilute the voting power of the common stock, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease. Depressed trading prices of our common stock could further impair our ability to raise sufficient capital to carry on our business.
We currently have a significant number of outstanding securities that are exercisable for or convertible into our common stock, which could result in significant additional dilution and downward pressure on our stock price. Future issuances of our common stock, including common stock that may be issuable pursuant to outstanding warrants or other convertible securities, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.
In addition to the Cerberus Securities, the Company has issued the IPO Warrants, the 2021 Convertible Notes, the AFG Convertible Notes and warrants issued pursuant to the April, May and December 2023 Public Offering, which are each exercisable for or convertible into common stock at certain exercise or conversion prices per share. See Note 14, 
Warrants Liability 
for further discussion. The issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise or conversion of our warrants or convertible securities would result in significant additional dilution to our current stockholders, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the terms on which we could raise additional capital. If we sell additional shares of common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock.
To the extent that any shares of common stock are issued upon exercise or conversion of any of these securities, there will be an increase in the number of shares of common stock eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of a substantial number of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Provisions in our Charter and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.
Our Charter requires, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Charter or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within 10 days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. If an action is brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder’s counsel. Although we believe that this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Charter provides that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 
31
Although we believe that this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.
Provisions in our Charter may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.
Our Charter contains provisions that may hinder unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make it more difficult to remove management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:
•
no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;
•
a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Board;
•
the right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;
•
a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; 
•
advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company; and
•
the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our Board or the stockholders holding a majority of our shares, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors.
Our stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance. 
Fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of part or all your investment. The trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.
Factors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:
•
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;
•
changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;
•
success of competitors;
•
our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;
•
changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the industries in which we operate in general;
•
operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;
•
our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;
•
changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;
•
commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;
•
changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;
•
the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale;
•
any major change in our board of directors or management;
•
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and
32
•
general economic, political, market conditions such as recessions, inflation, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.
Future resales of our common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.
Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be like us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
We are a “smaller reporting company” and, because we have opted to use the reduced reporting requirements available to us, certain investors may find investing in our securities less attractive.
As a smaller reporting company, we are permitted to comply with scaled-back disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers, including with respect to disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We have elected to adopt the accommodations available to smaller reporting companies. Until we cease to be a smaller reporting company, the scaled-back disclosure in our SEC filings will result in less information about our company being available than for other public companies. If investors consider our common stock less attractive as a result of our election to use the scaled-back disclosure permitted for smaller reporting companies, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.
We are also a non-accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting will not receive the level of review provided by the process relating to the auditor attestation included in annual reports of issuers that are subject to the auditor attestation requirements. In addition, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we rely on these available exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities may be more volatile.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
At Eos, 
we leverage a cybersecurity model that focuses on four key areas: prevention, detection, assessment, and remediation through an array of internal and external systems, along with the 
expertise of third-party service providers
. This model is supported internally by Eos' Information Technology Department ("ITD"), along with expertise of external cybersecurity experts.
 Our model is also supported through security awareness training for all employees during the onboarding process and on a regular basis thereafter.
33
Our Board of Directors has overall oversight responsibility for our cybersecurity model. 
Our overarching cybersecurity programs are under the direction of the 
Eos leadership team and directly supported by the efforts of the ITD. The ITD, led by the Director of ITD, reports to the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO")
 of the Company.

With over 8 years of experience leading cybersecurity teams and programs, our Director of ITD leverages a combination of internal and external systems and security experts to keep our CFO informed of potential risks to the organization.

The Director of ITD is responsible for identifying, considering, and assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures and maintaining cybersecurity programs and systems. 
Management reports material cybersecurity risks to our Board of Directors on an annual basis. In addition, our management follows a risk-based escalation process to notify the Board of Directors outside of the regular reporting cycle when they identify an emerging risk or material issue.
In 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or provide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident.
 For more information about these risks, please see Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
