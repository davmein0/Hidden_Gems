ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of the Company’s operations. While the outcomes of these types of claims are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The following is also disclosed in Note 17, 
Commitments and Contingencies 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Class Action Complaints
On March 8, 2023, a class action lawsuit (the “Delman Complaint”) was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by plaintiff Richard Delman (the “Delman Plaintiff”) against certain defendants including the Company’s former directors (the “Delman Defendants”). Neither the Company nor Eos Energy Storage LLC were named as a defendant in the Delman Complaint, but each was identified as a relevant non-party, and the Company has indemnification obligations relating to the lawsuit. On June 26, 2024, the parties to the Delman Complaint as well as the Company entered into a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release and related documents (collectively, “Settlement Agreement”), pursuant to which the Delman Plaintiff agreed to release all claims against the Delman Defendants in exchange for a settlement payment of $8.5 million (the “Settlement Amount”), funded by the Company’s D&O liability insurers, subject to the Company’s retention of $1.0 million consisting of payment of legal fees of the Delman Defendants. On October 17, 2024, the Court of Chancery approved the Settlement Agreement and entered the Final Judgment subject to the payment of Settlement Amount. On December 10, 2024, the Settlement Amount was fully paid to the Delman Plaintiff by the Company’s D&O liability insurers.

On August 1, 2023, a class action lawsuit (the “Houck Complaint”)  was filed in the United States District Court of New Jersey by plaintiff William Houck (the “Houck Plaintiff”) against the Company and three individual officers: the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, its former Chief Financial Officer, and its current Chief Financial Officer (with the Company, the “Houck Defendants”). The Houck Complaint alleges that the Houck Defendants violated federal securities laws by making knowingly false or misleading statements about the Company’s contractual relationship with a customer and about the size of the Company’s order backlog and commercial pipeline. On November 8, 2024, the District Court granted the renewed motion to dismiss filed by the Houck Defendants. On January 23, 2025, the Company filed a Notice and Request for Entry of Final Judgment with the District Court. The Company is awaiting the District Court’s entry of Final Judgment. 
On November 5, 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit (the “Hyung Complaint”) was filed in the United States District Court of the District of New Jersey by plaintiff Jung Jae Hyung (the “Hyung Plaintiff”) against certain defendants including the Company’s current Chief Executive Officer, the Company’s current Chief Financial Officer, and five of the Company’s current Directors and one former Director (the “Hyung Defendants”). The Hyung Complaint alleges that the Hyung Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by allowing the Company to make knowingly false or misleading statements about the Company’s contractual relationship with a customer and about the size of the Company’s order backlog and commercial pipeline. The Company intends to vigorously contest this matter.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”
Overview
The Company offers an innovative Znyth™ technology battery energy storage system ("BESS") designed to provide the operating flexibility to manage increased grid complexity and price volatility resulting from an overall increase in renewable energy generation and a congested grid coming from an increase in electricity demand growth. The Company’s BESS is a validated chemistry with accessible non-precious earth components in a durable design that is intended to deliver results in even the most extreme temperatures and conditions. The system is designed to be safe, flexible, scalable, sustainable and manufactured in the United States, using raw materials primarily sourced in the United States. We believe the Company’s Z3™ battery module is the core of its innovative systems. The Z3 battery module is the only US designed and manufactured battery module that today provide utilities, independent power producers, renewables developers, and C&I customers with an alternative to lithium-ion and lead-acid monopolar batteries for critical 3- to 12-hour discharge duration applications. We believe the Z3 battery will transform how utility, industrial, and commercial customers store power.
In addition to its BESS, the Company currently offers: (a) a BMS which provides a remote asset monitoring capability and service to track the performance and health of the Company’s BESS and to proactively identify future system performance issues through predictive analytics; (b) project management services to ensure the process of implementing the Company’s BESS are coordinated in conjunction with the customer’s overall project plans; (c) commissioning services that ensure the customer’s installation of the BESS meets the performance expected by the customer; and (d) long-term maintenance plans to maintain optimal operating performance of the Company’s systems
.
The Company’s growth strategy contemplates increasing sales of battery energy storage systems and related software and services through a direct sales team and sales channel partners. The Company’s current and target customers include utilities, project developers, independent power producers and commercial and industrial companies. 
Business Trends
As an SEC-registered and Nasdaq-listed company, we are required to implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices and have, and will continue to, hire additional personnel in this context. We have incurred additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, internal and external accounting, legal, administrative resources, including increased personnel costs, and audit and other professional service fees.
Inflation and cost factors - During 2024, the effects of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in 2022 and in the first half of 2023 had an impact on reducing inflation back towards normal levels. This eased many investor concerns and worked to stabilize the cost of purchasing supplies and raw materials for the Company.
DOE Loan Facility
On November 26, 2024, the Company entered into the DOE Loan Facility. The DOE Loan Facility is a key step in advancing the Company's Project American Made Zinc Energy ("AMAZE") and is expected to fund the expansion of Eos’ manufacturing capacity to 8 GWh by 2027 to meet the growing demand for longer duration battery energy storage systems. The DOE Loan Facility provides for up to $303.5 million in funding, including capitalized interest.
36
The DOE Loan Facility provides for a multi draw term loan facility under a series of at least two and, if the Company elects, up to four tranches of the loan (each, a “Tranche”), subject to the achievement of certain funding conditions, with each Tranche corresponding to the production, maintenance and development, and operation of a given production line to be funded using the proceeds of such Tranche and the principal amount of each Tranche consisting of a maximum principal amount designated for such Tranche in the DOE Loan Facility. Each Tranche provides the Company funding for 80% of the Eligible Project Costs (as defined in the DOE Loan Facility) associated with the corresponding production line, with the Company responsible for funding the remaining 20% of the Eligible Project Costs. 
Through December 31, 2024, the Company has received funding under the DOE Loan Facility for an aggregate amount of $68.3 million, at an interest rate of 4.791% for eligible project costs incurred through December 6, 2024. These costs are a portion of Tranche 1 of the DOE Loan Facility. Tranche 1 provides up to $102.0 million for eligible costs in connection with the design, construction, installation, startup and shakedown of a battery automation line and related tools, with a projected annual production capacity of approximately 1.25 GWh ("Line 1").
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”)
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The IRA has significant economic incentives for both energy storage customers and manufacturers for projects placed in service after December 31, 2022.

One of the most important features of the IRA is that it offers a 10-year term tax credit, whereas historically similar industrial credits have been shorter in duration. Customers placing new energy storage facilities in service, which include our Gen 2.3 and Z3™ BESS, could qualify for an investment tax credit (“ITC”). The IRA also offers an extra ten percent credit if the project is in an “energy community” and another ten percent credit if the project satisfies domestic content requirements. The ten percent bonus for domestic content could represent a strategic advantage for the Company resulting from the Company’s near-sourcing and Made in America strategy, and we believe that projects utilizing Eos batteries qualify for the bonus.
Production Tax Credits under Internal Revenue Code 45X (“PTC”) can be claimed on battery components manufactured in the U.S. and sold to U.S. or foreign customers. These tax credits available to manufacturers include a credit for ten percent of the cost incurred to make electrode active materials in addition to credits of $35 per kWh of capacity of battery cells and $10 per kWh of capacity of battery modules. These credits are cumulative, meaning that companies will be able to claim each of the available tax credits based on the battery components produced and sold through 2029, after which the PTC will begin to gradually phase down through 2032. In April 2024, the IRS issued final regulations related to applicable tax credit transferability and direct pay provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. The Company has reviewed these regulations and believes they do not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Cost of goods sold primarily consists of direct costs relating to labor, material and overhead directly tied to product assembly, procurement and construction (“EPC”), project delivery, commissioning and start-up test procedures. Indirect costs included in cost of goods sold are manufacturing overhead such as equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control procurement, transportation, logistics, depreciation and facility-related costs. As a nascent technology with a new manufacturing process that is early in its product lifecycle, the Company still faces significant costs associated with production start-up, commissioning of various components, modules and subsystems and other related costs. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $3.8 million reduction of cost of goods sold related to the IRA PTC. The Company expects its cost of goods sold to exceed revenues in the near term as it continues to scale production and prepares battery energy storage systems delivered to customers to go-live.
Cost of goods sold increased by $9.1 million, or 10% from $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $98.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in cost of goods sold from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to an increase in project commissioning costs on previously delivered projects, revaluations of inventory balances, along with the underutilization and absorption of labor and overhead associated with implementing the new line.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity and Going Concern
As a growth company in the early commercialization stage of its lifecycle, Eos is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of an enterprise. In this regard, substantially all of the Company’s efforts to date have been devoted to the development and manufacturing of battery energy storage systems and complementary products and services, recruitment of management and technical staff, deployment of capital to expand the Company’s operations to meet customer demand and raising capital to fund the Company’s development. However, as a result of these efforts, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and expects to continue to incur such losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future until such time that the Company can reach a scale of profitability to sustain its operations.
In order to execute its development strategy, the Company has historically relied on outside capital through the issuance of equity, debt and borrowings under financing arrangements (collectively “outside capital”) to fund its cost structure. While the Company believes its recent entry into new credit facilities as discussed below has significantly improved its capital position and provides a path to sustainable operations and profitability, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to achieve such profitability or do so in a manner that does not require additional outside capital. Moreover, while the Company has historically been successful in raising outside capital, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to obtain outside capital in the future or do so on terms that are acceptable to the Company.

As disclosed in Note 3, 
Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, 
on June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a financing transaction with CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP (herein after referred to as “Cerberus”, “Denali”, “Lender”, “Holder”). As a result of this transaction, Cerberus agreed to provide a $210.5 million secured multi-draw facility to be made in four installments (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) as well as a $105.0 million revolving credit facility (“Revolving Facility”), to be made available beginning June 21, 2026, at Cerberus’ sole discretion and only if the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully funded. As of the issuance date, the Delayed Draw Term Loan was fully funded. As part of the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, Cerberus received warrants and preferred stock resulting in a 33% ownership position in the Company as of the issuance date. This ownership percentage represents $644.8 million in market capitalization based on the February 27, 2025 closing share price of the Company’s common stock.

, on November 26, 2024, the Company successfully closed on the DOE Loan Facility, which provides the Company with up to $303.5 million in funding, including capitalized interest, subject to the achievement of certain funding conditions. The DOE Loan Facility provides for a multi draw term loan facility under a series of at least two and, if the Company elects, up to four tranches, subject to the achievement of certain conditions, with each tranche corresponding to the production, maintenance and development, and operation of a given production line to be funded using the proceeds of such tranche. The DOE Loan Facility specifies the maximum amount subject to each tranche (Tranche 1: $102.0 million; Tranche 2: $117.3 million; Tranche 3: $71.8 million; and Tranche 4: $12.3 million), and any amounts which are not withdrawn under a specified tranche cannot be allocated to another tranche. Through December 31, 2024, the Company had drawn down $68.3 million under Tranche 1.
As of the date the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements were issued (the “issuance date”), management evaluated the significance of the following negative financial conditions in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 205-40, Going Concern:  
•
Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash from operations in order to fund its development. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $685.9 million. Adjustments to reconcile the net loss to cash used in operations are primarily from non-cash items on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The non-cash items totaled $549.2 million. The Company incurred negative cash flows from operations of $153.9 million and had an accumulated deficit of $1,561.7 million as of December 31, 2024.
•
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $74.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund the Company’s operations, and working capital of $114.9 million, which includes loan commitment assets of $21.7 million classified as current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
•
On June 21, 2024, upon closing of the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, Cerberus funded the Company $$75.0 million of the initial draw, and the Company received $71.3 million, net of the 5.0% original issue discount. On August 29, 2024, Cerberus funded the Company $30.0 million (“August Draw”), and the Company received $28.5 million, net of the 5.0% original issue discount. On November 1, 2024, Cerberus funded the Company $65.0 million related to the October 31, 2024 tranche (“October Draw” or “October Tranche”), and the Company received $61.8 million, which is net of the 5.0% original issue discount. On January 24, 2025, Cerberus funded the Company the final $40.5 million related to the January 31, 2025 tranche (“January 2025 Draw”). Subsequent to the January 2025 Draw, the Delayed Draw Term Loan has been fully funded.
•
Through December 31, 2024, under the DOE Loan Facility, the Company drew down $68.3 million for the eligible project cost that the Company had incurred through December 6, 2024. These costs are a portion of Tranche 1 of the DOE Loan Facility. Tranche 1 provides up to $102.0 million for eligible costs in connection with the design, construction, installation, startup and shakedown of a battery automation line and related tools. In the event the Company does not achieve certain funding conditions and the DOE chooses not to continue funding, the Company would need to seek alternative sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 
44
•
The Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction and the DOE Loan Facility contain certain quarterly financial covenants, which include (a) Minimum Liquidity, (b) Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, and (c) Minimum Consolidated Revenue (collectively, the “financial covenants”). As of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, the only financial covenant in effect was Minimum Liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with this covenant, as well as all non-financial covenants and expects to remain in compliance with the Minimum Liquidity covenant over the next twelve month beyond the issuance date. The Minimum Consolidated EBITDA and Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenants are effective starting fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Company expects that it may be unable to remain in compliance with the Minimum Consolidated EBITDA and Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenant beginning December 31, 2025, absent the Company’s ability to secure a waiver or amend the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction and the DOE Loan Facility. In the event the Company is unable to comply with the financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2025, and the Company is unable to secure a waiver, Cerberus and DOE may, at their discretion, enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company and/or exercise any and all of their existing rights and remedies, which may include, among other things, asserting their rights in the Company’s assets securing the loans. Moreover, the Company’s other lenders may exercise similar rights and remedies under the cross-default provisions of their respective borrowing agreements with the Company. 
•
In the event the Company’s ongoing efforts to raise additional outside capital are unsuccessful, the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due over the next twelve month beyond the issuance date. In such an event, management will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment in the Company’s operations, a sale of certain of the Company’s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent.  
These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Financing Arrangements
The Company has historically relied on outside capital to fund its cost structure and expects this reliance to continue for the foreseeable future until the Company reaches profitability through its planned revenue generating activities. During 2024, the Company closed on the following capital transactions:
•
Under the ATM offering program, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company sold 16,627,523 shares raising proceeds of $14.1 million, net of fees paid to Cowen, at an average selling price of $0.87 per share.
•
The Company secured a strategic investment of up to $315.5 million from Cerberus. The investment by Cerberus is structured as a $210.5 million Delayed Draw Term Loan to be made in four installments. On June 21, 2024 the first installment of $75.0 million was funded, on August 29, 2024, the second draw of $30.0 million was funded, on October 31, 2024 the third draw of $65.0 million was funded, and on January 24, 2025, the final draw of $40.5 million was funded. As part of the strategic investment, a $105.0 million Revolving Facility can be made available to the Company at the Lenders’ sole discretion and only if the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully funded. 
45
•
On November 26, 2024, the Company entered into the DOE Loan Facility which provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $277.5 million of borrowings and an aggregate capitalized interest of up to $26.0 million. Through December 31, 2024, the Company has drawn down $68.3 million under the DOE Loan Facility, at an interest rate of 4.791% for eligible project costs that the Company has incurred through December 6, 2024. These costs are a portion of Tranche 1 of the DOE Loan Facility, which are related to Line 1. Additional draws under the DOE Loan Facility are subject to our achievement of certain funding conditions, with each Tranche corresponding to the production, maintenance and development, and operation of a given production line to be funded using the proceeds of such Tranche and the principal amount of each Tranche consisting of a maximum principal amount designated for such Tranche in the DOE Loan Facility. Each Tranche provides the Company funding for 80% of the Eligible Project Costs (as defined in the DOE Loan Facility) associated with the corresponding production line, with the Company responsible for funding the remaining 20% of the Project Costs.

 Borrowings, 
and Note 20, 
Shareholders' Equity
 for all of the Company’s outstanding debt and equity transactions.
Capital Expenditures
Although the Company expects capital expenditures and working capital requirements to increase as it seeks to execute its growth strategy, total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $33.2 million and $29.3 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2024 was primarily driven by costs incurred for Phase 2 production of the Z3™ battery system. See Note 7,
 Property, Plant and Equipment
 for further discussion. 
Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows
The Company relies heavily on private placement of convertible notes, term loans, equipment financing and issuance of common stock and warrants. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to funding of debt interest payments, repayment of debt principal, product manufacturing, research and development, and general corporate expenses. The Company’s long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations and capital expenses for capacity expansion and maintenance, equipment upgrades and repair of equipment.

Cash flows from operating activities:
Cash flows used in operating activities primarily comprise of costs related to research and development, manufacturing of products, project commissioning and other general and administrative activities. 
Net cash used in operating activities of $153.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by a net loss of $685.9 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $549.2 million. Non-cash items primarily related to stock compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, gain on debt extinguishment, loss from the write-down of property, plant and equipment, and changes in fair value of debt, warrants and derivatives. The net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $17.2 million was primarily driven by an increase in inventory of $20.5 million, decrease in accrued expenses of $14.7 million, and increase in contract assets of $5.7 million, partially offset by an increase in contract liabilities of $19.7 million. 
46
Net cash used in operating activities of $145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a net loss of $229.5 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $94.2 million. Non-cash items included stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, changes in fair value of warrants and derivatives, and loss from the write-down of property, plant and equipment. The net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $9.7 million was primarily driven by decrease in accounts payable of $11.5 million, increase in contract assets of $6.3 million, increase in other receivables of $7.5 million, and increase in grant receivables of $3.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses of $19.3 million. 
Cash flows from investing activities:
Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 were primarily composed of payments made for purchases of property, plant and equipment of $33.2 million.
Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 were primarily composed of payments made for purchases of property, plant and equipment of $29.3 million, which included costs incurred for development and construction of a fully automated manufacturing line for the Z3™ battery.
Cash flows from financing activities:
Net cash provided by financing activities was $205.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This was primarily due to the proceeds received from the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction of $160.3 million, DOE Loan of $66.6 million, and issuance of common stock of $14.1 million. The proceeds were partially offset by payoff of the Senior Secured Term Loan of $19.9 million, debt issuance costs related to the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction and DOE Loan of $18.1

million, payments on the equipment financing facility of $3.3 million and share repurchases from employees for tax withholding of $1.2 million. 
Net cash provided by financing activities was $227.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was primarily from the issuance of common stock and warrants in the amount of $192.2 million, as well net proceeds received from the issuance of Yorkville Convertible Promissory Notes and AFG Convertible Notes, totaling $48.1 million. The proceeds were partially offset by equity issuance costs of $5.0 million, debt issuance costs related to the Yorkville Convertible Promissory Notes, AFG Convertible Notes and Senior Secured Term Loan of $4.2 million, payments on the equipment financing facility of $2.9 million and share repurchases from employees for tax withholding purposes of $0.6 million.

Critical Accounting Estimates    
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates.
Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Warranty Liability
The Company generally provides a standard warranty for a period of two years. We also provide extended warranties and performance guarantees, which are identified as separate performance obligations in the Company's contracts with customers. We accrue warranty reserves at the time of recording the sale. Warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, which is based on various factors including actual claim data to date, results of lab testing, factory quality data, and field monitoring. Due to limited claim experience since commercialization of our product, and the potential for variability in these underlying factors, the difference between our estimated costs and our actual costs could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. If actual product failure rates or the frequency or severity of reported claims differ from our estimates, we may be required to revise our estimated warranty liability. We will also update actual warranty experience to determine warranty reserves as such experience becomes available. We review our reserves at least quarterly, seeking to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Initial warranty data can be limited at the early stage in the commercialization of our products and, the adjustments that we record may be material. Thus, it is likely that as we sell additional BESS, we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments (See Note 10, 
Accrued Expenses 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
Warrants Liability 
The Company estimated the fair value of the April 2023 warrants, the May 2023 warrants, and the December 2023 warrants using the Black-Scholes model at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This model incorporates inputs such as the stock price of the Company, exercise price, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and time to expiration. The expected volatility involves unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of the fair value calculation to this assumption could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. See Note 16, 
Fair Value Measurement 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
48
Convertible Notes and Embedded Derivatives
The Company estimated the fair value of the embedded conversion features in the 2021 Convertible Notes and the AFG Convertible Notes using a binomial lattice model at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This model incorporates inputs such as the stock price of the Company, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, the effective debt yield and expected volatility. The effective debt yield and volatility involve unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of the fair value calculation to these methods, assumptions, and estimates included could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. See Note 16, 
Fair Value Measurements 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Instruments issued under the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction (see Note 16, Fair Value Measurement)
The fair value of the Delayed Draw Term Loan was estimated using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an effective debt yield. The fair value of the loan commitment asset was estimated using the discounted cash flow model, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at the effective debt yield and considering the probability of achieving certain milestones. The fair value for the SPA Warrant is estimated based on its intrinsic value, using the Eos common stock closing price adjusted by a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”), less the exercise price of $0.01 for the SPA Warrant. A DLOM was applied considering the underlying shares of the SPA Warrants are unregistered. The fair value of the Contingent Warrants is estimated based on the underlying Eos common stock closing price adjusted by a DLOM using a Black-Scholes model, considering the probability of achieving certain milestones. A DLOM was applied considering the underlying shares of the Contingent Warrants are unregistered. The fair values for all these instruments are designated as level 3 measurements as they rely on significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs for each of these instruments are detailed in Note 16, 
Fair Value Measurement
), which include debt yield, DLOM, and milestones achievement expectations. The sensitivity of the fair value calculation to debt yield, DLOM, and milestones achievement expectations could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and in the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. Our exposure to liquidity risk is dependent on our ability to raise funds to meet our obligations and sustain operations. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring our actual and forecasted working capital requirements to ensure there is capital to meet short-term, long-term obligations, including our financial covenants under the DOE Loan Facility and Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction (see Note 13, 
Borrowings 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As disclosed in Note 1, 
Overview 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, there is a substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In order to execute its development strategy, the Company has historically relied on outside capital to fund its cost structure and expects to continue to rely on outside capital for the foreseeable future. While the Company believes it will eventually reach a scale of profitability to sustain its operations, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to achieve such profitability or do so in a manner that does not require its continued reliance on outside capital. Moreover, while the Company has historically been successful in raising outside capital, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to obtain outside capital in the future or do so on terms that are acceptable to the Company.
Equity Price Risk
Equity price risk arises from security price volatility. The Company is subject to this risk due to the warrants issued, since they are measured at fair value. See Note 16, 
Fair Value Measurement 
for warrant valuations and fair values, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ deficit, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and may be unable to remain in compliance with financial covenants required by borrowing arrangements absent the Company’s ability to secure additional outside capital or obtain a waiver, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Convertible Notes Payable and Warrants Liability -

Refer to Notes 13, 14 and 16 to the financial statements 
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s 2021 Convertible Notes and AFG Convertible Notes (collectively “the Convertible Notes”) contain embedded conversion features that are required to be bifurcated from the Convertible Notes and measured at fair value at each reporting period. The Company estimates the fair value of the embedded conversion features using a binomial lattice model at the inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This model incorporates inputs such as the stock price of the Company, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, the effective debt yield, and expected volatility. The effective debt yield and the expected volatility involve unobservable inputs. 
The Company’s April 2023 Transaction, May 2023 Transaction, and the December 2023 Public Offering include warrants that are required to be measured at fair value at each reporting period. The Company estimates the fair value of the warrants using a Black-Scholes model at the inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This model incorporates inputs such as the stock price of the Company, exercise price, risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and time to expiration. The expected volatility involves unobservable inputs.
Unlike the fair value of financial instruments that are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of the embedded conversion features and warrants is inherently subjective and involves the use of complex modeling tools. Auditing the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the (1) embedded conversion features in the Convertible Notes and (2) warrants included the following, among others: 
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s valuation methodology and the significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants by:
◦
Testing the source information underlying the fair value of the embedded conversion features and the warrants and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
◦
Developing an independent estimate of the inputs and compared those to the inputs used in the fair value of the embedded conversion features and warrants. 
•
We evaluated the competency and objectivity of management’s expert engaged by the Company to perform the valuation of the embedded conversion features and warrants.
Financial Instruments Associated with the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction - Refer to Notes 3, 13, 14 and 16 to the financial statements 
Critical Audit Matter Description
On June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a (1) credit and guaranty agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP, and (2) Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with CCM Denali Equity Holdings, LP (collectively, CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP and CCM Denali Equity Holdings, LP referred to as “Cerberus”) (collectively, the Credit Agreement and the SPA referred to as “Cerberus Agreements”). 
In conjunction with the Cerberus Agreements, the Company also entered into a payoff letter agreement with ACP Post Oak Credit I LLC and other Atlas Lenders to settle all outstanding obligations under the Atlas Credit Agreement, which were deemed paid and satisfied in full.
53
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, Cerberus agreed to provide a (1) $210.5 million secured multi-draw facility to be made in four installments (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) upon the achievement of certain performance milestones on dates specified in the Credit Agreement, and (2) $105.0 million revolving credit facility, to be made available beginning June 21, 2026, at Cerberus’ sole discretion and only if the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully funded. 
Under the terms of the SPA, the Company issued the following (1) a warrant to purchase 43,276,194 shares of Common Stock (the “SPA Warrant”), (2) 59 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and (3) upon the achievement of performance milestones on dates specified in the Credit Agreement, the Company issued at the option of Cerberus, preferred stock or warrants on common stock, up to an aggregate of 33.0% ownership limitation on a fully diluted basis at such time the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully drawn (the “Contingent Warrants”). The Contingent Warrants were settled in Preferred Stock upon the successful funding of the Delayed Draw Term Loan on dates specified in the Credit Agreement.
Auditing the accounting for the instruments issued under the Cerberus Agreements, and the settlement of the obligations under the Atlas Credit Agreement, requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve professionals in our firm with expertise in financial instruments.
The Credit Agreement contains loan commitment assets, which are required to be measured at fair value upon inception (June 21, 2024), with no subsequent remeasurement. The Company estimates the fair value of the loan commitment asset using the discounted cash flow model, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at the effective debt yield and considering the probability of achieving certain milestones. The milestone achievement expectations and the effective debt yield involve unobservable inputs.
The Company estimates the fair value of the debt issued under the Delayed Draw Term Loan at inception and on subsequent valuation dates using a discounted cash flow method, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at the effective debt yield.  The effective debt yield involves unobservable inputs.
The Company estimates the fair value for the SPA warrant issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement at inception and on subsequent valuation dates based on its intrinsic value, using the Company’s common stock closing price adjusted by a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”), less the exercise price. The DLOM involves unobservable inputs. 
The Company estimates the fair value of the Contingent Warrants issued under the Securities Purchase Agreement at inception and on subsequent valuation dates based on the Company’s common stock closing price adjusted by a DLOM using Black-Scholes option pricing model, considering the probability of achieving certain milestones. The milestone achievement expectations, the expected volatility, and the DLOM involve unobservable inputs.
Unlike the fair value of financial instruments that are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of the financial instruments associated with the Cerberus Agreements is inherently subjective and involves the use of complex modeling tools. Auditing the fair value of the financial instruments associated with the Cerberus Agreements requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the (1) accounting of the instruments issued under the Cerberus Agreements, and the settlement of the obligations under the Atlas Credit Agreement, and (2) valuation of the financial instruments associated with the Cerberus Agreements included the following, among others: 
•
With the assistance of professionals in our firm with expertise in financial instruments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management’s accounting conclusions related to (1) the financial instruments issued under the Cerberus Agreements, and (2) the settlement of the obligations under the Atlas Credit Agreement.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s valuation methodology and the significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the financial instruments issued under the Cerberus Agreements by:
54
◦

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. 
Overview 
Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Eos”) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets innovative energy storage solutions for utility-scale, microgrid, and commercial & industrial (“C&I”) applications. Eos developed a broad range of intellectual property with multiple patents covering unique battery chemistry, mechanical product design, energy block configuration and a software operating system (Battery Management System). The Company has only 
one
 operating and reportable segment. See Note 22, 
Segment Reporting
, for further discussion. 
Liquidity and Going Concern
As a growth company in the early commercialization stage of its lifecycle, Eos is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of an enterprise. In this regard, substantially all of the Company’s efforts to date have been devoted to the development and manufacturing of battery energy storage systems and complementary products and services, recruitment of management and technical staff, deployment of capital to expand the Company’s operations to meet customer demand and raising capital to fund the Company’s development. However, as a result of these efforts, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and expects to continue to incur such losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future until such time that the Company can reach a scale of profitability to sustain its operations.
In order to execute its development strategy, the Company has historically relied on outside capital through the issuance of equity, debt and borrowings under financing arrangements (collectively “outside capital”) to fund its cost structure. While the Company believes its recent entry into new credit facilities as discussed below has significantly improved its capital position and provides a path to sustainable operations and profitability, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to achieve such profitability or do so in a manner that does not require additional outside capital. Moreover, while the Company has historically been successful in raising outside capital, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to obtain outside capital in the future or do so on terms that are acceptable to the Company.
As disclosed in Note 3, 
Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, 
on June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a financing transaction with CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP (herein after referred to as “Cerberus”, “Denali”, “Lender”, “Holder”). As a result of this transaction, Cerberus agreed to provide a $
210,500
 secured multi-draw facility to be made in 
four
 installments (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) as well as a $
105,000
 revolving credit facility (“Revolving Facility”), to be made available beginning June 21, 2026, at Cerberus’ sole discretion and only if the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully funded. As of the issuance date, the Delayed Draw Term Loan was fully funded. As part of the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, Cerberus received warrants and preferred stock resulting in a 
33
% ownership position in the Company as of the issuance date. This ownership percentage represents $
644,823
 in market capitalization based on the February 27, 2025 closing share price of the Company’s common stock.
As disclosed in Note 13, 
Borrowings
, on November 26, 2024, the Company successfully closed on the DOE Loan Facility, which provides the Company with up to $
303,450
 in funding, including capitalized interest, subject to the achievement of certain funding conditions. The DOE Loan Facility provides for a multi draw term loan facility under a series of at least 
two
 and, if the Company elects, up to 
four
 tranches, subject to the achievement of certain conditions, with each tranche corresponding to the production, maintenance and development, and operation of a given production line to be funded using the proceeds of such tranche. The DOE Loan Facility specifies the maximum amount subject to each tranche (Tranche 1: $
101,979
; Tranche 2: $
117,326
; Tranche 3: $
71,836
; and Tranche 4: $
12,309
), and any amounts which are not withdrawn under a specified tranche cannot be allocated to another tranche. Through December 31, 2024, the Company had drawn down $
68,279
 under Tranche 1.
As of the date the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements were issued (the “issuance date”), management evaluated the significance of the following negative financial conditions in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 205-40, Going Concern:  
62
Table of Contents
EOS ENERGY ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. Overview (cont.)
•
Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash from operations in order to fund its development. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of $
685,870
. Adjustments to reconcile the net loss to cash used in operations are primarily from non-cash items on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The non-cash items totaled $
549,174
. The Company incurred negative cash flows from operations of $
153,936
 and had an accumulated deficit of $
1,561,716
 as of December 31, 2024.
•
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
74,292
 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund the Company’s operations, and working capital of $
114,937
, which includes loan commitment assets of $
21,731
 classified as current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
•
On June 21, 2024, upon closing of the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, Cerberus funded the Company $
75,000
 of the initial draw, and the Company received $
71,250
, net of the 
5.0
% original issue discount. On August 29, 2024, Cerberus funded the Company $
30,000
 (“August Draw”), and the Company received $
28,500
, net of the 
5.0
% original issue discount. On November 1, 2024, Cerberus funded the Company $
65,000
 related to the October 31, 2024 tranche (“October Draw” or “October Tranche”), and the Company received $
61,750
, which is net of the 
5.0
% original issue discount. On January 24, 2025, Cerberus funded the Company the final $
40,500
 related to the January 31, 2025 tranche (“January 2025 Draw”). Subsequent to the January 2025 Draw, the Delayed Draw Term Loan has been fully funded.
•
Through December 31, 2024, under the DOE Loan Facility, the Company drew down $
68,279
 for the eligible project cost that the Company had incurred through December 6, 2024. These costs are a portion of Tranche 1 of the DOE Loan Facility. Tranche 1 provides up to $
101,979
 for eligible costs in connection with the design, construction, installation, startup and shakedown of a battery automation line and related tools. In the event the Company does not achieve certain funding conditions and the DOE chooses not to continue funding, the Company would need to seek alternative sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 
•
The Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction and the DOE Loan Facility contain certain quarterly financial covenants, which include (a) Minimum Liquidity, (b) Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, and (c) Minimum Consolidated Revenue (collectively, the “financial covenants”). As of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, the only financial covenant in effect was Minimum Liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with this covenant, as well as all non-financial covenants and expects to remain in compliance with the Minimum Liquidity covenant over the next twelve month beyond the issuance date. The Minimum Consolidated EBITDA and Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenants are effective starting fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Company expects that it may be unable to remain in compliance with the Minimum Consolidated EBITDA and Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenant beginning December 31, 2025, absent the Company’s ability to secure a waiver or amend the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction and the DOE Loan Facility. In the event the Company is unable to comply with the financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2025, and the Company is unable to secure a waiver, Cerberus and DOE may, at their discretion, enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company and/or exercise any and all of their existing rights and remedies, which may include, among other things, asserting their rights in the Company’s assets securing the loans. Moreover, the Company’s other lenders may exercise similar rights and remedies under the cross-default provisions of their respective borrowing agreements with the Company. 
•
In the event the Company’s ongoing efforts to raise additional outside capital are unsuccessful, the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due over the next twelve month beyond the issuance date. In such an event, management will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment in the Company’s operations, a sale of certain of the Company’s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. Overview (cont.)
These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
2.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. In the Consolidated Statements of Operations, Gross profit (loss) has been introduced, reflecting Total revenue less Cost of goods sold. This addition does not impact the reported Net loss.

Foreign Currency
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 830, 
Foreign Currency Matters
. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of their respective countries as their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The operating results of foreign operations are translated at weighted average exchange rates. The related translation gains or losses are reported as a separate component of shareholders’ deficit in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which were insignificant for years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are included as other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Allowance for Expected Credit Losses
The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers. If the collection of any specific receivable is doubtful, an allowance is recorded in the allowance for expected credit losses.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowances for expected credit loss related to Accounts Receivable was $
40
 and $
26
, respectively. The Company also has an immaterial allowance related to its Notes Receivable, net, which is included in Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Embedded derivatives
Some of our debt and preferred stock financings contain embedded features, such as conversion features and redemption features. The Company evaluates each agreement to determine whether the embedded feature requires bifurcation from the host instrument, in which case would require to be accounted for as a derivative liability. The Company uses valuation models to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivatives. The change in fair value of the embedded derivatives is presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Earnings (loss) Per Share
In accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 260, 
Earnings per Share
, basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Preferred Series B is a participating security that does not have the obligation to share in the losses of the Company. Therefore, the more dilutive of the “if-converted” and “two-class” method must be applied when calculating EPS for the common shares. Management has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value of the Series B Preferred Stock. At each balance sheet date, the redemption value of the Series B Preferred Stock will be calculated, and if the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, the carrying value will be accreted to the redemption value. The accretion is recorded as a deemed dividend, which, in the absence of Retained earnings, reduces additional paid in capital and earnings available to common shareholders in computing basic and diluted EPS. Other potentially dilutive common shares and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating EPS on a diluted basis.
 See Note 21, 
Earnings Per Share
 for further information. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, contract assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, warrants, notes payable — related party, contract liabilities, and long-term debt.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, contract assets, contract liabilities and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. 
Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Goodwill
Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year using a qualitative or quantitative process that is performed at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a likely reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(cont.)
Prior to performing a quantitative evaluation, an assessment of qualitative factors may be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value. If it is determined that it is unlikely that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the Company is not required to complete the quantitative goodwill impairment evaluation. If it is determined that the carrying value may exceed fair value when considering qualitative factors, a quantitative goodwill impairment evaluation is performed. When performing the quantitative evaluation, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded.
The Company completed the annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2024, using a qualitative assessment for the reporting unit. The Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount, and a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not necessary.
 As a result of the annual assessment, there were 
no
 impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An assessment is performed to determine whether the depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets over their remaining lives can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of any long-lived asset impairment is measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which a long-lived assets impairment is determined by management.

Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes
The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of FASB ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
 ("ASC 740"). Income taxes are computed under the asset and liability method reflecting both current and deferred taxes, which reflect the tax impact of all events included in the financial statements. The balance sheet approach (i) reflects a current tax liability or asset recognized for estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current and prior years, (ii) reflects a deferred tax liability or asset recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards, (iii) measures current and deferred tax liabilities and assets using the enacted tax rate of which the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated, and (iv) reduces deferred tax assets, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets only to the extent that management concludes these assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized. Significant judgement is required in assessing and estimating the more-likely-than-not tax consequences of the events included in the financial statements. Management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (i) management determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.

Intangible Assets, net
Intangible assets are stated at their historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives.
Inventory

(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(cont.)
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company records inventory when it takes delivery and title to the product according to the terms of each supply contract.
The Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. A valuation allowance is recorded for inventories that management considers excess or obsolete. Management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.
Leases
The Company accounts for its leases under ASU 2016-02, 
Leases 
(“ASC 842”). Under ASC 842, the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate the present value represents our collateralized incremental borrowing rate and is calculated based on the treasury yield curve that is commensurate with the term of each lease, and a spread representative of our borrowing costs. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases may be classified as either operating leases or finance leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are excluded from the scope of ROU assets and liabilities, as allowed by ASC 842.
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected the practical expedient to account for non-lease components as part of the lease component for all asset classes. The majority of the Company's lease agreements are real estate leases.
Property, Plant and Equipment, net
Equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the life of the lease. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred. Expenditures which significantly improve or extend the life of an asset are capitalized. 
Construction in Progress
Included in property, plant, and equipment is construction in progress. Costs related to the design, development, and construction of large capital projects are accumulated in construction in progress until the project is complete. A construction project is considered substantially complete upon the cessation of construction and development activities. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated useful life. A portion of construction in progress also includes capitalized interest. Interest costs incurred during construction of large capital projects are capitalized as construction in progress until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. Interest is capitalized using a weighted average effective interest rate applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period to which it is applied.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, which include materials, supplies, salaries, benefits and other costs related to research, development and testing of products.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(cont.)
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is earned from the sales, installation, and commissioning of BESS, the terms of which are dictated by supply agreements the Company enters into with its customers. Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods and/or services to the customer. As most contracts contain multiple goods or services delivered to the customer at different times, the transaction price is allocated to each good or service based on the relative standalone selling price and revenue is recognized when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company uses either the expected cost-plus margin approach or adjusted market assessment approach to estimate the standalone selling prices of its goods and services. 
Product Revenue
Product revenue is comprised of revenue from the BESS, along with other products, including marshalling cabinets, spare parts, transformers and inverters. It is recognized when control transfers, as determined by the specific terms outlined in each contract.  If not specifically defined in the contract, the timing around the transfer of control is based on the shipping terms, which vary by contract, but are generally either Delivered-at-Place ("DAP") Destination or Exworks. Many of the Company’s contracts with customers contain some component of variable consideration. The Company estimates variable consideration, such as refunds, penalties including liquidated damages, and the customer’s right to return, using the expected value method, and adjusts transaction price for its estimate of variable consideration. We update our estimates of variable consideration and adjust the transaction price accordingly by recording an adjustment to net revenue and refund liability with respect to variable consideration such as penalties, refunds, and credits to customers. The Company has concluded that its estimation of variable consideration results in an adjustment to the transaction price such that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur in the future.
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. Sales tax collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and therefore, not included in revenue. Sales tax is recorded as a liability (payable) until remitted to governmental authorities.
Service Revenue
Service revenue includes commissioning, installation and engineering, procurement and construction revenue. As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance, these performance obligations are satisfied over time. The Company uses an input method to measure progress towards satisfaction. If at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue, a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss is recorded at that time. 
Warranty related revenue
In addition to a standard 
two-year
 limited warranty against defects, the Company offers customers the option to purchase an extended warranty, a maintenance and monitoring service and/or a performance guarantee. As the standard 
two-year
 limited warranty is classified as an assurance-type warranty, based on criteria set forth in ASC 606, it is not accounted for as a separate performance obligation. The extended warranty, maintenance and monitoring service warranty and performance guarantee, however, represent distinct services and are accounted for as separate performance obligations based on a time-lapsed measure of progress resulting in a ratable recognition of revenue over the respective performance period. For these performance obligations, at any time if management determines that in the case of a particular warranty that total costs will exceed total warranty revenue, a provision for the entire anticipated warranty loss is recorded at that time and included in warranty liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
The Company recognizes contract assets for certain contracts in which revenue recognition performance obligations have been satisfied, however invoicing to the customer has not yet occurred. Contract liabilities primarily relate to consideration received from customers in advance of the Company’s satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Payment terms are generally aligned with meeting various contractual milestones, beginning with purchase order execution and extending through manufacturing release, ready to ship, delivery and commissioning. 
Practical Expedients and Exemptions
As permitted by ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”)
, the Company elected to use certain practical expedients. 
•
The Company treats costs associated with obtaining new contracts as expenses when incurred if the amortization period of the asset recognized by the Company is one year or less.
•
The Company has elected to exclude sales and other similar taxes from the transaction price. 
•
If shipping and handling activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the good, the Company has elected to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfil the promise to transfer the good. All elections are consistently applied to similar transactions.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company's stock-based compensation expense consists of:
•
Stock options.
•
Restricted stock units awards ("RSU").
•
Performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSU”).
•
Performance-based milestone awards ("Milestone PRSU").
Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. For stock option awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value. For RSUs and Milestone PRSUs, the Company uses the Company's stock price on date of grant to estimate fair value. For PRSUs, the fair value is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation in an option pricing framework.
The Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the award vesting period. Stock options generally have a term of 
five
 to 
ten years
 and vest over periods ranging from 
three months
 to 
two years
. RSUs generally vest over periods from 
one
 to 
three years
. PRSUs generally vest over 
two
 to 
three years
. For PRSUs and Milestone PRSUs, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis based on management’s estimation of achievement of performance conditions (see Note 18, 
Stock Based Compensation
 for further discussion). The Company recognizes forfeitures as incurred.
Warranty liability 
Warranty obligations are incurred in connection with the sale of the Company’s products. Costs to provide for warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as a liability at the time of recording the sale. Warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, which is based on various factors, including the use of actual claim data to date, results of lab testing, factory quality data, and field monitoring.

Series A and B Preferred Stock
As discussed in Note 3, 
Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, 
the Company issued shares of (1) Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock (collectively "Series A Preferred Stock") in June 2024 and August 2024, respectively, which were subsequently converted into shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2

Preferred Stock, respectively, in September 2024, and (2) Series B-3 Preferred Stock in November 2024 (collectively, with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and Series B-3 Preferred Stock, the “Series B Preferred Stock” and together with Series A Preferred Stock, “the Preferred Stock”). The Preferred Stock is redeemable based upon the passage of time and therefore meets the criteria to be classified within temporary equity. Management has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value pursuant to ASC 480-10-S99-3A-15(b). As a result, the Company will remeasure the Preferred Stock to the maximum redemption value at each reporting date but will never be adjusted below its initial carrying value. Adjustments are reflected in Additional paid in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Production Tax Credits under Internal Revenue Code 45X (“PTC”)
Since the PTC is a refundable credit (i.e., a credit with a direct-pay option available), the PTC is outside the scope of ASC 740. Therefore, the Company accounts for the PTC under a government grant model. GAAP does not address the accounting for government grants received by a business entity that are outside the scope of ASC 740. The Company’s accounting policy is to analogize to IAS 20, 
Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance,
 under IFRS Accounting Standards. Under IAS 20, once it is reasonably assured that the entity will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant money is recognized on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognizes the related expenses or losses for which the grant money is intended to compensate. The Company recognizes grants once it is probable that both of the following conditions will be met: (1) the Company is eligible to receive the grant and (2) the Company is able to comply with the relevant conditions of the grant. The PTC is a non-monetary asset since the Company’s intention is to sell the tax credit to a third-party and is recorded at the value that is expected to be received from the sale in Grant Receivable, net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently recognized in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss when the inventory is sold. In the event the PTC is sold, upon the receipt of the cash payments, 
the Company will record offsets to Grant Receivable, net
. Differences in the recorded value of the PTC and the sale price will be recognized as an adjustment to cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Fair Value Option
The Company has elected the option under ASC 825-10, 
Financial Instruments 
("ASC 825"), to measure the Delayed Draw Term Loan, including all tranches of fundings received in 2024 (see Note 3, C
redit and Securities Purchase Transaction
) at fair value. The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. When the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for such instrument is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss at each subsequent reporting date. Upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred. These amounts are included in Other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The gains or losses attributable to changes in instrument-specific risk are included in Change in fair value of debt – credit risk in Accumulated other comprehensive Loss.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, 
Disclosure Agreements - Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative
. This amendment will impact various disclosure areas, including the statement of cash flows, accounting changes and error corrections, earnings per share, debt, equity, derivatives, and transfers of financial assets. The amendments in this ASU 2023-06 will be effective on the date the related disclosures are removed from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K by the SEC, and will no longer be effective if the SEC has not removed the applicable disclosure requirement by June 30, 2027. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact this amendment could have on its disclosures.

3. Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction 
(cont.)
On November 26, 2024, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement Amendment”), by and among the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors party thereto and the Lender, pursuant to which among other things, the applicability of the Consolidated Revenue and EBITDA financial covenants were deferred until December 31, 2025 and certain provisions were amended to conform with comparable provisions in the DOE Loan Facility. See Note 13, 
Borrowings
, for further discussion.
Securities Purchase Agreement
On June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with CCM Denali Equity Holdings, LP (the “Purchaser”).
SPA Warrant
Under the SPA, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 
43,276,194
 shares of common stock representing a collective ownership of 
19.9
% (the “SPA Warrant”) of our outstanding shares of (inclusive of Series A-1 Preferred Stock – see below) common stock prior to the issuance. The SPA Warrant has a 
ten-year
 term and an exercise price of $
0.01
 per share. The SPA Warrant includes anti-dilutive rights, subject to certain excluded issuances, in the event any shares of common stock, options, warrants, convertible securities or other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in common stock are issued at a price per share of less than the fair market value (as defined in the Warrant) of a share of common stock on the issuance date of the Warrant, subject to adjustment. Until the Company received stockholder approval on September 10, 2024, the Company could not issue additional shares of common stock exceeding 
19.99
% of shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of the Initial Draw (such percentage, as may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Warrant, the “Conversion Cap”) upon exercise of the Warrant, and would have been required to issue, at the option of the Lender, Series A Preferred Stock or additional warrants on common stock upon a draw under the Delayed Draw Term Loan. Following shareholder approval received, the Conversion Cap increased to 
49.9
% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the applicable measurement date; and the holder of the Warrant has the option to amend the Conversion Cap to any percentage less than 
49.9
%. 
The SPA Warrant is exercisable at the holder’s discretion for cash or on a cashless basis. The SPA Warrant is subject to automatic cashless exercise on the expiration date if the fair market value of one share is greater than the exercise price then in effect. Upon an acceleration under the Credit Agreement, the Company may be required to purchase the SPA Warrant from the holder at an amount equal to the closing sale price of underlying common stock less the SPA Warrant exercise price at the request of the holder. The SPA Warrant meets the criteria for liability classification under ASC 480 and is recognized at fair value with changes in fair value included in Change in fair value of derivatives - related parties in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Contingent Warrants
Upon the achievement of performance milestones on dates specified in the Credit Agreement, the Company  received additional funds and issued at the option of the Lender, Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock, if prior to shareholder approval or Series B Preferred Stock if after shareholder approval) or warrants on common stock (collectively “Contingent Warrants”) under the SPA in an amount equal to the applicable percentage, up to an aggregate of 
33.0
% ownership limitation on a fully diluted basis at such time the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully drawn. The applicable percentage is subject to increase by up to 
8.0
% to up to 
41.0
% on a fully diluted basis to the extent that milestones are not met on the final measurement date on April 30, 2025, in which case additional Contingent Warrants would be issuable. The Contingent Warrants meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 480. As such, the Contingent Warrants are included in Warrants liability - related party on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as of December 31, 2024. The change in fair value of the Contingent warrants is included in Change in fair value of derivatives - related parties on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. See Note 14, 
Warrants Liability

 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to satisfy the terms of the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Series A-1 Certificate of Designation, each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock had an original issue price of $
455,822.59
 (the “A-1 Original Issue Price”) and a liquidation value, payable with the common stock, as if such shares were convertible into an aggregate of 
31,940,063
 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment. The Series A-1 Preferred Stock was non-voting and non-convertible into common stock.  Holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock were entitled to receive dividends or distributions on each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock equal to dividends or distributions actually paid on each share of common stock, multiplied by the number of shares of common stock represented by the Series A-1 Preferred Stock Liquidation Value (as defined in the Series A-1 Certificate of Designation).
The 
59
 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Cerberus converted into shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock once stockholder approval was obtained on September 10, 2024. See Series B Preferred Stock discussion below.

9,555,515.30
 (the “A-2 Original Issue Price”) and a liquidation value, payable pari passu with the common stock, as if such share was convertible into an aggregate of 
28,806,463
 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment. The Series A-2 Preferred Stock was non-voting and non-convertible into common stock. Holders of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock were entitled to receive dividends or distributions on each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock equal to dividends or distributions actually paid on each share of common stock, multiplied by the number of shares of common stock represented by the Series A-2 Preferred Stock Liquidation Value (as defined in the Series A-2 Certificate of Designation). The Series A-2 Preferred Stock terms were substantially identical to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.  
On August 29, 2024, in connection with the August Draw, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement between the Company and Cerberus, the applicable percentage increased by 
4.9
%, and as a result the Company issued to Cerberus

Government Grants
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”)
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The IRA has significant economic incentives for both energy storage customers and manufacturers for projects placed in service after December 31, 2022. Starting in 2023, there are PTCs, which can be claimed on battery components manufactured in the U.S. and sold to U.S. or foreign customers. The tax credits available to manufacturers include a credit for ten percent of the cost incurred to make electrode active materials in addition to credits of $35 per kWh of capacity of battery cells and $10 per kWh of capacity of battery modules. These credits are cumulative, meaning that companies will be able to claim each of the available tax credits based on the battery components produced and sold through 2029, after which the PTC will begin to gradually phase down through 2032. 
In April 2024, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations (Final Regulations) on the transferability of certain energy tax credits, pursuant to Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,

which was enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Company has reviewed these regulations and believes they do not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

11. Government Grants 
(cont.)
In October 2024, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations (Final Regulations) to provide guidance on the PTC established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The company has reviewed these regulations and believes they do not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Since the PTC is a refundable credit (i.e., a credit with a direct-pay option available), the PTC is outside the scope of ASC 740. Therefore, the Company accounts for the PTC under a government grant model. GAAP does not address the accounting for government grants received by a business entity that are outside the scope of ASC 740. The Company’s accounting policy is to analogize to IAS 20, 
Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance,
 under IFRS Accounting Standards. Under IAS 20, once it is reasonably assured that the entity will comply with the conditions of the grant, the grant money is recognized on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognizes the related expenses or losses for which the grant money is intended to compensate. The Company recognizes grants once it is probable that both of the following conditions will be met: (1) the Company is eligible to receive the grant and (2) the Company is able to comply with the relevant conditions of the grant.  
The PTC is recorded as the applicable items become finished goods and the conditions in the preceding paragraph are met.
During the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into tax credit purchase agreements to sell and transfer all of the PTCs related to the production and sale of battery cells and battery modules produced in calendar years 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, that were eligible to be claimed on the Company’s tax returns for the related years. The transferred tax credits were sold at 
90
% of their value and the cash purchase price of the PTCs was $
3,430
. 
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into tax credit purchase agreements to sell and transfer all of the PTCs related to the production and sale of electrode active materials produced in calendar year 2023, that were eligible to be claimed on the Company’s tax return. The transferred tax credits were sold at 
90
% of their value and the cash purchase price of the PTCs was $
812
.
Cash was received from the buyer in April, June, and October of 2024, after the completed registration requirements were filed through the IRS‑provided electronic portal, inclusive of registration numbers needed to claim the credit on the Buyer’s tax return. Upon the receipt of the cash payments, 
the Company recorded offsets to the PTC/G
rant Receivable account. There were no differences between the recorded fair value of the PTC receivable and the amount of consideration received. Future differences, if any, will be recognized as an adjustment to cost of goods sold. 
The Company recognized PTC credits of $
3,789
 and $
3,256
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a reduction of cost of goods sold on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, grant receivable related to the PTC in the amount of $
2,283
 and $
3,256
, respectively, is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Delayed Draw Term Loan (“DDTL”)
As discussed in Note 3, Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, on June 21, 2024, the Company borrowed an Initial Draw of $
75,000
, and received $
70,075
, net of the 
5.0
% original issue discount and lender fees paid. On August 29, 2024, the Company met the first tranche milestones and submitted a borrowing request under the Credit Agreement for the scheduled $
30,000
, and received $
28,500
, net of the 
5.0
% original issue discount. On October 31, 2024, the Company met the second tranche milestones and submitted a borrowing request under the Credit Agreement for the scheduled $
65,000
, and received $
61,750
, net of the 
5.0
% original issue discount. On January 24, 2025, the Company announced the achievement of all four of the third tranche milestones previously agreed upon between Eos and Cerberus. Achieving these performance milestones enabled the Company to draw an additional $
40,500
 on January 24, 2025, upon the Company’s achievement of certain applicable funding milestones. See Note 23, 
Subsequent events
 for additional information on this draw. See Note 3, 
Credit Agreement and Securities Purchase Transaction
 for additional information on this transaction.
Each tranche under the Delayed Draw Term Loan is subject to a 
5.0
% original issue discount payable at the time of each draw. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are subject to certain fees, including (i) an exit fee equal to 
5.0
% of the aggregate principal amount of Loans, or Revolving Loans being paid, repaid, prepaid, refinanced or replaced in a prepayment event, (ii) a make-whole payment for certain prepayments prior to March 31, 2028, as amended on November 26, 2024 and (iii) a prepayment premium for any prepayments prior to the scheduled maturity date.

Milestones
In the event the Company fails to achieve any of the remaining milestones under the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction on the one additional milestone measurement date, the Company will not receive the specific tranche unless waived by the Lender, the Company will be subject to a penalty represented by an up to 
4.0
% increase in the applicable percentage in the form of additional Warrants or Preferred Stock at the final missed milestone measurement date, which could result in the issuance of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Warrants up to an applicable percentage increase of up to 
16.0
% for all missed milestones, or up to a 
49.0
% overall applicable percentage taking into account the 
33.0
% applicable percentage. If the Company fails to achieve an interim milestone, but then subsequently achieves the final milestone for that particular category, the incremental penalty equity related to that milestone category is returned to the Company. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had met all applicable interim milestones resulting in a maximum applicable percentage increase of 
8.0
% for the remaining interim milestones, or up to 
41.0
% overall applicable percentage considering the 
33.0
% applicable percentage. On January 24, 2025, the Company announced the achievement of all four of the third performance milestones previously agreed upon between the Company and Cerberus. As a result of meeting the third performance milestones, if the Company fails to achieve the remaining milestones as of the final milestone measurement date, the applicable percentage will be subject to up to a 
4.0
% increase for the missed milestones or an increase in the overall applicable percentage of up to 
37.0
%. See Note 23, 
Subsequent Events
 for additional information.
Covenants
On November 26, 2024, the Company amended the Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors party thereto and the Lender, pursuant to which among other things, the applicability of the Consolidated Revenue and EBITDA financial covenants were deferred until December 31, 2025 and certain provisions were amended to conform with comparable provisions in the DOE Loan Facility.
The Credit Agreement, as amended, contains the following financial covenants, including (each as defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended):
•
Minimum Consolidated EBITDA- not applicable for December 31, 2024.
•
Minimum Consolidated Revenue- not applicable for December 31, 2024.
•

The Company elected the fair value option to account for all draws under the Delayed Draw Term Loan for operational purposes. The financial liability was initially measured at its issue-date fair value and is subsequently remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The Company also elected the fair value option for the August Draw and the October Draw. The Initial Draw fair value, the August Draw fair value, as well as the October Draw fair value (collectively the "DDTL"), was $
25,653
, $
12,528
, and $
28,340
 respectively, at issuance. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value for the DDTL was $
76,188
. A gain of $
33,823
 was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024. This is included in Change in fair value of debt - related party on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company also recorded a loss attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk of $
43,490
 for the year ended December 31, 2024. This is included in Change in fair value of debt - credit risk in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. 
The Company did not separately report interest expense attributable to the DDTL because such interest was included in the determination of the fair value of the Note. See Note 16, 
Fair Value Measurement
 for the assumptions used to determine the fair value the Delayed Draw Term Loan at issuance and at December 31, 2024.
Contractual Interest Rates 
- Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to 
15.0
% per annum, subject to the following increases: (i) an additional 
5.0
% per annum upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement. The Company may elect to add accrued and unpaid interest on the loans to the principal amount of the loans (capitalized interest).
Maturity 
- The DDTL is scheduled to mature on the earlier of (i) June 15, 2034 as amended on November 26, 2024, and (ii) 
91
 days prior to the maturity of certain of the Company’s outstanding convertible notes. See Note 3, 
Credit Agreement and Securities Purchase Transaction
 for additional information on this transaction.
2021 Convertible Notes Payable - Related Party
On July 6, 2021, the Company entered into an investment agreement with Spring Creek Capital, LLC, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Koch Industries. The investment agreement provides for the issuance and sale to Koch of convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $
100,000
. The maturity date of the 2021 Convertible Notes is June 30, 2026, subject to earlier conversion, redemption or repurchase.
Contractual Interest Rates
 - The 2021 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 
5
% per year if interest is paid in cash, or 
6
% per year if interest is paid in-kind. Interest on the 2021 Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30. 
Conversion Rights 
- The 2021 Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time until the business day prior to the maturity date, including in connection with a redemption by the Company. The 2021 Convertible Notes will be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 
49.9910
 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $
20.00
 per share, in each case subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments. The Company has the right to settle conversions in shares of common stock, cash, or any combination thereof.
Optional Redemption
 - On or after June 30, 2024, the 2021 Convertible Notes will be redeemable by the Company in the event that the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides the redemption notice at a redemption price of 
100
% of the principal amount of such 2021 Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
If, following the Company’s delivery of a redemption notice, the 2021 Convertible Notes are converted pursuant to the holders’ conversion rights, the Company is required to make an additional cash payment to the converting holder equal to the present value of all interest payments the holder would have been entitled to receive had such 2021 Convertible Notes remained outstanding until June 30, 2026 (the “interest make-whole payment”). The present value is calculated using a discount rate equal to the risk-free rate plus 
50
 basis points and assuming interest accrued at the cash interest rate of 
5
% per year.

Contingent Redemption 
- With certain exceptions, upon the occurrence of certain events, fundamental changes described in the 2021 Convertible Notes Agreement, the holders of the 2021 Convertible Notes may require that the Company repurchase all or part of the principal amount of the Notes at a purchase price of 
100
% of the principal amount of such 2021 Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
Embedded Derivatives 
- The interest make-whole payment can be triggered only in connection with an induced conversion, and therefore represents an adjustment to the settlement amount of the embedded conversion feature. Because this adjustment is calculated in a manner in which the cash payout may exceed the time value of the embedded conversion feature, the embedded conversion feature is precluded from being considered indexed to the Company’s own stock. Therefore, the embedded conversion feature does not qualify for the scope exceptions to derivative accounting prescribed by ASC 815.

20
% of the Project Costs. 
The DOE Loan Facility specifies the maximum amount subject to each tranche (Tranche 1: $
101,979
; Tranche 2: $
117,326
; Tranche 3: $
71,836
; and Tranche 4: $

On January 18, 2023, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with the Purchasers relating to the issuance and sale to the Purchasers of $

Conversion Rights 
- The AFG Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (the “Conversion Option”) at any time until the business day prior to the maturity date, including in connection with a redemption by the Company. The AFG Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, based on an initial conversion price of approximately $
1.67
 per share subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments. The Company has the right to settle conversions in shares of common stock, cash, or any combination thereof. 
Optional Redemption
 - On or after June 30, 2024, provided that the Company has obtained stockholder approval, the AFG Convertible Notes are redeemable by the Company in the event that the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides the redemption notice. The redemption price will be equal to the then current principal amount of the AFG Convertible Notes (inclusive of all PIK Interest), plus the aggregate amount of all interest payments on the AFG Convertible Notes that the holders of the AFG Convertible Notes to be redeemed would have been entitled to receive had the AFG Convertible Notes remained outstanding to the maturity date. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not sought stockholder approval. 
Contingent Redemption 
- With certain exceptions, upon the occurrence of certain events and fundamental changes described in the AFG Convertible Notes Agreement, the holders of the AFG Convertible Notes may require that the Company repurchase all or part of the principal amount of the AFG Convertible Notes at a purchase price of 
100
% of the principal amount of the AFG Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
Embedded Derivative 
- The Conversion Option includes an exercise contingency, which requires the Company to obtain shareholder approval for conversions subject to the Exchange Cap. If shareholder approval is not obtained, following commercially reasonable efforts, the Company will be required to settle the conversion in excess of the Exchange Cap in cash. Since settlement in cash may be required in absence of shareholder approval, the embedded conversion feature fails the equity classification guidance in ASC 815 and is thus precluded from being classified in equity. Therefore, the embedded conversion feature is required to be bifurcated from the AFG Convertible Notes and accounted for at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
The fair value of the AFG Convertible Notes at issuance was $
16,623
, which was greater than the proceeds received. The Company recorded the difference of $
2,873
 as interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

On July 29, 2022 (the "Closing Date"), the Company entered into a $
100,000
 Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement with Atlas Credit Partners (ACP) Post Oak Credit I LLC (Atlas), as administrative agent for the Atlas Lenders and collateral agent for the secured parties. The Senior Secured Term Loan was scheduled to mature on the earlier of (i) July 29, 2026, and (ii) 
91
 days prior to the current maturity date of the 2021 Convertible Notes of June 30, 2026. The Company had the right at any time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part in an amount of not less than $
500
.
The outstanding principal balance of the Senior Secured Term Loan bore interest, at the applicable margin plus, at the Company’s election, either (i) the benchmark secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), which is a per annum rate equal to (y) the Adjusted Term SOFR plus 
0.2616
%, or (ii) the alternate base rate (“ABR”), which is a per annum rate equal to the greatest of (x) the U.S. Prime Lending Rate, (y) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement) plus 
0.5
% and (z) the SOFR. The applicable margin under the Credit Agreement was 
8.5
% per annum with respect to SOFR loans, and 
7.5
% per annum with respect to ABR loans. Interest on the Senior Secured Term Loan accrued at a variable interest rate, and interest payments are due quarterly. The Company may elect to convert SOFR Loans to ABR (and ABR Loans to SOFR). 
Interest was required to be escrowed based on the principal outstanding. This amount was $
11,755
 at December 31, 2023. This escrowed amount was classified as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Termination of the Senior Secured Term Loan
On June 21, 2024, the Atlas Credit Agreement, and the subsequent commitment increase agreements thereto, which provided for a $
100,000
 Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement, were terminated pursuant to the terms of the Atlas Payoff Letter and the Insurer Letter Agreement, and all security interests and other liens granted to or held by the Atlas Lenders were terminated and released. 
In accordance with the Atlas Payoff Letter, the Company agreed to payoff the Senior Secured Term Loan for (a) approximately $
11,900
 (which was released from the interest escrow account maintained pursuant to the Atlas Credit Agreement and (b) $
1,000
 for the account of Atlas; provided that Atlas agreed to accept a participation in the Credit Agreement in lieu of such $
1,000
 payment, and (c) $
8,000
. In accordance with the Insurer Letter Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Atlas Insurers (i) on December 31, 2024, subject to the absence of certain events of default under the Credit Agreement, $
3,000
 and (ii) on June 30, 2025, subject to the absence of certain events of default under the Credit Agreement, $

Yorkville Convertible Promissory Notes - Related Party
In December 2022, February 2023, March of 2023, and April 2023, the Company issued convertible promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $
37,000
 in a private placement to Yorkville under the second and third supplemental agreements to the SEPA. The fair values of the convertible promissory notes at issuance were greater than the proceeds received. Accordingly, the Company recorded the excess of fair value of these promissory notes over the proceeds as Interest expense - related parties in the amount of $
17,571
, for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
During the first half of 2023, Yorkville delivered Investor Notices requiring the Company to issue and sell an aggregate of 
22,947,029
 shares of common stock to Yorkville to offset all outstanding amounts owed to Yorkville under the outstanding convertible promissory notes. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment from the issuance of common stock from the outstanding convertible promissory notes of $
3,510
 for the for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
The conversion feature for each of the convertible promissory notes did not qualify for the scope exception to derivative accounting, therefore the conversion option was bifurcated from each convertible promissory note. The bifurcated derivatives were recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and subject to remeasurement at the debt extinguishment date, with changes in fair value recognized as a realized gain or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Net gain of $

SPA Warrant
As discussed in Note 3, 
Credit Agreement and Securities Purchase Transaction, 
the Company issued to the Purchaser, one warrant to purchase 
43,276,194
 shares of common stock. The warrant has a 
Ten-year
 term, a $
0.01
 per share exercise price, and is exercisable at the Purchaser’s discretion for cash or on a cashless basis. Upon an acceleration under the Credit Agreement, the Company could be required to purchase the warrant from the holder at an amount equal to the most recently quoted price. Following stockholder approval on September 10, 2024, the Conversion Cap increased to 
49.9
%. See Note 3, 
Credit Agreement and Securities Purchase Transaction
 for additional information on this transaction.
Contingent Warrants
Following the Initial Draw, on 
three
 separate predetermined draw dates (for the third draw, see Note 23, 
Subsequent Events)
 upon the achievement of the corresponding performance milestone for each such draw date, the Company received additional funds under the Credit Agreement and issued securities under the SPA in an amount equal to the applicable percentage, up to an aggregate of 
33.0
% ownership limitation on a fully-diluted basis as of the time the Delayed Draw Term Loan was fully drawn. Although these contingent warrants were not issued or exercisable until additional draws occurred, they meet the guidance under ASC 480 and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The applicable percentage is subject to increase by 
8.0
% to up to 
41.0
% on a fully diluted basis to the extent that milestones are not met on the final measurement date on April 30, 2025, in which case additional Contingent Warrants would be issuable.

Fair Value Measurement
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, contract assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, warrants, notes payable — related party, contract liabilities, and long-term debt.
Accounting standards require financial assets and liabilities to be classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, contract assets, contract liabilities and accounts payable, and DOE Loan Facility are considered to be representative of their fair value.

Accounting for instruments resulting from the Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction
The Loan commitment assets were measured at fair value as of June 21, 2024 (see Note 3,

76,091
 at issuance calculated using the discounted cash flow model. They will not be subsequently remeasured at fair value.

The fair value of each draw of the Delayed Draw Term Loan was estimated using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at a debt yield and considering the probability of achieving certain milestones. 
The fair value for the SPA warrant is estimated based on its intrinsic value, using the Eos common stock closing price adjusted by a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”), less the exercise price of $
0.01
 for the SPA Warrant. A DLOM was applied considering the underlying shares of the SPA Warrants are unregistered. 
The fair value of the Contingent Warrants is estimated based on the underlying Eos common stock closing price adjusted by a DLOM using Black-Scholes option pricing model, considering the probability of achieving certain milestones. A DLOM was applied considering the underlying shares of the Contingent Warrants are unregistered. 
The fair values for all the above instruments are designated as level 3 measurements as they rely on significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs for each of these instruments are disclosed in the tables below. All other inputs used are observable.

Commitments and Contingencies
Lease commitments
The Company has lease commitments under lease agreements. See Note 15, 
Leases,
 for additional information. 
Minimum Volume Commitment
In June 2022, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement with a minimum volume commitment with a third party, which provides services to process certain raw materials. Any purchase order issued under this supply agreement will be non-cancellable. To the extent the Company fails to order the guaranteed minimum volume defined in the contract at the end of the term, the Company is required to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the shortfall, if any, multiplied by a fee. The Company is currently negotiating a new long-term supply agreement with the counterparty. As part of the ongoing negotiations, during the fourth quarter, the Company paid the counterparty $
1,250
 as a shortfall penalty and transferred equipment with a net book value of approximately $
600
. As a result, the Company has been released of any minimum volume commitments as part of the original agreement. 
Legal Proceedings
Class Action Complaints
On March 8, 2023, a class action lawsuit (the “Delman Complaint”) was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by plaintiff Richard Delman (the “Delman Plaintiff”) against certain defendants including the Company’s former directors (the “Delman Defendants”). Neither the Company nor Eos Energy Storage LLC were named as a defendant in the Delman Complaint, but each was identified as a relevant non-party, and the Company has indemnification obligations relating to the lawsuit. On June 26, 2024, the parties to the Delman Complaint as well as the Company entered into a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release and related documents (collectively, “Settlement Agreement”), pursuant to which the Delman Plaintiff agreed to release all claims against the Delman Defendants in exchange for a settlement payment of $
8,500
 (the “Settlement Amount”), funded by the Company’s D&O liability insurers, subject to the Company’s retention of $
1,000
 consisting of payment of legal fees of the Delman Defendants. On October 17, 2024, the Court of Chancery approved the Settlement Agreement and entered the Final Judgment subject to the payment of Settlement Amount. On December 10, 2024, the Settlement Amount was fully paid to the Delman Plaintiff by the Company’s D&O liability insurers.

17. Commitments and Contingencies 
(cont.)
On August 1, 2023, a class action lawsuit (the “Houck Complaint”)  was filed in the United States District Court of New Jersey by plaintiff William Houck (the “Houck Plaintiff”) against the Company and 
three
 individual officers: the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, its former Chief Financial Officer, and its current Chief Financial Officer (with the Company, the “Houck Defendants”). The Houck Complaint alleges that the Houck Defendants violated federal securities laws by making knowingly false or misleading statements about the Company’s contractual relationship with a customer and about the size of the Company’s order backlog and commercial pipeline. On November 8, 2024, the District Court granted the renewed motion to dismiss filed by the Houck Defendants. On January 23, 2025, the Company filed a Notice and Request for Entry of Final Judgment with the District Court. The Company is awaiting the District Court’s entry of Final Judgment. 
On November 5, 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit (the “Hyung Complaint”) was filed in the United States District Court of the District of New Jersey by plaintiff Jung Jae Hyung (the “Hyung Plaintiff”) against certain defendants including the Company’s current Chief Executive Officer, the Company’s current Chief Financial Officer, and 
five
 of the Company’s current Directors and 
one
 former Director (the “Hyung Defendants”). The Hyung Complaint alleges that the Hyung Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by allowing the Company to make knowingly false or misleading statements about the Company’s contractual relationship with a customer and about the size of the Company’s order backlog and commercial pipeline. The Company intends to vigorously contest this matter.

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company granted contingent shares to select key executives that may be earned based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over a 
two
 and 
three-year
 period following the grant date. TSR awards are paid out in stock at the end of the vesting period based on the Company’s stock performance. The performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of the Company’s common stock relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000 index peer group for the two and three-year period following the grant date. This peer group includes the entire Russell 2000 index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that were removed from the index during the performance period. The payment of awards following the 
two
 and 
three-year
 award period is based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the initial grant. The fair value of the TSR awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation in an option pricing framework.

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company also granted shares contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones related to the Credit Agreement that may be earned over the performance period following the grant date. The contingent share awards (“Milestone PRSU”) are paid out in stock at the end of the vesting period based on the Company’s achievement of the performance milestones. 
As of December 31, 2024, there was $

 of unrecognized compensation expense attributable to unvested PRSUs, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of

18. Stock-Based Compensation 
(cont.)
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company granted 
40,000
 RSUs with performance and service conditions. Stock compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the award vesting term. For awards with performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period. The performance conditions primarily relate to achievement of sales and financing targets. In June 2023, the Company modified 
550,000
 performance-based stock options that were issued in June 2022 and December 2022 by extending the period to meet certain performance conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2023, all performance conditions were met for these 
550,000
 options, therefore accelerating the vesting and respective expense.

The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") mandated that research and experimental ("R&E") costs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 must be capitalized and amortized over five years if the research is performed in the United States and over 15 years if performed outside the United States. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has capitalized and will amortize these costs over the required periods.
The Company maintains a valuation allowance where it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance are included in the Company’s income tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, carry back and carry forward periods and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. The Company has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that it will not be able to utilize its U.S. deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 due to a history of cumulative losses. As such, the Company has a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.

19. Income Taxes 
(cont.)
The valuation allowance increased by $
46,442
 between December 31, 2024 and 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards and impact of the DDTL transaction. At December 31, 2024, the valuation allowance is $
222,122
, of which $
11,006
 would be allocated to equity if released. The remaining valuation allowance of $
211,116
 would be released through continuing operations. 
Net Operating Losses & Tax Credits
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has federal research and development tax credits (“R&D credit”) of approximately $
3,733
 for both years, which begin to expire in varying amounts from 2031 – 2038, subject to the annual limitation described below. In addition, the Company has state R&D credits of approximately $
65
 for the year ended December 31, 2023, which expired in 2024.
The Company has NOL carryforwards for tax purposes and other deferred tax assets that are available to offset future taxable income, subject to the annual limitation described below.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has gross federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $
741,178
 and $
638,507
, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has state NOL carryforwards of $
1,032,728
 and $
228,333
, respectively. Regarding the federal NOL, for the year ended December 31, 2024, $
89,051
 begins to expire in varying amounts from 2032 through 2036, while $
652,127
 has an indefinite carryforward period. Regarding the state NOL carryforwards for the year ended December 31, 2024, $
1,023,378
 begins to expire in varying amounts from 2028 through 2044, while $
9,350
 has an indefinite carryforward period. The U.S. (federal and state) operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to the “change in ownership” provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and similar state provisions. In 2020, the Company determined that the merger transaction constitutes a change of ownership as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and Section 383. The Company completed an ownership shift analysis through December 31, 2024 and determined that an ownership change occurred during the 2024 tax year within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Based on our ownership change limitation study, the timing of the Company’s ability to utilize its pre-change federal NOLs and tax credits may be limited subject to the Section 382 limitation. However, we do not expect that the limitation due to the ownership change will result in any of the NOLs expiring unutilized as a significant amount have an indefinite life carryforward. Assuming there is sufficient projected taxable income, a majority of the Section 382 limited net operating losses will be available prior to the year ended December 31, 2029.   Management believes such limitation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements as the Company is currently in a net loss position, and the deferred tax asset on the Company’s NOL carryforward is offset by a full valuation allowance.  Based on management’s 2020 Section 383 limitation analysis, it is expected that as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $
3,733
 of federal R&D credits will expire unused. 
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. There are two major corporate tax provisions included in the Act. In general, the IRA creates a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on any corporation that has (or has had) average annual “adjusted financial statement income” for a three-year period preceding the tax year that exceeds $1 billion. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA also imposes on publicly traded U.S. corporations a 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of their stock. The excise tax is effective for stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect the aforementioned provisions in the IRA to have any material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In addition to the CAMT discussed above, the IRA has production tax credits that are discussed in Note 11, 
Government Grants.

(cont.)
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state), India, and Italy. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining the Company’s provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (i) management determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 
The Company has unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 as follows:

Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31
$
1,571

$
680

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $
1,571
 and $
680
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits in 2024 was related to an impermissible method of accounting for payroll costs.
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024 are potential benefits of 
nil
 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. The open tax years for federal returns are 2021 and forward, and the open tax years for state returns are generally 2019 and forward. Net operating losses and R&D credits generated in closed years and utilized in open years are subject to adjustment by the tax authorities. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS related to tax year 2022. The Company is not under examination by any other taxing jurisdictions. 
The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its provision for income tax contingencies in accordance with ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. As a result, the Company may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the impact of new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretation of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with tax authorities and lapses of statute of limitations.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company sold 
16,627,523
 shares raising proceeds of $
14,089
, net of fees paid to Cowen, at an average selling price of $
0.87

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 
37,126,137
 shares raising proceeds of $
92,916
, net of fees paid to Cowen, at an average selling price of $
2.58
 per share, included in the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Equity.
21. 
Earnings Per Share
Generally, basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The SPA Warrant and Preferred Series B are participating securities that do not have the obligation to share in the losses of the Company. Therefore, the more dilutive of the “if-converted” and “two-class” method must be applied when calculating EPS for the common shares. 
Management has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value of the Series B Preferred Stock. At each balance sheet date, the redemption value of the Series B Preferred Stock will be calculated, and if the redemption

value is greater than the carrying value, the carrying value will be accreted to the redemption value. The accretion is recorded as a deemed dividend, which, in the absence of Retained earnings, reduces additional paid in capital and earnings available to common shareholders in computing basic and diluted EPS. Other potentially dilutive common shares and the related impact to earnings are considered when calculating EPS on a diluted basis.
Since the Company incurred a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as the year ended December 31, 2023, the potential dilutive shares from stock options, restricted stock units, warrants, and convertible notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented. Therefore, basic and diluted EPS are computed using the same number of weighted-average shares for the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as the year ended December 31, 2023. 
The following potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as the year ended December 31, 2023:

Segment Reporting
The Company’s chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer and President. Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the CODM in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates in 
one
 operating and 
one
 reportable segment.
The Company designs, develops, manufactures, and markets innovative zinc-based energy storage solutions for utility-scale, microgrid and commercial & industrial (C&I) applications. The Company operates and holds long-lived assets in a single geographical region, with nearly all of its revenue coming from customers in the United States. 
The CODM reviews financial information on a consolidated basis and uses Gross profit (loss) and Net income (loss) to assess financial performance considering budget-to-actual variances when making key decisions on how to allocate company resources.

Subsequent Events
On January 24, 2025, the Company announced the achievement of all 
four
 of the third performance milestones previously agreed upon between Eos and Cerberus pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Achieving these performance milestones enabled the Company to draw an additional $
40,500
 from the Delayed Draw Term Loan. On January 24, 2025, Cerberus funded the full amount of the scheduled $
40,500
 draw under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, completing the scheduled fundings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan.
In connection with the final scheduled draw and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the SPA, the Applicable Percentage increased by 
2.1
%, and the Company issued to Cerberus 
16.150528
 shares of a newly designated non-voting Series B-4 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “Series B-4 Preferred Stock”), which are convertible into an aggregate of 
16,150,528
 shares of common stock. Collectively, the SPA Warrant, the Series B Preferred Stock, and the newly created Series B-4 Preferred Stock are exercisable or convertible into, as applicable, an aggregate of 
158,433,112
 shares of common stock, or an Applicable Percentage of 
33.0
% as of the issuance date.
Under the terms of the Series B-4 Certificate of Designation, each share of Series B-4 Preferred Stock has an original issue price of $
5,990
.
As a result of meeting the third performance milestones, if the Company fails to achieve the remaining milestones as of the final milestone measurement date, the applicable percentage will be subject to up to a 
4.0
% increase for the missed milestones or an increase of the overall applicable percentage of up to 
37.0
%.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, including the CEO and CFO, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on our assessment, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses 
As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to: a lack of a formalized internal control framework in accordance with COSO, inadequate segregation of duties within the financial reporting process, lack of review and approval of journal entries, and a lack of management review controls. To address these material weaknesses, management, with oversight of the Audit Committee, implemented the following steps to remediate the material weaknesses: 
•
We engaged external experts to complement internal resources and to provide support related to more complex applications of GAAP, tax, and internal controls. 
•
We designed and implemented a comprehensive internal control framework that includes a formal risk assessment process to identify and design our control activities to address all risks of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud. 
•
We designed and implemented systematic manual journal entry review workflows.
•
We designed and implemented IT general controls over the review of user access rights and privileges and implemented more robust review procedures over change management and segregation of duties. 
•
We developed a formalized process and control documentation for all relevant areas of financial reporting, including IT general and automated controls that support financial reporting.
Table of Contents
•
We designed and implemented a comprehensive segregation of duties framework and implemented relevant segregation of duties controls, including restricting the ability for one individual to both (i) create and post a journal entry in the general ledger and (ii) prepare and review account reconciliations.
•
We designed and implemented management review controls over each significant class of transaction, including areas considered highly complex, judgmental, and subject to management estimation. 
•
We have designed procedures to validate underlying source data used in our financial reporting controls and the necessary IT general and automated controls to rely on the IT environment supporting our financial reporting.
•
We designed and implemented controls to identify any significant and unusual transactions, and analyze, record, report, and disclose such matters. 
As of December 31, 2024, our testing of both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls was completed, and management has concluded that the previously identified material weaknesses have been fully remediated.
Other than the changes described above related to our remediation of the previously identified material weaknesses, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting which were identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
