MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2025 and 2024. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report because that disclosure was already included in our 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2024
, filed with the SEC on May 15, 2024. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, for a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.
Overview
We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of specialty chemicals and ingredients that we formulate, manufacture, blend and distribute, for our Water Treatment, Industrial, and Health and Nutrition customers. 
Financial Overview 
Highlights of fiscal 2025 include: 
•
Sales of $974.4 million, an increase of $55.2 million, or 6% from fiscal 2024;
•
Gross profit of $225.5 million, an increase of $31.9 million, or 16% from fiscal 2024; and
•
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.03, an increase of $0.44, or 12%, from fiscal 2024.
We focus on total profitability dollars when evaluating our financial results as opposed to profitability as a percentage of sales, as sales dollars tend to fluctuate as raw material prices rise and fall, particularly in our Water Treatment and Industrial segments. The costs for certain of our raw materials can rise or fall rapidly, causing fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of sales.
We use the last in, first out (“LIFO”) method of valuing the majority of our inventory in our Water Treatment and Industrial segments, which causes the most recent product costs to be recognized in our income statement. The LIFO inventory valuation method and the resulting cost of sales are consistent with our business practices of pricing to current chemical raw material prices. Inventories in our Health and Nutrition segment are valued using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method.
We disclose the sales of our bulk commodity products as a percentage of total sales dollars for our Water Treatment and Industrial segments. Our definition of bulk commodity products includes products that we do not modify in any way, but receive, store, and ship from our facilities, or direct ship to our customers in large quantities. We disclose the percentage of our overall sales that consist of sales of bulk commodity products as these products are generally distributed and we do not add significant value to these products in comparison to our non-bulk products. Sales of these products are generally highly competitive and price sensitive. As a result, bulk commodity products generally have our lowest margins.
Factors Affecting Comparability of Results
Business Acquisitions
On January 31, 2025, we acquired substantially all the assets of Amerochem Corporation ("Amerochem") under the terms of a purchase agreement with Amerochem and its shareholders. Amerochem distributed water treatment chemicals and equipment to its customers primarily throughout North Carolina. The results of operations since the acquisition date and the assets are included in our Water Treatment segment. 
On October 30, 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Waterguard, Inc. ("Water Guard") under the terms of a purchase agreement with Water Guard and its shareholders. Water Guard distributed water treatment chemicals and equipment to its customers primarily throughout North Carolina. The results of operations since the 
acquisition date and the assets are included in our Water Treatment segment. 
17
On June 28, 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Wofford Water Service, Inc. ("Wofford") under the terms of a purchase agreement with Wofford and its shareholders. Wofford distributed water treatment chemicals and equipment to customers mainly in Mississippi. The results of operations since the acquisition date and the assets are included in our Water Treatment segment. 
On June 3, 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Intercoastal Trading, Inc. and certain related entities ("Intercoastal") under the terms of a purchase agreement with Intercoastal and its shareholders. Intercoastal distributed water treatment chemicals and equipment to its customers in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. The results of operations since the acquisition date and the assets are included in our Water Treatment segment. 
The aggregate annual revenue of these four businesses acquired in fiscal 2025 totaled approximately $67 million, as determined using the applicable twelve-month period preceding each respective acquisition date. 
Recent Developments
After the end of the fiscal year, on April 25, 2025, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Surplus Management, Inc. dba WaterSurplus ("WaterSurplus") for approximately $150 million, and may be obligated to pay up to an additional $53.7 million based on achieving certain earnings targets five years after the closing of the acquisition. WaterSurplus delivers sustainable water treatment solutions throughout the United States focused on membrane separation systems, engineering and design services, media filtration systems, new equipment and rental unit manufacturing and sales, along with rapid-response PFAS removal solutions for “forever chemicals”. WaterSurplus serves municipal water customers as well as customers in the food and beverage industry, offering patented products within its filtration business that reduce the frequency of membrane cleaning resulting in lower energy costs, downtime, and lower overall operational costs.

Fiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024
Sales
Sales were $974.4 million for fiscal 2025, an increase of $55.2 million, or 6%, from sales of $919.2 million for fiscal 2024. The year-over-year increase was driven by sales growth in our Water Treatment segment, while sales in our Industrial and Health and Nutrition segments declined year over year. 
Water Treatment Segment.
  Water Treatment segment sales increased $83.2 million, or 23%, to $446.5 million for fiscal 2025, as compared to $363.3 million for fiscal 2024. Sales of bulk commodity products in the Water Treatment segment were approximately 9% of sales dollars in both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. Sales increased as a result of $72 million of added sales from acquired businesses as well as increased sales volumes of 5% in our legacy business.
18
Industrial Segment.
  Industrial segment sales decreased $27.0 million, or 7%, to $382.5 million for fiscal 2025, as compared to $409.5 million for fiscal 2024. Sales of bulk commodity products in the Industrial segment were approximately 15% of sales dollars in fiscal 2025 and 14% of sales dollars in fiscal 2024. Although total sales volume was up slightly year over year, sales declined due to lower selling prices on certain products and product mix changes. 
Health and Nutrition Segment.
 Health and Nutrition segment sales decreased $0.9 million, or 1%, to $145.5 million for fiscal 2025, as compared to $146.4 million for fiscal 2024. An increase in sales of our distributed products was largely offset by decreased sales of our manufactured products. The overall decrease in sales of our manufactured products was driven by decreased sales of a lower-margin product.
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $31.9 million, or 16%, to $225.5 million, or 23% of sales, for fiscal 2025, from $193.6 million, or 21% of sales, for fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2025, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profits increased, by $1.6 million, primarily due to lower prices year-over-year on certain products. In fiscal 2024, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profits increased, by $15.4 million. Included as a reduction to gross profit in the prior year was a $7.7 million charge to operating expense for an environmental liability related to perchlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) discovered in the soil at our Rosemount, MN, facility.
Water Treatment Segment.
  Gross profit for the Water Treatment segment increased $23.1 million, or 23%, to $121.6 million, or 27% of sales, for fiscal 2025, from $98.5 million, or 27% of sales, for fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2025, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profits increased, by $0.5 million. During fiscal 2024, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profit increased, by $3.3 million. Gross profit increased as a result of the increased sales.
Industrial Segment.
  Gross profit for the Industrial segment increased $5.1 million, or 8%, to $72.6 million, or 19% of sales, for fiscal 2025, from $67.5 million, or 16% of sales, for fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2025, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profits increased, by $1.1 million. In fiscal 2024, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profits increased, by $12.1 million. Included as a reduction to gross profit in the prior year was a $7.7 million charge to operating expense for an environmental liability related to PCBs discovered in the soil at our Rosemount, MN, facility. Gross profit increased as a result of the environmental charge in the prior year not repeating in the current year, partially offset by the negative year-over-year impact of the change in the LIFO reserve, as well as improved margins on certain products.
Health and Nutrition Segment.
  Gross profit for our Health and Nutrition segment increased $3.7 million, or 13%, to $31.3 million, or 22% of sales, for fiscal 2025, from $27.6 million, or 19% of sales, for fiscal 2024. Gross profit increased as a result of a favorable product mix shift.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses increased $16.8 million, or 19% to $106.4 million, or 11% of sales, for fiscal 2025, from $89.6 million, or 10% of sales, for fiscal 2024. Expenses increased largely due to $10.4 million in added costs from the acquired business in our Water Treatment segment, including amortization of intangibles of $4.2 million, as well as increased variable costs.
Operating Income
Operating income increased $15.2 million, or 15%, to $119.2 million, or 12% of sales, for fiscal 2025, as compared to $104.0 million, or 11% of sales, for fiscal 2024, due to the combined impact of the factors discussed above. 
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense was $5.4 million for fiscal 2025, an increase of $1.2 million from interest expense of $4.3 million for fiscal 2024. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding borrowings in the current year, primarily to fund current year acquisitions. 

Income Tax Provision
Our effective tax rate was approximately 26% for both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. The effective tax rate is impacted by projected levels of annual taxable income, permanent items, and state taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025 was $111.1 million compared to $159.5 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by increases in customer receivables as a result of higher sales, as well as higher inventory levels, partially offset by an increase in net income. Due to the nature of our operations, which includes purchases of large quantities of bulk chemicals, the timing of purchases can result in significant changes in working capital and the resulting operating cash flow. Historically, our cash requirements for working capital increase during the period from March through November as inventory levels increase as most of our barges are received during this period. 
Cash used in investing activities was $128.0 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $122.5 million in fiscal 2024. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $41.1 million in fiscal 2025 and $40.2 million in fiscal 2024. Cash used in investing activities included Water Treatment group acquisition spending of $87.4 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $83.5 million of acquisition spending in fiscal 2024.
Cash used in financing activities was $14.8 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $37.4 million in fiscal 2024. Cash used in financing activities included net debt borrowings of $50.0 million in fiscal 2025 and net debt repayments of $13.0 million in fiscal 2024. We paid out cash dividends of $14.6 million in fiscal 2025 and $13.2 million in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, we used $20.7 million to repurchase shares under our board-authorized share repurchase program, and in fiscal 2024, we used $11.3 million to repurchase shares under the program.
Our cash balance was $5.1 million at March 30, 2025, a decrease of $2.1 million as compared with March 31, 2024. Cash flows generated by operations during fiscal 2025 were offset by the cash expended for acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments of debt, dividend payments and share repurchases in fiscal 2025. 
20
We are party to the Credit Agreement with U.S. Bank and the lenders which provides us with the Revolving Loan Facility totaling $400.0 million. The Revolving Loan Facility includes a $10 million letter of credit subfacility and $25 million swingline subfacility. The Revolving Loan Facility has a five-year maturity date, maturing on April 25, 2030. The Revolving Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and those of our subsidiaries. At March 30, 2025, we had $149 million outstanding under the Revolving Loan Facility.
Borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one of the following, plus, in both cases, an applicable margin based upon our leverage ratio: (a) Term SOFR for an interest period of one, three or six months as selected by us, reset at the end of the selected interest period, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) U. S. Bank’s prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or (3) one-month Term SOFR for U.S. dollars plus 1.0%. The Term SOFR margin is between 1.0% and 1.85%, depending on our leverage ratio. The base rate margin is between 0.00% and 0.85%, depending on our leverage ratio. At March 30, 2025, the effective interest rate on our borrowings was 4.3%.
In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Revolving Loan Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee is between 0.15% and 0.25%, depending on our leverage ratio.
Debt issuance costs paid to the Lenders are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement. As of March 30, 2025, the unamortized balance of these costs was $0.2 million, and is reflected as a reduction of debt on our balance sheet.
The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 and (b) a maximum total cash flow leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0, subject to an election by us to increase the maximum total cash flow leverage ratio to 4.0 to 1.0 after certain Permitted Acquisitions subject to limitations set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of significant assets, make certain investments, including any acquisitions other than permitted acquisitions, make certain payments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, grant liens on our assets or enter into rate management transactions, subject to certain limitations. We are permitted to make distributions, pay dividends and repurchase shares so long as no default or event of default exists or would exist as a result thereof. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of March 30, 2025 and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants for the next 12 months.
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including failure to comply with covenants in the Credit Agreement and other loan documents, cross default to other material indebtedness, failure by us to pay or discharge material judgments, bankruptcy, and change of control. The occurrence of an event of default would permit the lenders to terminate their commitments and accelerate loans under the Credit Facility.
We have in place an interest rate swap agreement to manage the risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. We do not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The interest rate swap involves the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. The notional amount of the swap agreement is $60 million, and it will terminate on May 1, 2027. 
As part of our growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and may pursue acquisitions or other strategic relationships in the future that we believe will complement or expand our existing businesses or increase our customer base. We believe we could borrow additional funds under our current or new credit facilities or sell equity for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our existing Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our working capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.

(1)    Represents balance outstanding as of March 30, 2025, and assumes such amount remains outstanding until its maturity date, as periodic payments are not required under the terms of our Credit Agreement. However, it is our intention to pay down our debt with available excess cash flow. See Note 8 to our consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
(2)    Represents interest payments and commitment fees payable on outstanding balances under our revolver, net of the expected receivable from our interest rate swap agreement, and assumes interest rates remain unchanged from the rate as of March 30, 2025.
(3)    As reported under ASC Topic 842.
(4)    This relates to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. Payments on this obligation will continue through 2034.
(5)     Represents the fair value of the earnout liability recorded in conjunction with the Water Solutions acquisition is based upon achieving certain targets payable 3 years after acquisition. 
In addition to the above contractual obligations, in the ordinary course of business we have routine cash requirements related to capital expenditures for new trucks, facility improvements and expansions, safety equipment and other additions of property, plant and equipment. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 were $41.1 million and in fiscal 2024 were $40.2 million. We anticipate total capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million for fiscal 2026.
Critical Accounting Estimates
In preparing the financial statements, we follow U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We have determined the following is a critical accounting estimate material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
Acquisition accounting.
 The fair value of the consideration we pay for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed. The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models. Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for the business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates. See Note 2, Acquisitions included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions.

ITEM 7A.  
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are subject to the risk inherent in the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices. However, we do not currently purchase forward contracts or otherwise engage in hedging activities with respect to the purchase of commodity chemicals. We attempt to pass changes in the cost of our materials on to our customers; however, there are no assurances that we will be able to pass on the increases in the future.
We are exposed to market risks related to interest rates. Our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under our credit facility. A 25-basis point change in interest rates on the variable-rate portion of debt not covered by the interest rate swap would potentially increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $0.2 million. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency risk, do not arise in the normal course of our business activities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Hawkins, Inc.
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Hawkins, Inc. (a Minnesota corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 30, 2025, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2025, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 30, 2025, and our report dated May 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of Amerochem or Waterguard, wholly-owned subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting less than 10 and less than 2 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 30, 2025. As indicated in Management’s Report, Amerochem and Waterguard were acquired during fiscal 2025. Management’s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of Amerochem and Waterguard.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Hawkins, Inc.
Opinion on the financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hawkins, Inc. (a Minnesota corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 30, 2025 and March 31, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 30, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 30, 2025 and March 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2025, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated May 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matters
Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 
/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.

HAWKINS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — 
Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies 
Nature of Business - 
We have 
three
 reportable segments: Water Treatment, Industrial, and Health and Nutrition. The Water Treatment Group specializes in providing chemicals, products, equipment, services and solutions for potable water, municipal and industrial wastewater, industrial process water, non-residential swimming pool water and agricultural water. This group has the resources and flexibility to treat systems ranging in size from a single small well to a multi-million-gallon-per-day facility. The Industrial Group specializes in providing industrial chemicals, products and services to industries such as agriculture, chemical processing, electronics, energy, food, pharmaceutical and plating. This group also manufactures and sells certain food-grade products, including liquid phosphates, lactates and other blended products. Our Health and Nutrition Group specializes in providing ingredient distribution, processing and formulation solutions to manufacturers of nutraceutical, functional food and beverage, personal care, dietary supplement and other nutritional food, health and wellness products. This group offers a diverse product portfolio including minerals, vitamins and amino acids, excipients, joint products, botanicals and herbs, sweeteners and enzymes.
Fiscal Year - 
Our fiscal year is a 52 or 53-week year ending on the Sunday closest to March 31. Our fiscal 2025 was 52 weeks, fiscal 2024 was 52 weeks, and fiscal 2023 was 52 weeks. Fiscal 2026 will be 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation - 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hawkins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
Estimates
 - 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, particularly receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, intangibles, accrued expenses, short-term and long-term lease liabilities, income taxes and related accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition - 
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of the promised products to the customer, with revenue recognized at the point in time the customer obtains control of the products. Net sales include products and shipping charges, net of estimates for product returns and any related sales rebates. We estimate product returns based on historical return rates. Using probability assessments, we estimate sales rebates expected to be paid over the term of the contract. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation and are short term in nature. Sales taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales. We offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives. The discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized in an amount estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations. 
Shipping and Handling - 
All shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are included in revenues. Costs incurred related to the shipping and the handling of products are included in cost of sales.

32
HAWKINS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 — (Continued)
Fair Value Measurements - 
The financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value for each reporting period are an interest rate swap, marketable securities held in a deferred compensation retirement plan, and the earnout liability recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Water Solutions. There are no fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date:
Level 1:
  Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
Level 2:
  Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for the asset or liability.  
Level 3:
  Valuation is based upon unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity. These fair values are determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates or market participant assumptions. 
In making fair value measurements, observable market data must be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Cash Equivalents - 
Cash equivalents include all liquid debt instruments (primarily cash funds and money market accounts) purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The cash balances, maintained at large commercial banking institutions with strong credit ratings, typically exceed federally insured limits.
Trade Receivables and Concentrations of Credit Risk - 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk, principally consist of trade receivables. At the beginning of fiscal 2024, our trade receivables were $129.3 million. We sell our principal products to a large number of customers in many different industries. As of March 30, 2025, we had a significant concentration of credit risk, with a single customer representing approximately 
11
% of our total trade receivables. There are no other concentrations of credit risk with other single customers from a particular service or geographic area that would significantly impact us in the near term. 
To reduce credit risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers. Receivables are reported net of an allowance for credit losses as determined by management at the end of each reporting period. Our receivable allowance is based on an estimate of expected credit losses, with the estimate based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors that, based on collection experience, may have an impact on repayment risk and ability to collect.
Inventories - 
Inventories, consisting primarily of finished goods, are primarily valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost for approximately 
79
% of our inventory determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. Cost for the other 
21
% of our total inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method.
Leases 
- 
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use ("ROU") assets include operating leases. Lease liabilities for operating leases are classified in "short-term lease liabilities" and "long-term lease liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheet.
ROU assets and related liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for separately for real estate leases. For non-real estate leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

Property, Plant and Equipment - 
Property is stated at cost and depreciated or amortized over the lives of the assets, using the straight-line method. Property acquired in a business combination is recorded at the fair value of the assets on the date of acquisition. Estimated lives are generally: 
10
 to 
40
 years for buildings and improvements; 
3
 to 
20
 years for machinery and equipment; and 
3
 to 
10
 years for transportation equipment and office furniture and equipment including computer systems. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Depreciation and amortization expense is recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense, depending on the use of the underlying asset. We recorded depreciation expense of $
27.2
 million for fiscal 2025, $
23.3
 million for fiscal 2024 and $
20.5
 million for fiscal 2023.
Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in income.
We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable, such as prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted) of the related asset group. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset group, an impairment loss would be measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset group. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets. We did not incur any asset write-off charges in fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, or fiscal 2023 related to the impairment of long-lived assets.
Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets - 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual test for impairment is as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter. As of December 30, 2024, we performed an analysis of qualitative factors for our Water Treatment, Industrial, and Health and Nutrition reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of either of these reporting units was less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on management’s analysis of qualitative factors, we determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test for any of these reporting units. Goodwill impairment assessments were also completed in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2023 and, similarly, we did not record a goodwill impairment charge. 
Our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames acquired in previous business acquisitions. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized whereas identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. The values assigned to the intangible assets with finite lives are being amortized on average over a remaining useful life of approximately 
11
 years. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No such events or changes in circumstances occurred during fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. The impairment test consists of a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Based on management’s analysis of qualitative factors, we determined that it was not necessary to perform an annual quantitative impairment test for fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.

Business Combinations - 
We record business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Changes in the estimated fair values of net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will adjust the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are reflected in the period in which they occur.

Income Taxes - 
Deferred taxes are provided for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the value of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We record any interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Stock-Based Compensation - 
We account for stock-based compensation on a fair value basis. The estimated grant date fair value of each stock-based award is recognized in expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). Non-vested share awards are recorded as expense over the requisite service periods based on the stock price on the date of grant.
Earnings Per Share - 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding including the incremental shares assumed to be issued as performance units and restricted stock. 
Basic and diluted EPS were calculated using the following:
March 30, 2025
March 31, 2024
April 2, 2023
Weighted average common shares outstanding — basic
20,803,872

20,864,348

There were 
no
 shares or stock options excluded from the calculation of weighted average common shares for diluted EPS for fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - 
We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt. We have in place an interest rate swap agreement which has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the purpose of which is to eliminate the cash flow impact of interest rate changes on a portion of our variable-rate debt. The interest rate swap is measured at fair value on the contract date and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income, until the consolidated statement of income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in the fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU No.2023-09)
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued accounting standards update No. 2023-09 to enhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures and to provide information to better assess how an entity's operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of ASU No. 2023-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements but will require disclosure at a lower level of detail when adopted in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended March 29, 2026 and in periodic reports thereafter.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU No. 2023-07)
In November 2023, the FASB issued accounting standards update No. 2023-07 to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The update requires public entities to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted this guidance for our annual period ending fiscal 2025. Our adoption of this ASU impacted the level of detail disclosed in our Segment Information footnote and did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

Revenue 
Our revenue arrangements generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods or services. We disaggregate revenues from contracts with customers by both operating segments and types of product sold. Reporting by operating segment is pertinent to understanding our revenues, as it aligns to how we review the financial performance of our operations. Types of products sold within each operating segment help us to further evaluate the financial performance of our segments.

Derivative Instruments 
We have in place an interest rate swap agreement to manage the risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. We do not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The interest rate swap involves the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. The notional amount of the swap agreement is $
60
 million, and it will terminate on May 1, 2027. We have designated this swap as a cash flow hedge and have determined that it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. For so long as the hedge is effective, changes in fair value of the cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss (net of tax) until income or loss from the cash flows of the hedged item is realized. 
For fiscal 2025, we recorded $
1.4
 million in other comprehensive income related to unrealized losses (net of tax) on the cash flow hedge. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded $
0.2
 million and $
1.6
 million, respectively, in other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains (net of tax) on the cash flow hedge. Included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheet was $
2.4
 million as of March 30, 2025 and $
4.3
 million as of March 31, 2024.
By their nature, derivative instruments are subject to market risk. Derivative instruments are also subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparty with a contract in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of the contract. While the current interest rate swap is in effect, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty.

Note 5 – 
Fair Value Measurements 
Our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Because of the variable-rate nature of our debt under our credit facility, our debt also approximates fair value.  
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. 
The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. 

Our financial assets that are re-measured and reported at fair value for each reporting period are an interest rate swap, marketable securities held in a deferred compensation retirement plan, and the earnout liability recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of Water Solutions. The interest rate swap and assets held in a deferred compensation retirement plan are classified as other long-term assets on our balance sheet, with the portion of the deferred compensation retirement plan assets expected to be paid within twelve months classified as current assets. The earnout liability is classified as a long-term liability on our balance sheet. The fair value of the interest rate swap is determined by the respective counterparties based on interest rate changes. Interest rate swaps are valued based on observable interest rate yield curves for similar instruments. The deferred compensation plan assets relate to contributions made to a non-qualified compensation plan on behalf of certain employees who are classified as “highly compensated employees” as determined by IRS guidelines. The assets are part of a rabbi trust and the funds are held in mutual funds. The fair value of the deferred compensation is based on the quoted market prices for the mutual funds at the end of the period. 
The earnout liability recorded in conjunction with the Water Solutions acquisition is based upon achieving certain targets. The earnout is based on a target of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in year three of the acquisition. The earnout liability was valued based upon a risk-neutral pricing analysis within a Monte Carlo simulation framework, which is a Level 3 input. The Monte Carlo simulation assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the earnout included forecasted EBITDA, an estimated EBITDA-specific required rate of return, term period, risk-free rate, and an estimated EBITDA-specific volatility. Other key inputs included an estimate of our credit-adjusted discount rate and an appropriate risk-free rate over the term of the simulation period. The earnout liability is adjusted to fair value at each reporting date until settled. Changes in fair value are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 8 – 
Debt 
As of March 30, 2025, we had in place a second amended and restated credit agreement, as amended (the "Existing Credit Agreement") with U.S. Bank National Association and other lenders which provided us with secured revolving credit facilities (the "Existing Revolving Loan Facility”) totaling $
250
 million. The Existing Revolving Loan Facility included a $
10
 million letter of credit subfacility and a $
25
 million swingline subfacility. The Existing Revolving Loan Facility was scheduled to mature on April 30, 2027. The Existing Revolving Loan Facility was secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and those of our subsidiaries.
At March 30, 2025, the effective interest rate on our borrowings was 
4.3
%. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Revolving Loan Facility, we were required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee was between 
0.15
% and 
0.25
%, depending on our leverage ratio. 
Unamortized debt issuance costs of $
0.3
 million paid in connection with the Existing Credit Facility are reflected as a reduction of debt and are amortized as interest expense over the term of the Existing Revolving Loan Facility.

HAWKINS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 — (Continued)
The Existing Credit Agreement required us to maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 
1.15
 to 
1.00
 and (b) a maximum total cash flow leverage ratio of 
3.0
 to 
1.0
. The Credit Agreement also contained other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restricted our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of significant assets, make certain investments, including any acquisitions other than permitted acquisitions, make certain payments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, grant liens on our assets or enter into rate management transactions, subject to certain limitations. We were permitted to make distributions, pay dividends and repurchase shares so long as no default or event of default existed or would exist as a result thereof. As of March 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all required covenants.

Share-Based Compensation

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.
  Our Board of Directors has approved a performance-based equity compensation arrangement for our executive officers. This performance-based arrangement provides for the grant of performance-based restricted stock units that represent a possible future issuance of restricted shares of our common shares based on our pre-tax income target for the applicable fiscal year. The actual number of restricted shares to be issued to each executive officer will be determined when our final financial information becomes available after the applicable fiscal year and will be between 
zero
 shares and 
76,137
 shares in the aggregate for fiscal 2025. The restricted shares issued, if any, will fully vest two years after the end of the fiscal year on which the performance is based. We record the compensation expense for the outstanding performance share units and then-converted restricted stock over the life of the awards.
The following table represents the restricted stock activity for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025:

3.7
 million for fiscal 2024 and $
2.8
 million for fiscal 2023, substantially all of which was recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total fair value of performance-based restricted stock units vested was $

 million in fiscal 2024 and $
1.9

HAWKINS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 — (Continued)
Until the performance-based restricted stock units result in the issuance of restricted stock, the amount of expense recorded each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued and our then-current common share price. Upon issuance of restricted stock, we record compensation expense over the remaining vesting period using the award date closing price. Unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock and non-vested restricted share units as of March 30, 2025 was $
6.4
 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
1.3
 years.
Restricted Stock Awards.
  As part of their retainer, our directors, other than the Chief Executive Officer, receive restricted stock for their Board services. The restricted stock awards are expensed over a one-year vesting period, based on the market value on the date of grant.

Note 10 — 
Share Repurchases 
Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 
2,600,000
 shares of our outstanding common shares. The shares may be repurchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to applicable securities laws and regulations. Upon repurchase of the shares, we reduce our common shares for the par value of the shares, with the excess applied against additional paid-in capital. We repurchased 
205,943
 common shares at an aggregate purchase price of $
20.7
 million during fiscal 2025. We repurchased 
191,861
 common shares at an aggregate purchase price of $

Note 11 — 
Retirement Plans 
Company Sponsored Plans
.
 The majority of our non-bargaining unit employees are eligible to participate in a company-sponsored profit-sharing plan. Contributions are made at our discretion subject to a maximum amount allowed under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). The profit sharing plan contribution level for each employee depends upon date of hire, and was 
2.5
% or 
5.0
% of each employee’s eligible compensation for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. We also have in place a retirement plan covering our collective bargaining unit employees. The retirement plan provides for a contribution of 
2.5
% or 
5.0
% of each employee’s eligible annual wages depending on their hire date. In addition to the employer contributions described above, both the profit-sharing plan and the retirement plan include a 401(k) plan that allows employees to contribute pre-tax earnings up to the maximum amount allowed under the IRC, with an employer match of up to 
5
% of the employee’s eligible compensation.   
42
HAWKINS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 — (Continued)
We have two employee stock ownership plans (“ESOPs”), one covering the majority of our non-bargaining unit employees and the other covering our collective bargaining unit employees. Contributions to the plan covering our non-bargaining unit employees are made at our discretion. Contributions to both plans are subject to a maximum amount allowed under the IRC, and were 
2.5
% or 
5.0
% of each employee’s eligible wages, depending on each eligible employee’s hire date, for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. 
We have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan covering employees who are classified as “highly compensated employees” as determined by IRS guidelines for the plan year and who were hired on or before April 1, 2012. Employees who are eligible for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan for any plan year are not eligible for the profit-sharing plan contribution or the ESOP contributions described above for that plan year. Our contribution to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was 
10
% of each employee’s eligible compensation, subject to the maximum amount allowed under the IRC.  
We have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) covering substantially all of our employees. The ESPP allows employees to purchase newly-issued shares of the Company’s common shares at a discount from market. The number of new shares issued under the ESPP was 
40,045
 in fiscal 2025, 
61,981
 in fiscal 2024 and 
65,597

In 2013, we withdrew from a collectively bargained multiemployer pension plan and recorded a liability for our share of the unfunded vested benefits. Payments of approximately $
0.5
 million per year are being made through 2034.
Note 12 — 
Commitments and Contingencies 
Litigation.  
As of March 30, 2025, there were no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.  Legal fees associated with such matters are expensed as incurred.

Environmental Remediation. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a liability of $
7.7
 million related to estimated remediation expenses associated with perchlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") discovered in the soil at our Rosemount, MN facility during our expansion project. This expense was recorded as an operating expense within cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We acquired the property, which had prior heavy industrial use, in fiscal 2012. While the source of the PCBs is unknown, we have never brought PCBs onto the property or used PCBs on the site. The liability is not discounted as management expects to incur these expenses within the next twelve months. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient. While additional expense related to the remediation may be incurred in future periods if currently unknown issues arise, we are unable to estimate the extent of any further financial impact.
Asset Retirement Obligations.  
We have 
three
 leases of land that contain terms that state that at the end of the lease term, we have a specified amount of time to remove the property and buildings. Including available lease extensions, these leases expire in 2029, 2033 and 2044. At that time, anything that remains on the land becomes the property of the lessor, and the lessor has the option to either maintain the property or remove the property at our expense. We have not been able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations, primarily due to the combination of the following factors: certain of the leases do not expire in the near future; we have a history of extending the leases with the lessors and currently intend to do so at expiration of the lease periods; the lessors do not have a history of terminating leases with their tenants; and because it is more likely than not that the buildings will have value at the end of the lease life and therefore, may not be removed by either the lessee or the lessor. Therefore, in accordance with accounting guidance related to asset retirement and environmental obligations, we have not recorded an asset retirement obligation as of March 30, 2025. We will continue to monitor the factors surrounding the requirement to record an asset retirement obligation and will recognize the fair value of a liability in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate can be made.

Segment Information
We organize and manage our business by the following 
three
 segments, which meet the definition of reportable segments under ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting: Water Treatment, Industrial and Health and Nutrition. These segments are defined primarily by product and type of customer.
Our chief operating decision-maker (CODM), who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, regularly reviews the consolidated financial statements in their entirety and financial information at the reportable segment level. The CODM uses operating income and considers budget-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. The CODM also uses segment operating income for evaluating pricing strategy, to assess the performance of each segment by comparing the results of each segment with one another, and in determining the compensation of certain employees. The CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions and making resource allocation decisions for the company and the segments.
•
Our Water Treatment segment specializes in providing chemicals, products, equipment, services and solutions for potable water, municipal and industrial wastewater, industrial process water, non-residential swimming pool water and agricultural water. This segment has the resources and flexibility to treat systems ranging in size from a single small well to a multi-million-gallon-per-day facility.
•
Our Industrial segment specializes in providing industrial chemicals, products and services to industries such as agriculture, chemical processing, electronics, energy, food, pharmaceutical and plating. This segment's principal products are acids, alkalis and food-grade and pharmaceutical salts and ingredients.

•
Our Health and Nutrition segment specializes in providing ingredient distribution, processing and formulation solutions to manufacturers of nutraceutical, functional food and beverage, personal care, dietary supplement and other nutritional food, health and wellness products. This segment offers a diverse product portfolio including minerals, vitamins and amino acids, excipients, joint products, botanicals and herbs, sweeteners and enzymes.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Product costs and expenses for each segment are based on actual costs incurred along with cost allocations of shared and centralized functions.
Segments are responsible for the sales, marketing and development of their products and services. Other than our Health and Nutrition segment, the segments do not have separate customer service or purchasing functions. There are 
no
 intersegment sales, and 
no
 operating segments have been aggregated. 
In fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, none of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our total sales.

HAWKINS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 — (Continued)
Note 16 — 
Subsequent Events
On April 25, 2025, we entered into a second amendment that further amended the Existing Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The second amendment increased the revolving commitment under the Existing Credit Agreement to provide us with senior secured revolving credit facilities (the “Revolving Loan Facility”) totaling $
400.0
 million. The Revolving Loan Facility includes a $
10.0
 million letter of credit subfacility and $
25.0
 million swingline subfacility. U.S. Bank, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Associated Bank, N.A. were lenders under the Credit Agreement as of the date of the second amendment.
We drew approximately $
150
 million of the proceeds from the Revolving Loan Facility to acquire substantially all of the assets of WaterSurplus. We may use other proceeds from the Revolving Loan Facility for working capital, capital expenditures, restricted payments and other acquisitions permitted under the Credit Agreement, and other general corporate purposes.
We paid fees of approximately $
1.0
 million associated with this refinancing. The Revolving Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on April 25, 2030.
Also on April 25, 2025, we acquired substantially all of the assets of WaterSurplus for approximately $
150
 million and may be obligated to pay up to an additional $
53.7
 million based on achieving certain earnings targets five years after the closing of the acquisition. WaterSurplus delivers sustainable water treatment solutions throughout the United States focused on membrane separation systems, engineering and design services, media filtration systems, new equipment and rental unit manufacturing and sales, along with rapid-response PFAS removal solutions for “forever chemicals”. WaterSurplus serves municipal water customers as well as customers in the food and beverage industry, offering patented products within its filtration business that reduce the frequency of membrane cleaning, resulting in lower energy costs, downtime, and lower overall operational costs.
In April 2025, we realigned our reporting segments to reflect organizational changes made and to reflect the way we manage our operations and allocate resources. In fiscal 2026, we will have the following reporting segments: Water Treatment, Health and Food Sciences, and Industrial Solutions. We believe this realignment better reflects the value our company provides to our customers and our evolution from a bulk commodity distributor into a specialty ingredients company.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

ITEM 9A.  
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we conducted an evaluation, under supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 30, 2025, based on the criteria described in 
Internal

Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In making this assessment as of March 30, 2025, we have excluded the water treatment operations acquired from Amerochem in January 2025 and Waterguard in October 2024. The financial statements of these businesses comprise less than 10% of total assets and less than 2% of total revenues in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 30, 2025. We have excluded these businesses because we have not had sufficient time to make an assessment of their internal controls using the COSO criteria in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In excluding these businesses from our assessment, we have considered the “Frequently Asked Questions” as set forth by the office of the Chief Accountant and the Division of Corporate Finance on June 24, 2004, as revised on September 24, 2007, which acknowledges that it may not be possible to conduct an assessment of an acquired business’s internal control over financial reporting in the period between the consummation date and the date of management’s assessment and contemplates that such business would be excluded from management’s assessment in the year of acquisition.  Based on this assessment, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 30, 2025.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting for March 30, 2025, which is included in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in Item 8 of this Annual Report on 10-K.  
Changes in Internal Control Procedures
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
