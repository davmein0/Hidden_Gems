ITEM 1. Business
We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called Antibody Oligonucleotide Conjugates, or AOCs™. Our proprietary AOC platform is designed to combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, with the precision of RNA therapeutics to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable with such therapeutics. Our pipeline currently has three programs in potentially registrational clinical trials. Delpacibart etedesiran, abbreviated as del-desiran (formerly AOC 1001), is designed to treat people with myotonic dystrophy type 1, or DM1, and is currently in Phase 3 development with the global HARBOR™ trial. Delpacibart braxlosiran, or del-brax (formerly AOC 1020), is the first investigational therapy designed to directly target DUX4 in people living with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, and is currently in Phase 1/2 development with the FORTITUDE™ trial. Delpacibart zotadirsen, or del-zota (formerly AOC 1044), is designed for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, and is currently in development with the Phase 2 EXPLORE44 Open-Label Extension (OLE) study. Del-zota is specifically designed for people with mutations amenable to exon 44 skipping, or DMD44, and is the first of multiple AOCs we are developing for DMD. Del-desiran, del-brax and del-zota have all been granted Orphan Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and Fast Track designation by the FDA. In addition, the FDA has granted del-desiran Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of DM1 and granted del-zota Rare Pediatric Disease designation.
In February 2025, we announced we will be reporting top-line del-zota data from our completed Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44 trial for people living with DMD44 at the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Clinical and Scientific Conference in March 2025. We also announced we have now completed enrollment in the EXPLORE44-OLE™ study for people living with DMD44. The data from the Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44® and EXPLORE44-OLE studies will support the company’s first BLA submission anticipated at year end 2025.
Additionally, we shared our full year 2024 highlights across our three clinical development programs for del-zota, del-desiran and del-brax, and other pipeline advancements. These include:
Del-zota for DMD44

Our Strategy
Our mission is to profoundly improve people’s lives by revolutionizing the delivery of RNA therapeutics. We are executing on our mission by focusing on our three strategic pillars: a disruptive and broad AOC platform, an advancing and expanding pipeline, and building an agile and diverse company. With this strategy, our goal is 
3
Table of Contents
to discover, develop and commercialize novel AOC therapeutics that overcome current barriers to the delivery of oligonucleotides and unlock their potential to treat a wide range of serious diseases currently lacking adequate treatment options. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:
•
Harness the power of our AOC platform to develop a new class of drugs
; 
•
Continue advancing our three clinical stage product candidates in rare neuromuscular indications;
•
Expand our pipeline in our current focus areas of neuromuscular and precision cardiology indications as well as into additional tissue types; and
•
Build an agile and diverse company.
As we continue to expand the company, we remain focused on employing a disciplined strategy to

maximize the value of our pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those product candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own if they are approved. We continue to collaborate on product candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas or patient populations that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies. Through collaborations and our internal research, we plan to continue to invest our resources in our AOC platform to explore the full potential of our AOCs in additional previously inaccessible tissue and cell types.
Our AOC Product Platform
Overview
We are committed to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called AOCs designed to overcome the current limitations of oligonucleotide therapies in order to treat a wide range of serious diseases. We utilize our proprietary AOC platform to design, engineer and develop therapeutics that combine specificity of mAbs with the precision of oligonucleotide therapies to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable with such therapeutics. All of our oligonucleotides target disease-related RNA. RNA is a polymeric molecule essential in the coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. We have accumulated deep experience regarding oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques. We collectively refer to the know-how and proprietary technology borne out of this experience, and their systematic application in the design and development of our product candidates, as our AOC platform.
Our Approach

Based on the data-driven hypothesis that the delivery of oligonucleotides can be greatly enhanced by using antibodies as conjugates, our scientists have established a framework for screening potential cell surface protein-mAb pairs to determine which pairs we believe are well suited to deliver active oligonucleotides to specific cell types. We have identified multiple cell surface protein-mAb pairs that can deliver oligonucleotides into various tissue and cell types to induce pharmacologic changes. For example, we have employed AOCs built on a scaffold of a mAb or mAb fragment that binds with high selectivity and affinity to TfR1 to deliver oligonucleotides to cell types outside of the liver. 
Our deep experience with oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation, and drug delivery techniques provides the foundation for our efforts to address the current limitations of oligonucleotide therapies. Our disruptive and broad AOC platform also affords us the option to deploy various types of oligonucleotides, including small interfering RNAs, or siRNAs, and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, or PMOs, whose specific mechanisms of action modify RNA function in different ways. We have programs utilizing both siRNAs and PMOs in clinical development. This flexibility allows us to use oligonucleotides that are tailored to modulate a given disease process. Mechanisms of these oligonucleotides can range from reducing the expression of a disease-related RNA with siRNAs, to correction of aberrant processing of RNAs with splice modifying oligonucleotides. AOCs are designed to do the following:
•
Combine the proven technologies of approved mAbs and oligonucleotides;
•
Deliver to tissues previously untreatable with RNA therapeutics, starting with muscle and broadening to other tissues and cell types; and
4
Table of Contents
•
Scale with experienced manufacturers who are able to utilize well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs

and oligonucleotides. We also have the ability to use a single mAb across multiple programs, providing significant leverage around development costs and timelines associated with each incremental program.
Advantages of our AOC Platform
We believe that the product candidates derived from our AOC platform will have the potential to offer the following distinct advantages:
•
Expand scope of diseases addressable with oligonucleotides
: (i) utilize identified cell surface protein-antibody pairs to design

oligonucleotides to precisely target the underlying cause of diseases previously untreatable with RNA therapeutics; (ii) flexibility to deploy an appropriate oligonucleotide type for different diseases; and (iii) optimize all structural components of our AOCs for effective delivery—the oligonucleotide, the mAb and the antibody conjugate design;
•
Potential to mitigate toxicity by limiting drug exposure: 
(i) selection of the most potent oligonucleotide type; (ii) targeted delivery

to tissues and cells; and (iii) infrequent administration;
•
Infrequent dosing: 
(i) ability to deliver oligonucleotides to tissues and cells at concentrations that produce pronounced and

prolonged pharmacodynamic effects as observed in our preclinical models; and (ii) ability to select appropriate oligonucleotide mechanisms to maximize durability; and
•
Readily reproducible and scalable
: (i) AOCs synthesized using well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs

and oligonucleotides; and (ii) ability to use a single mAb across multiple programs provides significant leverage around development costs and timelines associated with each incremental muscle program. For example, we use the same mAb targeting TfR1 across our current muscle franchise.
Data from our three clinical stage programs has demonstrated as of their latest respective data cutoff dates that AOC-derived product candidates can consistently and reproducibly deliver oligonucleotides to muscle and engage the relevant RNA target.
Our Development Programs
We are advancing and expanding our innovative AOC pipeline to develop potential treatment options for patients and their families across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Our first AOC programs are from our rare neuromuscular disease franchise where we have leveraged our deep experience with oligonucleotide therapeutics, modulation of RNA processes, antibody engineering and conjugation and drug delivery techniques. We now have programs in our early-stage development pipeline through internal efforts and external collaborations that explore utilizing AOCs in additional indications including cardiology and immunology. We have now expanded beyond rare neuromuscular disorders and into precision cardiology, advancing two wholly-owned precision cardiology development candidates targeting rare genetic cardiomyopathies for PRKAG2 syndrome and PLN cardiomyopathy.
The research and development chart below represents a summary of our wholly-owned development programs.

Table of Contents
We selected muscle as the first tissue type in which to explore the potential of our AOCs. In our early screening efforts, we observed a 95% reduction of target gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle with the AOC we tested, which in part led us to focus on developing a deep pipeline of AOCs that are designed to address multiple rare neuromuscular diseases including DM1, FSHD and DMD. We currently use the same proprietary mAb targeting TfR1 across our neuromuscular and precision cardiology programs, which we believe gives us significant leverage of development costs and timelines associated with each incremental neuromuscular program.
Our Clinical Programs
Del-desiran for the Treatment of DM1
Del-desiran is designed to address the root cause of DM1 by reducing levels of a disease-related mRNA called DMPK. Del-desiran consists of a proprietary mAb that binds to the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) conjugated with an siRNA targeting DMPK mRNA. Del-desiran is currently being studied in the global Phase 3 HARBOR trial and in the ongoing MARINA-OLE trial in people with DM1. Long-term data from the MARINA-OLE trial showed reversal of disease progression in people living with DM1 across multiple endpoints including video hand opening time (vHOT) as a measure of hand function and myotonia, muscle strength and activities of daily living when compared to END-DM1 natural history data. Del-desiran has received Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations by the FDA and Orphan designation by the European Commission.
DM1 Disease Overview
DM1 is an underrecognized, progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disease with multiple organ involvement. DM1 is a monogenic, autosomal dominant disease caused by a triplet-repeat in the DMPK gene, resulting in a toxic gain of function mRNA. DM1 primarily affects skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle and can be highly variable with respect to severity, presentation and age of onset. Patients can suffer from a constellation of manifestations including myotonia and muscle weakness, respiratory problems, fatigue, hypersomnia, cardiac abnormalities, gastrointestinal complications, and cognitive and behavioral impairment. DM1 is estimated to affect an estimated 80,000 in the United States and Europe. All forms, except the late-onset form, of DM1 are associated with high levels of disease burden and may cause premature mortality.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
There are currently no approved therapies to treat DM1, and medical care is focused largely on symptom management. A previous attempt at treating DM1 with an unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide was discontinued due to challenges associated with delivery. Therefore, there remains a high unmet medical need for new disease modifying therapies.

Table of Contents
Our Solution
Del-desiran consists of a proprietary mAb that binds to TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA, siDMPK.19, targeted to DMPK RNA, and is designed to be administered to the patient as an intravenous infusion. We believe that the following specific characteristics of del-desiran position it to have advantages over historical and current efforts to develop an effective therapy for people with DM1:
•
Addresses the underlying cause of the disease
—DM1 is caused by an increase in the number of CUG triplet repeats occurring in the

DMPK gene product. Del-desiran is designed to reduce the expression levels of DMPK RNA, thereby reducing the CUG burden in the nucleus and thereby releasing muscle blind-like protein to allow for normal mRNA processing;
•
Efficient delivery of drug substance to diseased cells
—In an effort to solve for challenges identified in prior unsuccessful efforts to

deliver an unconjugated oligonucleotide into muscle cells, the TfR1 antibody component of del-desiran facilitates efficient delivery of del-desiran to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Once inside the muscle cells, the siRNA component of del-desiran, siDMPK.19, acts to reduce levels of DMPK mRNA in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm;
•
Reproducible and scalable therapeutic
—As with all our AOCs, del-desiran is readily synthesized using well-established and scalable

methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides.
Phase 3 HARBOR Study
In June 2024, we announced the initiation of our global Phase 3 HARBOR trial and began administration of del-desiran. We anticipate completion of enrollment of the ongoing Phase 3 HARBOR trial in mid-2025. The HARBOR trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pivotal study designed to evaluate del-desiran in approximately 150 people (age 16 and older) living with DM1. The trial will be conducted at approximately 40 sites globally. Patients will be administered either del-desiran or placebo (1:1) every eight weeks. The trial is designed to assess del-desiran’s impact on multiple key aspects of DM1 including myotonia, muscle strength and activities of daily living. All study participants, regardless of whether they receive active treatment or placebo, will have the option to enroll into an open-label extension trial.
Phase 1/2 MARINA Clinical Trial and MARINA-OLE Study
The MARINA trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 clinical trial that enrolled 38 adults with DM1. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of del-desiran

administered intravenously. The MARINA trial assessed the activity of del-desiran across key biomarkers, including spliceopathy, an important biomarker for DM1, and knockdown of DMPK mRNA. Though the Phase 1/2 trial was not powered to assess functional benefit, it explored the clinical activity of del-desiran

in multiple measures of muscle function including myotonia, muscle strength, measures of mobility as well as patient reported outcomes and quality of life measures. Patients had the option to enroll in MARINA-OLE, an open label extension study, at the end of the treatment period. MARINA-OLE is an open-label, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of del-desiran in participants with DM1 who were previously enrolled in the MARINA Phase 1/2 trial. This trial continues to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of del-desiran in participants enrolled in the randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 MARINA clinical trial. All participants who completed the MARINA study rolled-over into the MARINA-OLE study and continue to receive del-desiran regardless of whether they received treatment or placebo in the MARINA study.

Table of Contents
The sites participating in the MARINA-OLE study are all part of the Myotonic Dystrophy Clinical Research Network, or DMCRN. The DMCRN is running a natural history study called Establishing Biomarkers and Clinical Endpoints in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1, or END-DM1. We have entered into an agreement supporting END-DM1, a non-interventional study designed to advance the understanding of disease progression in approximately 700 people with DM1. This agreement allows us to assess the data from END-DM1, which we believe continues to support the clinical development of del-desiran.
Long-Term Del-desiran Data Reported in March 2024 from the Phase 2 MARINA-OLE Trial
Del-desiran data reported in March 2024 showed reversal of disease progression in people living with DM1 across multiple endpoints including video hand opening time, or vHOT, muscle strength and activities of daily living when compared to END-DM1 natural history data.

This del-desiran 4 mg/kg data from the MARINE-OLE study showed consistent and durable improvements in the following:
•
Myotonia (vHOT)
•
Multiple measures of strength:
•
Hand grip
•
Quantitative Muscle Testing (QMT) total score which includes hand grip; elbow extension and elbow flexion; knee extension and knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion
•
DM1-Activ, a patient reported outcome (PRO) that measures activities of daily living (e.g., taking a shower, visiting family or friends, and walking up stairs)
With over 265 infusions totaling 61.1 patient-years of exposure, del-desiran continued to demonstrate favorable safety and tolerability. Additionally:
•
All related adverse events (AE) were mild or moderate;
•
The most common related AEs reported in 2 or more participants in the MARINA-OLE were nausea and headache;
•
There were no study drug related SAEs; and
•
There have been no discontinuations in the MARINA-OLE study.
In January 2025, we announced that we will be presenting an update from the ongoing MARINE-OLE trial including long-term 4mg/kg and safety data in the fourth quarter of 2025. We anticipate providing publication of data analyses from the completed Phase 1/2 MARINA trial in 2025. We anticipate submitting marketing applications in 2026, including in the U.S. and European Union.

Table of Contents
In October 2024, the FDA removed the partial clinical hold placed on del-desiran in September 2022, in response to a serious adverse event, or SAE, reported in a single participant in the 4mg/kg cohort of the MARINA study.
Del-brax for the Treatment of FSHD
We are developing del-brax to treat the underlying cause of FSHD, one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy. FSHD is a genetic muscle disorder in which the muscles of the face, shoulder blades, and upper arms are among the most affected. Symptoms usually begin before age 20, with weakness and atrophy of the muscles around the eyes and mouth, shoulders, abdominal muscles, upper arms, and lower legs, usually with asymmetric involvement. FSHD is caused by the aberrant expression, and subsequent translation, of a gene called double homeobox 4, or DUX4, which leads to cell death, immune response and oxidative stress.
Our therapeutic strategy in FSHD employs an AOC based on our proprietary mAb that targets TfR1 to deliver an siRNA targeted to DUX4 mRNA. By directly targeting DUX4 RNA in the muscle, leading to destruction of the DUX4 transcripts, we can reduce the downstream effects including cell death and oxidative stress. There are no currently approved treatments for people living with FSHD and a significant unmet need remains. The FDA and European Commission have granted Orphan Designation for del-brax. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to del-brax for the treatment of FSHD.
Disease Overview
FSHD is characterized by progressive and often asymmetric skeletal muscle loss that initially causes weakness in muscles in the face, shoulders, arms and trunk and progresses to weakness in muscles in lower body. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease caused by the aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene in the skeletal muscle, which activates genes that are toxic to muscle cells and leads to a series of downstream events that result in skeletal muscle wasting and compromised muscle function. Skeletal muscle weakness results in physical limitations throughout the whole body, including an inability to lift arms for more than a few seconds, loss of ability to show facial expressions and serious speech impediments. These symptoms cause many people affected by FSHD to become dependent on the use of a wheelchair for mobility. FSHD affects both sexes equally, with onset typically in teenage and young adult years. The FSHD Society estimated FSHD affects approximately one in 20,000 people in the United States. A recent study conducted in the Netherlands reported a more frequent prevalence of one in 8,333 people. We estimate that the FSHD patient population is between 45,000–87,000 in the United States and Europe. As is typical in diseases with no approved therapies, we believe that these patient population estimates are conservative.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
Currently there is no treatment for FSHD, and there are no therapies to treat the underlying cause of FSHD. Current approaches are focused on support for activities of daily living and mobility, improved functioning and lowering the risk of complications. They include physical therapy, exercise, pain management and orthopedic interventions.
Our Solution
Del-brax consists of our proprietary mAb that is designed to bind to TfR1 conjugated with an siRNA targeted to DUX4 mRNA to be administered as an intravenous infusion. We believe that data shown with del-brax to date supports our belief that infrequent administration of del-brax can target the root cause of FSHD in relevant muscle tissues.
We believe that the following specific characteristics of del-brax position it to have advantages over historical and current efforts to develop an effective therapy for people with FSHD:
▪
Addresses the underlying cause of the disease
—del-brax is designed to reduce the expression of the DUX4

mRNA, thereby reducing the expression of the DUX4 protein resulting in reduced expression of the downstream genes that are believed to cause FSHD. We believe these downstream genes can be used as biomarkers to assess the disease state and therapeutic activity.
▪
Efficient delivery of drug substance to diseased cells
— The TfR1 antibody component of the AOC is designed to facilitate efficient delivery to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, an advantage over other companies' previous unsuccessful efforts to

deliver an unconjugated oligonucleotide into muscle cells. 
9
Table of Contents
Once inside the muscle cells, the siRNA component of del-brax, siDUX4, acts to reduce levels of DUX4 mRNA.
▪
Reproducible and scalable therapeutic
—As with all our AOCs, del-brax is readily synthesized using well-established and scalable methods for manufacturing mAbs and oligonucleotides.
Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE Clinical Trial
Del-brax is currently being studied in the Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE trial in adult and adolescent participants with FSHD. The FORTITUDE trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial designed to evaluate single and multiple doses of del-brax

in approximately 100 participants with FSHD. The study is ongoing with dose escalation cohorts A and B fully enrolled and the biomarker cohort currently enrolling participants. The FORTITUDE study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of del-brax

administered intravenously. Activity of del-brax

will be assessed using key biomarkers, including DUX4-regulated muscle and circulating biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of muscle volume and composition. Though the Phase 1/2 trial is not statistically powered to assess functional benefit, it will explore the clinical activity of del-brax including measures of mobility and muscle strength as well as patient reported outcomes and quality of life measures. Participants will have the option to enroll in FORTITUDE-OLE™, an open-label extension study, once their participation in the FORTITUDE study is complete. As of January 2025, all 39 patients enrolled in FORTITUDE cohorts A and B to date remain enrolled in FORTITUDE or FORTITUDE-OLE.
In October 2024, we announced the initiation of the biomarker cohort in the FORTITUDE trial. The biomarker cohort will assess the impact of del-brax

2 mg/kg every six weeks in people living with FSHD, ages 16-70. The primary endpoints of the study are changes in DUX4 regulated gene expression and DUX4 regulated circulating biomarker. Enrollment is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025. In addition, enrollment of the FORTITUDE-OLE is ongoing.
The majority of sites participating in the FORTITUDE trial are part of the FSHD clinical trial research network, or FSHD CTRN. We are partnering with the FSHD CTRN on the ongoing natural history study called Motor Outcomes to Validate Evaluations in FSHD or MOVE FSHD. We are sponsoring the MOVE Plus, or MOVE+, sub-study which is enrolling approximately 100 participants in the US. The goal of MOVE+ is to enhance the community's understanding of how to utilize whole-body MRI and other tools to identify specific biomarkers for FSHD that can accelerate and support future clinical trial design.

Table of Contents
In June 2024, we reported positive initial 2 mg/kg del-brax data from the Phase 1/2 FORTITUDE trial which demonstrated remarkable and consistent reductions of greater than 50% in DUX4 regulated genes, trends of functional improvement, and favorable safety and tolerability in people living with FSHD.
Additionally, this data demonstrated:
▪
Greater than 50% mean reductions in DUX4 regulated genes across multiple panels for DUX4 regulated gene expression in muscle.
▪
All participants treated with del-brax showed reductions greater than 20% in DUX4 regulated genes.
▪
Mean reductions of 25% or greater in novel circulating biomarker and creatine kinase.
▪
Trends of functional improvements including increased strength in upper and lower limb muscles, and muscle function as measured by reachable workspace (RWS) compared to placebo and the ReSolve natural history study.
▪
Trends of improvement in patient and clinician reported outcomes.
▪
Favorable safety and tolerability with all adverse events (AEs) mild or moderate, no serious adverse events and no discontinuations.
In January 2025 we announced that we anticipate reaching regulatory alignment on a global Phase 3 trial design and alignment on a potential accelerated approval path for the ongoing FORTITUDE biomarker cohort in the second quarter of 2025. In addition, we announced that the presentation of topline data from the FORTITUDE trial and initiation of a global, potentially registrational trial in FSHD are also anticipated in the second quarter of 2025.
Del-zota for the Treatment of DMD44
Del-zota is currently being studied for the treatment of people living with DMD44 and is the first of multiple AOCs we are developing for DMD. Del-zota is designed to deliver PMO to skeletal muscle and heart tissue to specifically skip exon 44 of dystrophin mRNA to enable production of near full-length dystrophin. Del-zota is currently in Phase 2 development as part of the EXPLORE44-OLE study in people living with DMD44. The FDA and European Commission granted Orphan designation for del-zota. The FDA has granted del-zota Rare Pediatric Disease designation and Fast Track designation.
Disease Overview
The dystrophin protein maintains the integrity of muscle fibers and acts as a shock absorber through its role as the foundation of a group of proteins that connects the inner and outer elements of muscle cells. DMD causes a lack of functional dystrophin that leads to stress and tears of muscle cell membranes, resulting in muscle cell death and the progressive loss of muscle function. People living with DMD suffer from progressive muscle weakness that typically starts at a very young age. Over time, people with DMD will develop problems walking and breathing, and eventually, the heart and respiratory muscles will stop working. Creatine kinase, or CK, levels are often used as a serum measure of acute muscle damage and tracked in DMD patients over time to assess the potential benefit of treatments in development. Those living with the condition often require special aid and assistance throughout their lives and have significantly shortened life expectancy. While there are treatments approved to treat people with DMD, there remains a very high unmet need. DMD is a 
11
Table of Contents
monogenic, X-linked, recessive disease that primarily affects males, with one in 3,500 to 5,000 boys born worldwide having DMD.
Our Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Programs
We are developing AOCs to treat the underlying cause of DMD and restore dystrophin levels. The oligonucleotides in our AOCs are designed to promote the skipping of specific exons to allow the production of near full-length dystrophin protein. Our most advanced DMD program, del-zota, is designed to treat people with mutations amenable to Exon 44 skipping (DMD44). Del-zota is in clinical development in the Phase 2 EXPLORE44-OLE study. Additionally, our ongoing preclinical development programs target additional mutations that are amenable to exon-skipping, including Exon 45.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations
Currently people with DMD are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component of the disease. There is currently one approved gene therapy for certain DMD patients. Additionally, there are currently three approved unconjugated PMO-based oligonucleotide therapies, each addressing a specific mutation. These drugs require weekly intravenous infusions and have demonstrated mean increases in dystrophin of 1 to 6% in clinical trials. The FDA-approved labels for these drugs state that a clinical benefit has not yet been established and continued approval may be contingent upon the verification of such clinical benefit in confirmatory clinical trials. Additional approaches currently in clinical development include peptide-conjugated PMOs, or PPMOs, and other gene therapies. While there are therapies approved and multiple programs in clinical development for other exons, there are no exon-skipping therapies approved targeting Exon 44.
Our Solution
Our development efforts in DMD are focused on AOCs based on PMOs that can induce exon skipping for Exon 44 and additional exons, including Exon 45, conjugated to our proprietary mAb targeting TfR1. Del-zota is our lead program in development for DMD and targets Exon 44. Exon skipping produces a near full-length dystrophin protein which is believed to have better functional benefit than the significantly shorter version of dystrophin delivered via gene therapy. We believe that our AOCs have the potential to increase the production of dystrophin in people with DMD for two reasons. First, based on recent advances in the understanding of the splicing process and placement of skipping agents on pre-mRNA described in published literature, we have screened for and identified PMOs with optimized skipping activity. Second, the mAb targeting TfR1 allows for more efficient delivery to muscle cells, therefore allowing for better uptake of the PMO. In preclinical studies, we also observed that our TfR1-based AOCs induced exon skipping in cardiac muscle, which we believe may address some of the cardiomyopathies in people with DMD, a key complication of the disease. Based on their mechanism of action, we believe that our AOCs could have utility in several additional DMD mutations.
Phase 1/2 EXPLORE44 Clinical Trial and EXPLORE44-OLE Study
In August 2024, we reported initial data from the 5 mg/kg cohort of our EXPLORE44 trial in people living with DMD44. These data demonstrated consistent delivery of PMO in skeletal muscle, an increase in the mean dystrophin production of 25% of normal and a mean increase of 37% in exon 44 skipping. In addition, del-zota showed greater than 80% reduction of creatine kinase compared to baseline in people living with DMD44. Additional data presented in early 2025 from the EXPLORE44 and EXPLORE44-OLE™ studies demonstrated significant and sustained reductions in CK in the 5 mg/kg cohort. Placebo-treated patients who continued into the EXPLORE44-OLE study showed a rapid decrease in CK after beginning treatment with del-zota.
The initial assessment from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXPLORE44 trial assessed the safety and tolerability for 26 participants across two dose levels (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg). Del-zota demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability, with most treatment emergent AEs mild or moderate in participants with DMD44. Two participants discontinued from the study due to treatment emergent adverse events: one due to a serious adverse event of anaphylaxis which fully resolved, and one due to moderate infusion related reaction. For the 5 mg/kg cohort, participants received three doses of 5 mg/kg of del-zota, or placebo, every six weeks.
Enrollment is now complete for the EXPLORE44 study. Participants in the EXPLORE44 trial had the option to enroll in the EXPLORE44-OLE for del-zota. In addition, we announced we were enrolling additional participants in the EXPLORE44-OLE study to support a BLA submission anticipated at year-end 2025.

Enrollment in the EXPLORE44-OLE study is now complete. We also announced plans to advance additional exon-skipping candidates from our DMD franchise. Exon 45 is currently in IND-enabling studies for the treatment of people living with DMD mutations amendable to exon 45 skipping (DMD45).
In January 2025, we announced that the FDA confirmed an accelerated approval path is available for del-zota and the clinical data package from the EXPLORE44 program could support a BLA filing. Avidity is now planning a potential BLA submission anticipated at year-end 2025. We also announced that we will be presenting topline data from the EXPLORE44 trial in the first quarter of 2025, and topline data from the ongoing EXPLORE44-OLE study in the fourth quarter of 2025.
Our Discovery Programs
Opportunities in Additional Neuromuscular Diseases, Cardiology and Immunology 
We are committed to the advancement and expansion of our pipeline with multiple research and development candidates to treat conditions in skeletal muscle, cardiology and immunology as part of our internal discovery efforts and our collaborations with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS. In November 2024, we announced we had expanded beyond rare neuromuscular disorders and opened up a new therapeutic field, precision cardiology, to address the root cause of genetic diseases of the heart. We are advancing our first two wholly-owned precision cardiology development candidates targeting rare genetic cardiomyopathies: AOC 1086 targeting PLN (phospholamban) cardiomyopathy and AOC 1072 targeting PRKAG2 (Protein Kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit Gamma 2) syndrome. All of the preclinical programs have been engineered using our AOC platform technology. 
We are collaborating with Lilly for the discovery, development and commercialization of AOCs directed to up to six selected mRNA targets in immunology and other select indications outside of muscle. Through our research collaboration with BMS and our internal discovery efforts, our development activities target multiple cardiac-specific indications.
We have multiple early stage research programs ongoing that look at other indications as well as new receptor and antibody pairs to target additional diseases, tissues and cell types with AOCs.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the antibodies, oligonucleotides and linkers used to make our AOCs, and we expect to continue to do so to meet our preclinical, clinical and commercial activities. Our third-party manufacturers are required to manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and other applicable laws and regulations. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates to supply our clinical trials and anticipated commercial requirements. 
Competition

The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
13
Table of Contents
companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
There are currently no approved therapies to treat the underlying cause of DM1. Products currently in development to treat DM1 include: tideglusib, a GSK3-ß inhibitor in late-stage clinical development by AMO Pharma, Ltd. for the congenital phenotype of DM1; DYNE-101, an antibody fragment, or Fab, linked antisense- oligonucleotide (ASO) that is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Dyne Therapeutics, Inc.; PGN-EDODM1, a peptide conjugated ASO by PepGen Inc. being evaluated in a Phase 2 trial expected to initiate by in 2025; VX-670, an EEV-conjugated PMO developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. being evaluated outside the US in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial; and gene editing and RNA targeting small molecule treatments in preclinical development by various companies. There is a growing number of companies in preclinical development pursuing different paths to treat DM1 and we expect that the space will continue to evolve as additional investigational therapies advance.
There are currently no approved therapies to treat the underlying cause of FSHD. Products currently in development to treat FSHD include: RO7204239, a monoclonal antibody against latent myostatin, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG; ARO-DUX4, an investigational RNAi therapeutic by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals which was out-licensed in November 2024 to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., is currently being evaluated outside the U.S. in a Phase 1/2a trial. There is a growing number of companies in preclinical development pursuing different paths to treat FSHD, including, Dyne Therapeutics, Inc., miRecule, Inc./Sanofi S.A., Kate Therapeutics Inc./Novartis, Armatus Bio, Inc./Solid Biosciences Inc., and Celularity Inc. We expect that the space will continue to evolve as additional investigational therapies advance.
Currently, people with DMD are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component of the disease. Deflazacort is an FDA approved corticosteroid marketed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. Agamree is another approved corticosteroid marketed by Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Duvyzat is an HDAC inhibitor from Italfarmaco S.p.A. Additionally, there are three FDA approved exon skipping drugs utilizing unconjugated PMOs marketed by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.: EXONDYS 51 (Eteplirsen) for people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 51; VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) for people with DMD amenable to Exon 53 skipping; and AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) for people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 45. There is an FDA approved exon skipping drug marketed by Nippon Shinyaku Co., Inc.: VILTEPSO (viltolarsen), an unconjugated PMO approved for people with DMD amenable to Exon 53 skipping. We are developing treatments for DMD that target dystrophin mechanisms. Other companies pursuing a similar mechanism include Dyne Therapeutics with DYNE-251, a PMO conjugated to a Fab currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients amendable to Exon 51 skipping; Wave Life Sciences, Ltd. with WVE-N531, an unconjugated PN-modified exon-skipping oligonucleotide currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients amenable to Exon 53 skipping; PepGen with PGN-EDO51, a peptide-conjugated oligonucleotide for patients amenable to Exon 51 skipping being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial; and PTC Therapeutics with ataluren, a small molecule targeting nonsense mutations in a Phase 3 clinical trial. While there are multiple programs in development for people with DMD amenable to skipping Exon 51 or 53, there are very few targeting Exon 44. NS Pharma, Inc. is running a Phase 2 trial with NS-089/NCNP-02 in people amenable to Exon 44 skipping in the US. In December 2022, Entrada’s program ENTR-601-44 was placed on a clinical hold prior to initiating Phase 1 development but has been evaluated in a Phase 1 study outside of the U.S. Companies are also approaching DMD with viral-vector based gene therapy programs that are a one-time treatment versus oligonucleotide-based exon skipping chronic treatments. There is one approved gene therapy for the delivery of microdystrophin mRNA, marketed as ELEVIDYS by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., fully approved for ambulatory DMD patients above the age of three and has received accelerated approval for non-ambulatory DMD patients above the age of three. Several other companies are developing microdystrophin-based gene therapies, including REGENEXBIO Inc. (RGX-202), Solid Biosciences Inc. (SGT-003), and Genethon (GNT-004). We are also aware of several companies targeting non-dystrophin mechanisms for the treatment of DMD. There is a growing number of companies in pursuing different paths to treat DMD, including Capricor Therapeutics, Inc., and we expect that the space will continue to evolve as additional candidates advance.
We will also compete more generally with other companies developing alternative scientific and technological approaches, including other companies working to develop conjugates with oligonucleotides for extra-hepatic delivery, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aro Biotherapeutics Company, Dyne Therapeutics, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, PepGen, PeptiDream Inc. and Bicycle Therapeutics plc, as well as gene therapy and CRISPR approaches.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, which could render our product candidates, if approved, obsolete or non-competitive. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products, if any. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, level of promotional activity, intellectual property protection and availability of reimbursement.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect our product candidates and our AOC product platform through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our AOC product platform, our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how that may be important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions to expand our intellectual property portfolio.
We believe that we have a significant global intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to our AOC product candidates and our technology platform. As of December 31, 2024, the intellectual property portfolio consisted of 40 issued U.S. patents and 30 pending U.S. patent applications that we own or co-own. Collectively, these patent rights relate to various aspects of our AOC product candidates and technology platform. In addition, we have an exclusive license to certain patent rights from the University of Alberta and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in additional countries and jurisdictions where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, New Zealand, Taiwan, and South Korea. We also file patent applications pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. Our PCT patent applications are in the first phase of the PCT process, which is the international phase, in which patent protection is pending under a single patent application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, as a contracting state of the PCT. These PCT patent applications have not yet entered the second phase of the PCT process, which is the national and regional phase, in which rights are continued by filing necessary documents with the patent offices of separate contracting states of the PCT. The national phase of the PCT patent application process occurs 30 months after the earliest priority date of the PCT patent application.
We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new product candidates and platform technologies. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications in any appropriate fields if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop.
We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.

Any patents issued from these applications are expected to expire in 2044; however, a patent term extension may be available.
Intellectual Property Relating to Our AOC Product Platform
As of December 31, 2024, we owned 29 families of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications generally covering our AOC product platform. These families include 37 issued U.S. patents, 26 granted foreign patents, 30 pending U.S. patent applications, 4 pending PCT patent applications and 133 pending foreign patent applications in Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, New Zealand, and Taiwan, relating to key aspects and components of our AOC product platform systems. Our patent applications contain claims covering (i) proprietary antibodies; (ii) proprietary oligonucleotide chemical structures; (iii) proprietary oligonucleotide sequences; (iv) proprietary AOC structures; and (v) methods for manufacturing and using our AOC technologies. Some of these AOC platform cases

Table of Contents
generically cover our various product candidates. The issued U.S. patents and any U.S. patents issuing from our pending U.S. patent applications are expected to expire between 2037 and 2045. We have one patent family licensed from the University of Alberta, which includes 2 issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, 4 granted foreign patents, and six pending applications in Europe, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. We also have one patent family licensed from GenAhead Bio Inc, which includes 2 pending U.S. applications, 4 granted foreign patents, and 3 pending applications in Europe, China, and Japan.
The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the USPTO. For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2037 to 2045, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both.
However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oligonucleotide therapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our AOC product platform and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our AOC product platform and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our AOC product platform and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.
We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in relation to the resulting know-how or inventions. For more information, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Research Collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb
In November 2023, we entered into (i) a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with BMS, or the BMS Collaboration Agreement, to expand on the research with MyoKardia for up to five targets utilizing our proprietary AOC platform technology and (ii) a Securities Purchase Agreement with BMS, or the BMS Purchase Agreement, for the purchase by BMS in a private placement of 5,075,304 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $7.8813 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40 million. We refer to the BMS Collaboration Agreement and the BMS Purchase Agreement together as the "BMS Agreements." Under the terms of the BMS Agreements, we received approximately $100 million upfront, which includes a $60 million cash payment under the terms of the BMS Collaboration Agreement, and approximately $40 million for the purchase of our common stock under the terms of the BMS Purchase Agreement. We are also eligible to receive up to approximately $1.35 billion in research and development milestone payments, up to approximately $825 million in commercial milestone payments, and tiered royalties from high single digits to low double-digits on net sales. We are responsible for our own research collaboration costs incurred under the agreement, subject to a cumulative spending limit of $40 million. BMS will fund all future clinical development, regulatory and commercialization activities coming from this collaboration.
Research Collaboration with Lilly 
In April 2019, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, with Lilly for the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate products, or Products, in immunology and other select indications on a worldwide basis. Under the Lilly Agreement, the parties will collaborate on preclinical research and discovery activities for Products and Lilly will be responsible for funding the cost of preclinical research and discovery activities of both parties for all Products. Lilly will lead the clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of all Products, at Lilly’s sole cost. 
Under the Lilly Agreement, we granted Lilly an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under our technology to research, develop, manufacture, and sell Products directed to up to six mRNA targets. Lilly has the right to sublicense its rights under the Lilly Agreement subject to certain conditions. Lilly granted us a non-exclusive license under certain Lilly technology solely to conduct research under the Lilly Agreement. We retain 
18
Table of Contents
the right to use our technology to perform our obligations under the Lilly Agreement and for all purposes not granted to Lilly. We agreed that we will not, ourselves or with a third party, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize or otherwise exploit any compound or product directed against targets subject to the collaboration. 
Lilly paid us an upfront license fee of $20.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments, up to $140.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $205.0 million in commercialization milestone payments per target. In addition, Lilly is obligated to pay us a tiered royalty ranging from the mid-single to low-double digits on worldwide annual net sales of licensed Products, subject to specified and capped reductions for the market entry of biosimilar products, loss of patent coverage of licensed Products and for payments owed to third parties for additional rights necessary to commercialize licensed Products in the territory. Lilly’s royalty obligations and the Lilly Agreement will expire on a licensed Product-by-licensed Product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the date of the first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed Product in such country. 
Concurrently with the Lilly Agreement, we issued a convertible promissory note to Lilly, or the Lilly Note, and received cash proceeds of $15.0 million. The Lilly Note accrued simple interest of 8.0% per annum and converted into shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock in November 2019.
Research Collaboration with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMS 
In December 2020, we entered into a research collaboration, or the MyoKardia Agreement, with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMS, to demonstrate the potential utility of AOCs in cardiac tissue by leveraging MyoKardia’s genetic cardiomyopathy platform including, among other aspects, its novel target discovery engine and proprietary cardiac disease models. Under the terms of the MyoKardia Agreement, in July 2023, BMS as the successor in interest to MyoKardia, exercised its option to negotiate and enter into a license agreement covering AOCs that modulate the function of cardiovascular targets. The research collaboration with MyoKardia was terminated in November 2023 upon execution of the BMS Collaboration Agreement.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•
completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with GLP regulations and other applicable regulations; 
•
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
•
approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
•
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended use; 
•
submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal trials; 
•
satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
•
a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
19
Table of Contents
•
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and potential inspection of selected clinical investigation sites and/or the trial sponsor to assess compliance with GCP; and 
•
FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, in an effort to support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for certain studies. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, the trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for allowance from the FDA to introduce an investigational drug into interstate commerce and administer the product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and PD characteristics of the product candidate, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the product candidate. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted or modified to allow such continuation. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP regulations, which, among other things, include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND as well as any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or 
in vitro
 testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
Furthermore, an independent IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
•
Phase 1
: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
20
Table of Contents
•
Phase 2
: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 trials.
•
Phase 3
: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and biological characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved.
BLA Review and Approval Process 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, including from preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended for a three-month period by the FDA in response to new data or other information designated as a major amendment to the application. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. 
The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within 
21
Table of Contents
required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites as well as the trial sponsor to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, including additional clinical trials, or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct so-called Phase 4 clinical testing to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval, and may require additional testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original BLAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to expedite FDA’s review and approval of biological products that meet certain criteria. The FDA has a Fast Track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that meet certain criteria. For example, product candidates are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well 
22
Table of Contents
as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of FDA senior managers.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for the product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
Additionally, depending on the design of the applicable clinical trials, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, and may require that such studies be underway before granting any accelerated approval. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval on an expedited basis if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory trial in a timely manner or if such confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. 
Fast Track designation, priority review and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers
In 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the United States within one year following the date of approval.
For purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; and (b) rare diseases or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. Congress has only authorized the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program until December 20, 2024. Consequently, sponsors of marketing applications approved after that date will not receive the voucher unless Congress reauthorizes the program. If the program is not reauthorized, if a drug candidate receives Rare Pediatric Disease designation before December 20, 2024, the sponsor of the marketing application for such drug will only be eligible to receive a voucher if the application for the designated drug is approved by the FDA before October 1, 2026.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and 
23
Table of Contents
promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
•
fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
•
clinical holds on clinical studies; 
•
refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
•
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
•
consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
•
mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
•
the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
•
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
24
Table of Contents
If a product that has Orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities of the Orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
A designated Orphan drug may not receive Orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the disease or condition for which it received Orphan designation. In addition, Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with Orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Biosimilars and reference product exclusivity
The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. 
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of existing exclusivity protection or patent terms, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements 
In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, and physician and other healthcare provider payment transparency laws. In addition to the federal laws summarized below, we may also be subject to similar state and local laws and regulations that may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash 
25
Table of Contents
or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made during the previous year to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care providers including, among others, physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held during the previous year by physicians as defined under statute and their immediate family members. 
Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
Violation of any of such laws or any other applicable governmental regulations may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Health Administration, as well as managed 
26
Table of Contents
care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. 
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebates required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
U.S. Healthcare Reform 
In the United States, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. 
Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. ACA provisions of importance to our product candidates established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; expanded the entities eligible for enrollment in the 340B program; increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in force in its current form.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, on March 
27
Table of Contents
11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, as of January 1, 2024. The rebate was previously capped at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. 
Most significantly, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law. This statute marks the most significant action by Congress with respect to the pharmaceutical industry since adoption of the ACA in 2010. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare, with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); redesigns the Medicare Part D benefit (beginning in 2024); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discount program (beginning in 2025). CMS has published the negotiated prices for the initial ten drugs, which will first be effective in 2026, and has published the list of the subsequent 15 drugs that will be subject to negotiation. The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. While the impact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined, it is likely to be significant.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Some states have also enacted legislation creating so-called prescription drug affordability boards, which ultimately may attempt to impose price limits on certain drugs in these states. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
Foreign Regulation 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, or MA, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, or EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Non-clinical Studies and Clinical Trials
Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. 
Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical (pharmaco-toxicological) studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC (unless otherwise justified for certain particular medicinal products, e.g., radio-pharmaceutical precursors for radio-labeling purposes). In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria 
28

for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements. 
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
While the EU Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state in which the clinical trial takes place, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application for multi-center trials. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
The CTR transition period ended on January 31, 2025, and all clinical trials (and related applications) are now fully subject to the provisions of the CTR.
Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
Marketing Authorization
To market a medicinal product in the EU, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EU, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a MA. To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a MA application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs: 
•
"Centralized MAs" are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as (i) biotechnology medicinal products, (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products, and (iv) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and 
•
"National MAs" are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for product candidates not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent 
29
Table of Contents
authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops.
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
Data and Marketing Exclusivity 
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon MA. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU's regulatory authorities to be a new chemical or biological entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
Orphan Medicinal Products
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product can be designated as an orphan if its sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition (2) either (a) such condition affects not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from the orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized for marketing in the EU or, if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an MAA. An EU orphan designation entitles a party to incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure. Upon grant of a MA, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication, which means that the competent authorities cannot accept another MAA, or grant a MA, or accept an application to extend a MA for a similar medicinal product for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, or PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
The orphan exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for which it received orphan designation, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Additionally, MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although 
30
Table of Contents
similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
Pediatric Development
In the EU, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include sponsor plans for the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. 
Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties. 
Data Privacy and Security Laws 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including the protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CCPA, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Data privacy and security laws, regulations, and related obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing, any of which could cause a significant disruption to our business.
Human Capital
As o
f 
February 14, 2025, we had 391 full-time employees, 90 of whom have a Ph.D. or M.D. degree. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our management team and our employees and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to align our interests and the interests of our stockholders with those of our employees and consultants.
