ITEM 2.    Properties
We currently lease approximately 54,597 square feet of office and laboratory space in San Diego, California, under a lease that expires in 2026, with the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five years. In April 2024, we entered into a sublease agreement to rent 105,000 square feet for office and laboratory space for the Company’s future corporate headquarters. We also have an option and a right of first refusal for an additional 80,000 square feet in an adjacent available building, which we have not exercised. The term of the sublease is approximately 9 years, 9 months with payments expected to begin in August 2025. We believe that our current and expected future facilities are adequate to meet our needs and that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if required.
