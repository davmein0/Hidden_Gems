Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business. On April 26, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a lawsuit, captioned Klobus v. Akero Therapeutics, Inc., No. 3:24-cv-02534 (N.D. Cal.), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and three of its officers. The suit purports to be filed on behalf of a class of stockholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Company common stock between September 13, 2022, and October 9, 2023. The suit asserts claims under the Exchange Act for alleged misstatements and omissions regarding the Company’s Phase 2b SYMMETRY study. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel on August 2,

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying footnotes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Because of many factors, including those factors set forth in Part 1, Item 1A “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. MASH is a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and death. Our lead product candidate, efruxifermin, or EFX, is an analog of fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, which is an endogenously expressed hormone that protects against cellular stress and regulates metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins throughout the body. We have initiated a Phase 3 program called SYNCHRONY, which is comprised of three ongoing clinical trials (Outcomes, Histology, and Real-World) designed to support applications for marketing approval for patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3). The SYNCHRONY program builds on two biopsy-based Phase 2b trials in corresponding patient populations, with a combined total of over 300 patients treated for up to 96 weeks. Based on the statistically significant reversal of cirrhosis and fibrosis regression among patients with either biopsy-confirmed compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH or pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3) observed in our Phase 2b clinical trials, we believe EFX has the potential, if approved, to be an important medicine for treating MASH.

Results from five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating EFX have been reported, and across all trials reported to date a total of 385 adult patients with either MASH and/or type 2 diabetes have been treated with EFX and evaluated for up to 96 weeks. An additional 66 healthy volunteers or patients with severe hepatic impairment were evaluated in open label, single-dose clinical pharmacology studies.

In January 2025, we reported preliminary topline week 96 results from SYMMETRY, a Phase 2b trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed compensated cirrhosis (F4), Child-Pugh Class A, due to MASH. At week 96, among patients with baseline and week 96 biopsies (n=134), 39% of patients treated with 50mg EFX (n=46) (p=0.009) experienced reversal of cirrhosis with no worsening of MASH, compared to 15% for placebo (n=47).

In March 2024, we reported preliminary topline week 96 results from HARMONY, a Phase 2b trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of EFX in patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH, fibrosis stage 2 or 3 (F2-F3). The trial previously met its primary endpoint of ≥1 stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of MASH after 24 weeks of treatment for both the 50mg EFX (41%) and 28mg EFX (39%) dose groups, compared to 20% for the placebo arm. At week 96, the response rates on this endpoint increased to 75% (p<0.001) for 50mg EFX and 46% (p=0.07) for 28mg EFX, compared to 24% for placebo.

EFX has been reported to be generally well-tolerated across clinical trials of EFX to date. Most adverse events, or AEs, were mild or moderate. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting as well as injection site reactions were generally the most common AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation through each study's primary analysis period have been low, ranging from less than 5% in patients with F1-F3 MASH to less than 10% in subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to MASH (F4).

Enrollment for a multi-trial, global Phase 3 program called SYNCHRONY began in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program consists of three trials, SYNCHRONY 
Outcomes
, SYNCHRONY 
Histology
, and SYNCHRONY

with compensated cirrhosis (F4), Child-Pugh Class A, due to MASH. SYNCHRONY 
Histology 
is a two-cohort trial evaluating EFX for treatment of patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH, fibrosis stage 2 or 3 (F2-F3). SYNCHRONY 
Real-World 
is evaluating EFX for treatment of patients with fibrosis stages 1 through 4, compensated (F1-F4, compensated). In January 2025, we announced the completion of enrollment of the double-blind portion of SYNCHRONY 
Real-World
. Results from the SYNCHRONY 
Real-World
 trial are expected in the first half of 2026.

In five separate clinical trials in patients with MASH and/or type 2 diabetes, EFX has been observed to reverse fibrosis, resolve steatohepatitis, and help restore healthy metabolism to the whole body. Consequently, we believe EFX holds the potential to be an important medicine for treatment of MASH, if approved. We also believe EFX may be able to be used in combination with other therapies for potentially greater effect in certain subpopulations, particularly among the substantial proportion of patients with both MASH and type 2 diabetes who are expected to be treated with GLP-1 therapeutics to manage their diabetes and/or obesity.

We were incorporated in January 2017 and have devoted substantially all of our efforts to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing rights to EFX, research and development activities for EFX, building our intellectual property portfolio, exploring pipeline expansion opportunities, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have raised capital principally through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the initial public offering of our common stock in June 2019, and the sales of common stock in equity offerings in 2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024, including a $25.0 million equity investment from Pfizer, Inc., in 2022. We have also borrowed $35.0 million from a Term Loan provided by Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of EFX, if approved, and any future product candidates. Our net losses were $252.1 million, $151.8 million and $112.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $826.2 million.

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for at least the next several years as we advance EFX through later-stage clinical development, develop additional product candidates and seek regulatory approval of any product candidates that complete clinical development. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution.

We may also incur expenses in connection with the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities of $797.8 million. In addition, on January 30, 2025, we closed a public offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants resulting in gross proceeds of $402.5 million. Together with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2024, we believe this will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan into 2028.

Components of our results of operations

Revenue

We have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future, if at all. If our development efforts for EFX or additional product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or if we enter into collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.

Operating expenses

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of EFX, as well as unrelated discovery stage program expenses. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:

•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;

•
expenses incurred under agreements with CROs that are primarily engaged in the oversight and conduct of our clinical trials; CMOs that are primarily engaged to provide drug substance and product for our clinical trials, research and development programs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, nonclinical studies and other scientific development services;

•
the cost of acquiring and manufacturing nonclinical and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing registration and validation batches;

•
costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; and

•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements.

Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.

Product candidates in later stages of clinical development, such as EFX, generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of EFX and any future product candidates.

Our clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:

•
per patient trial costs;

•
the number of sites included in the trials;

•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;

•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;

•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;

•
the number of doses that patients receive;

•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients enrolled in clinical trials;

•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;

•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;

•
any setbacks or delays to the initiation or completion of preclinical or non-clinical studies, product development or clinical trials;

•
the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates, including on account of any disruption or delays to the supply of our product candidates;

104

Table of Contents

•
the phase of development of our product candidates; and

•
the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates.

The successful development and commercialization of product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:

•
the timing and progress of nonclinical and clinical development activities;

•
the number and scope of nonclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;

•
the ability to raise necessary additional funds;

•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements;

•
our ability to maintain our current development program and to establish new ones;

•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;

•
the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;

•
the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;

•
the availability of drug substance, drug product, and delivery devices utilized in the production of our product candidate;

•
establishing and maintaining agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidate is approved;

•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;

•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;

•
the commercialization of our product candidate, if and when approved;

•
obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement;

•
the acceptance of our product candidate, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;

•
competition with other products; 

•
the impacts of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, on the supply of our product candidate and ability to successfully initiate and complete preclinical and non-clinical studies and clinical trials, to receive regulatory approval for our product candidate and to commercialize our product candidate, if approved; and

•
a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapy following approval.

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, finance, corporate and business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses; marketing expenses and other operating costs.

We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support development of EFX and our continued research activities. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, tax, regulatory, compliance, and director and officer insurance costs, as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements.

Interest expense

Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our term loan with Hercules.

105

Table of Contents

Other income

Other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities.

Income taxes

Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each period or for our earned research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $333.0 million and $660.8 million which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expire at various dates beginning in 2037. The federal net operating loss carryforwards include $330.5 million, which may be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $26.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities which expire at various dates beginning in 2033, respectively. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.

Table of Contents

attributed primarily to a $27.9 million increase in CRO expenses for our ongoing HARMONY, SYMMETRY, and SYNCHRONY clinical trials, an $18.3 million increase in third-party contract manufacturing expenses for EFX, a $7.5 million milestone payment to Amgen in connection with dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program and a $0.6 million increase in other research and development costs. Personnel and other research and development related expenses increased $2.2 million; attributed to $1.4 million increase in other non-EFX related research and development activities and a $1.3 million increase in wage and wage-related expenses resulting from increased staff, offset by a $0.5 million decrease in stock-based compensation. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned manufacturing and clinical development activities in the near term and in the future to support the ongoing programs.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were $31.1 million and $29.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $1.2 million which was due primarily to a $1.5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses associated with running the company and a $0.9 million increase in other wage and wage-related expenses resulting from increased staff, offset by a $1.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation.

Interest expense

Interest expense was $3.1 million and $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $2.4 million related to the Hercules term loan.

Interest and other income

Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2023 is comprised primarily of $24.2 million of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term term marketable securities compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is related to increased investment returns on our cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term and marketable securities.

Liquidity and capital resources

We have incurred significant operating losses from our inception through December 31, 2024. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of products for several years, if at all. Through December 31, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, the initial public offering of our common stock in June 2019, and follow-on public offerings of our common stock in 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024 and January 2025. We have also funded our operations through the sale of common stock under ATM offerings, raising gross proceeds of $127.4 million in 2023, $80.3 million in 2024 and $10.6 million in January of 2025. In January 2025, we raised gross proceeds of $402.5 million from a follow-on public offering of our common stock. Other sources of working capital include a $25.0 million equity investment from Pfizer, Inc. in 2022 and $35.0 million in cumulative borrowings from a Term Loan provided by Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules.

From our inception through December 31, 2024, these and other funding sources have provided gross proceeds totaling $1,497.3 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents short and long-term marketable securities of $797.8 million. We have invested our cash resources primarily in liquid money market accounts, U.S Treasuries and agency securities, commercial paper and corporate debt securities.

Cash flows from operating activities

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $230.1 million, consisting of a net loss of $252.1 million offset by non-cash charges of $19.0 million, including $29.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, offset by a decrease of $13.1 million from net amortization of premiums from investments, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $3.0 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of payments and prepayments to our CROs and CMOs for ongoing clinical trial and manufacturing activities.

The changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to $6.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and $0.6 million increase in accounts payable, most of which are related to the timing of payments and prepayments to our CROs and CMOs for ongoing clinical trial and manufacturing activities. These amounts were partially offset by $0.9 million decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities mostly related to the timing of prepayments and payments to our CMOs and CROs for ongoing clinical trial and manufacturing activities.

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $92.5 million, consisting of a net loss of $112.0 million offset by non-cash charges of $24.0 million, including $23.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.5 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to $2.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and $1.0 million increase in accounts payable,  all of which are related to the timing of payments and prepayments to our CROs and CMOs for ongoing clinical trial and manufacturing activities. These amounts were partially offset by $7.3 million decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities mostly related to the timing of prepayments and payments to our CMOs and CROs for ongoing clinical trial and manufacturing activities.

provided by Hercules and $5.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of employee stock purchase plan shares.

Description of Indebtedness

We have outstanding borrowings of $35.0 million under a loan and security agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Hercules. We may borrow an additional $30.0 million at our sole discretion until June 15, 2025 and an additional $35.0 million at our sole discretion until June 15, 2026. In addition, up to an additional $50.0 million may become available to us at Hercules’ sole discretion. Borrowings under the loan are repayable in monthly interest-only payments until January 1, 2026. The interest-only period will be followed by equal monthly payments of principal plus interest until the loan maturity date of March 1, 2027. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 7.65% and (b) the Prime Rate (as reported in the Wall Street Journal) plus 3.65%. A further description of the Loan Agreement is presented in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

Funding requirements

Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, research and development services, compensation and related expenses and general overhead costs. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. In addition, since the closing of our initial public offering ("IPO"), we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:

•
the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for EFX or any future product candidates we may develop; 

•
timing delays, if any, with respect to preclinical and clinical development of EFX or any future product candidates we may develop as a result of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, or from the impact of geopolitical tensions;

•
our ability to maintain our license to EFX from Amgen;

•
the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more nonclinical studies or clinical trials than those that we currently expect or change their requirements on studies or trials that had previously been agreed to;

•
the cost to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights;

•
the effect of competing technological and market developments;

•
market acceptance of any approved product candidate, including product pricing, as well as product coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors;

•
the cost of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;

•
the cost and timing of selecting, auditing and potentially validating a manufacturing site for commercial scale manufacturing;

•
the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we determine to commercialize; and

•
our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.

We expect that we will require additional funding to complete the clinical development of EFX, commercialize EFX, if we receive regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for EFX or other product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on whether we choose to commercialize EFX ourselves.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing,

110

Table of Contents

distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interest may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Contractual obligations and other commitments

We have entered into agreements with CROs and CMOs to provide services in connection with our nonclinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture clinical development materials. Apart from the contracts with non-cancelable purchase commitments, we have entered into other contracts in the normal course of business with certain CROs, CMOs, and other third parties for nonclinical research studies and testing, clinical trials and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation.

Non-cancelable purchase and other arrangements decreased to $25.6 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $32.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $6.5 million was primarily attributable to $6.1 million decrease in the purchase and other obligations that support our clinical trials activities and a $0.3 million decrease in operating lease obligations for the office space in South San Francisco, California.

Under the Amgen Agreement, we are obligated to pay Amgen up to $30.0 million in connection with marketing approvals, and aggregate milestone payments of up to $75.0 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones for all products licensed under the agreement. Commencing on the first commercial sale of licensed products, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on escalating tiers of annual net sales of licensed products ranging from low to high single-digit percentages. The amount and timing of any contingent payment obligations to Amgen are not currently known. The first clinical milestone, in the amount of $2.5 million, was paid to Amgen in August 2019 and a second milestone of $7.5 million was paid in December 2023 with dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program.

Critical accounting policies and estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Research and development expenses

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued and prepaid research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and

111

Table of Contents

estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our research and development expenses, and related prepaids and accruals, as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued and prepaid research and development expenses include fees paid to:

•
vendors in connection with nonclinical development activities;

•
CROs and investigative sites in connection with nonclinical studies and clinical trials; and 

•
CMOs in connection with the production of nonclinical and clinical trial materials.

We base the expense recorded related to external research and development on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage nonclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued and prepaid research and development expenses.

Stock-based compensation

We measure all stock option awards granted to employees and nonemployees based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, on a straight-line basis. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for awards that contain performance-based conditions using the accelerated attribution method when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Prior to our initial public offering, the exercise price for all stock options granted was at the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock as determined on the date of grant by our board of directors. Stock-based compensation for restricted stock units is measured based on the market closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally four years.

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and our expected dividend yield. We currently estimate our expected share price volatility using a combination weighting of the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and the volatility of our traded share price and expect to continue to do so until mid-2025. The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the "simplified" method for awards that qualify as "plain-vanilla" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The fair value of each restricted common stock award is estimated on the date of grant based on the fair value of our common stock on that same date.

Compensation expense for purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is recognized based on the fair value of the common stock estimated based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of offering, less the purchase discount percentage provided for in the plan.

Stock-based compensation expense was $29.7 million, $21.5 million and $23.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $58.7 million and $18.3 million of

112

Table of Contents

unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to stock options and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.71 years and 3.18 years for stock options and RSUs, respectively.

We have not recognized, and we do not expect to recognize in the near future, any tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense as a result of the full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets including deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carryforwards.

Recent accounting pronouncements

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business. None of these pronouncements had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities of $797.8 million as of December 31, 2024, which consisted primarily of money market funds and U.S. Treasury-backed securities which are investment grade.

The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality and short and long-term duration, according to our board-approved investment policy. Our investments are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase.

Additionally, the Company has a variable interest rate term loan that is impacted by the increase in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Currency Risk

The majority of our transactions occur in U.S. dollars. However, we do have certain transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affects the reported amounts of expenses, assets and liabilities primarily associated with a limited number of manufacturing activities. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Inflation Risk

Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some effect in the near future (especially if inflation rates continue to rise) due to an impact on the costs to conduct clinical trials, manufacturing and supply costs, labor costs we incur to attract and retain qualified personnel, and other operational costs. Inflationary costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Akero Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Akero Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Research and development expenses related to contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company incurs certain research and development expenses from third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”) and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”). The Company recognizes and measures these expenses based on the date on which services commence and the extent of services performed during the applicable reporting period. Depending on the timing of payments to and services provided by the third-parties, the Company recognizes accrued expenses or prepaid expenses.

In estimating the extent of services performed, the Company utilizes information supplied by third-party CROs and CMOs and discussions with Company research and development personnel, pertaining to the progress and status of research and development activities under contract.

We identified research and development costs related to CROs and CMOs as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for the Company to estimate the extent of service performed and the associated expense

115

Table of Contents

incurred. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when auditing the Company’s estimates of the extent of services performed and expenses incurred and evaluating the results of those procedures.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to research and development expenses related to CROs and CMOs included the following, among others:

•
We evaluated the Company’s overall estimation methodology and assumptions as compared to the evidence obtained.

•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the estimation of research and development expenses related to CROs and CMOs.

•
We evaluated publicly available information and board of directors’ materials regarding the status of research and development activities.

•
We made selections and tested on a sample basis the research and development expenses related to CROs and CMOs balances by:

o
Obtaining and reading the related contracts to understand key provisions and agreeing them to the Company’s analysis.

o
Obtaining and inspecting third-party documents received from the vendors related to the services provided and comparing them to the Company’s schedule of estimated expenses incurred to date.

o
Obtaining and inspecting confirmations from select vendors confirming the accuracy and completeness of the data and information provided to the Company. 

o
Testing the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimates of the services provided.

o
Inspecting meeting minutes between the Company’s finance team and clinical and manufacturing operations teams, and corroborating the progress of research and development activities through inquiry with the Company’s clinical operations and manufacturing operations personnel.

•
We examined subsequent invoices received from vendors and cash disbursements made subsequent to the balance sheet date and inquired of clinical and manufacturing operations to corroborate the applicable service period in order to evaluate completeness of the research and development expenses related to CROs and CMOs.

Akero Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

1.           Nature of the business and basis of presentation
Akero Therapeutics, Inc., together with its wholly owned subsidiary Akero Securities Corporation, (“Akero” or the “Company”), is
 a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. MASH is a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and death. The Company's lead product candidate, efruxifermin, or EFX, is an analog of fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, which is an endogenously expressed hormone that protects against cellular stress and regulates metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins throughout the body. The Company has initiated a Phase 3 program called SYNCHRONY, which is comprised of 
three
 ongoing clinical trials (
Outcomes
, 
Histology
, and 
Real-World
) designed to support applications for marketing approval for patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3) and compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH. The SYNCHRONY program builds on two biopsy-based Phase 2b trials in corresponding patient populations, with a combined total of over 
300
 patients treated for up to 96 weeks. Based on statistically significant fibrosis regression and MASH resolution among patients with either biopsy-confirmed pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3) or compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH, the Company believes EFX has the potential, if approved, to be an important medicine for treating MASH.
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to mid-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, completion and success of clinical testing, preparation for a potential commercial launch of EFX, if approved, development by competitors of new technological innovations, compliance with governmental regulations, dependence on key personnel and protection of proprietary technology and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. EFX will require extensive clinical testing prior to regulatory approval and commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company’s drug development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.

Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. All adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented have been reflected.

Liquidity
In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15, 
Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
, the Company has evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.
Since its inception, the Company has raised $
1,497,264
 in capital funds, including $
105,800
 in proceeds from its initial public offering (“IPO”) in June 2019, $
1,265,964
 in proceeds from the sales of common stock in equity offerings between 2020 and 2024, which includes a $
25,000
 equity investment from Pfizer, Inc. in 2022, $
90,500
 in proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and $
35,000
 in venture debt borrowings. The Company has incurred recurring losses since its inception, including net losses of $
252,060
, $
151,759
 and $
112,033
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
826,156
. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, the Company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities of $
797,829
 as 
of December 31, 2024, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The Company expects that it will require additional funding to complete the clinical

development 
of EFX, commercialize EFX, if it receives regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates.
If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all.

2.           Summary of significant accounting policies
Operating segment information

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate and discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has one operating segment. The Company’s focus is the research and development of treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including MASH. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, its chief executive officer, manages the Company’s operations on a consolidated basis for the purpose of allocating resources.
Use of estimates
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the recognition of research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, warrant liabilities and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates when there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts invested in money market accounts. The fair value of cash equivalents approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of such financial instruments.
Short and long-term marketable securities
The 
Company invests in short-term and long-term marketable securities, primarily money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities and corporate debt securities. The Company continually evaluates the credit ratings of its investment portfolio and underlying securities. The Company invests in accordance with its investment policy and invests at the date of purchase in securities with high ratings from top rating agencies. The Company classifies its short-term and long-term marketable securities as available-for-sale securities and reports them at fair value in short and long-term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets with related unrealized gains and losses included within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. The amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When the fair value is below the amortized cost of a marketable security, the Company reviews and determines whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. The credit-related impairment amount is recognized in other income on the consolidated

122

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

statements 
of operations and comprehensive loss, with a corresponding allowance for credit losses account in the consolidated balance sheet. Subsequent improvements in expected credit losses are recognized as a reversal of an amount in the allowance account. If the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the allowance for the credit loss is written-off and the excess of the amortized cost basis of the asset over its fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no credit losses recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Restricted cash
As of December 31, 2022, the Company was required to maintain a separate cash balance of $
108
 for the benefit of the landlord in connection with the Company’s Gateway office space lease in South San Francisco, California (the “Gateway Lease”), which is classified within other assets (non-current) on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 12). The Company was not required to maintain a separate cash balance for the benefit of the landlord as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Concentrations of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities. Periodically, the Company maintains deposits in accredited financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company deposits its cash investments in financial institutions that it believes have high credit quality and has not experienced any losses on such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. At December 31, 2024, all of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments were held at three accredited financial

institutions.

Leases

The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the Company has the right to control the identified asset. Right-of-use (“ROU”), assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are based on the measurement of the lease liability and are further adjusted by any lease payments made prior to or on lease commencement, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable.  The Company has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of one year or less on its balance sheet. Operating lease costs included in the measurement of the lease are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred as an operating expense.
The Company determines the lease classification and the present value of future lease payments at the time of the lease commencement using an incremental borrowing rate that it estimates based upon the Company’s credit risk and term of the lease. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts has not historically been readily determinable and the Company must therefore use the appropriate incremental borrowing rate to measure its leases. To estimate the incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to the Company is estimated using a synthetic credit rating analysis since the Company does not currently have a rating agency-based credit rating.

Research and development costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to discover, research and develop drug candidates, including personnel expenses, stock-based compensation expense, third-party license fees and external costs including fees paid to consultants, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and clinical research organizations, or CROs, in connection with drug product manufacturing, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work, clinical trial database management, clinical trial material management and statistical compilation and

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

analysis. Non-refundable prepayments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the purchase of contract manufacturing services are included as a component of research and development expense.

Costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged immediately to research and development expense if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future uses.
Accrued and prepaid research and development expenses
The Company has entered into various research and development and other agreements with commercial firms, researchers and others for provisions of goods and services. These agreements are generally cancelable, and the related costs are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The Company makes estimates of accrued and prepaid research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known at that time. 
 When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities and the appropriateness of the prepaid expenses, the Company analyzes progress of the studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued and prepaid balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the Company's estimates.

Stock-based compensation
The Company makes stock-based awards from its stock compensation plans (see Note 8). The Company measures all stock option awards granted to employees and nonemployees based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, on a straight-line basis. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards that contain performance-based conditions using the accelerated attribution method when management determines it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The Company measures for restricted stock units awards based on the market closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense for these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally four years.
The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company's expected dividend yield. The Company currently estimates its share price volatility using a combined weighting of the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and the volatility of its traded share price and expects to continue to do so until mid-2025. The expected term of the Company's stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on common stock and the expectation that it will not pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Compensation expense for purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is recognized based on the fair value of the common stock estimated based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of offering, less the purchase discount percentage provided for in the plan.
The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments 
are classified.

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

Loan Payable

Loan Payable represents borrowings under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated June 15, 2022 (“Loan Agreement”) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”), subsequently amended on June 7, 2023 and February 28, 2024, which the Company has accounted for as a debt financing arrangement. Interest expense is accrued using the effective interest rate method over the estimated period the loan will be repaid. Loan issuance costs have been recorded as a debt discount in the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized and recorded as interest expense throughout the life of the Loan Agreement using the effective interest rate method. The Company considered whether there were any embedded features in the Loan Agreement that require bifurcation and separate accounting as derivative financial instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
.
The Loan Agreement was amended on February 28, 2024. The Company accounted for the amendment as a debt modification arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 470, 
Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments
.
Warrant liabilities

The Company accounts for warrants anticipated to be issued in the future under the Loan Agreement as liabilities and measures them at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each prospective balance sheet date, with any changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company's tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.
Net loss per share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration of common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive given the Company’s net loss.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU No. 2023-07

The amendment introduced new requirements to disclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and extend certain annual disclosures to interim periods. Entities with a single reportable segment must apply ASC
 280 in its entirety, are permitted to report more than one measure of segment profit or loss under certain conditions and are required to disclose the title and position of the CODM. ASU No. 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 effective January 1, 2024. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company's related disclosures (see Note 13).
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
.  Under ASU 2023-09, entities are required to uniformly classify and present greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is intended to benefit investors by improving the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
, which will improve the disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions such as cost of sales, selling, general and administrative, and research and development. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available. The amendments should be applied on either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the amendments and the effect on its future consolidated financial statements.

3.            Fair value measurements

Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:
•
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2—Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are 
no
t active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

•
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or 
no
 market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.
The following is a summary of the Company's financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Level 2 assets were valued by the Company using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities.

The carrying values of the Company’s prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
The Loan Payable is classified as a Level 3 liability. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Loan Payable, approximates its fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black-Scholes model based on key assumption and inputs (see Note 6). The Company utilizes a probability assessment to estimate the likelihood of vesting for the remaining Loan Agreement warrants and allocated the probability of occurrence percentage to the fair values calculated.

6.           Loan Payable and Warrant Liability
On June 15, 2022, the Company entered into the Loan Agreement with Hercules, which was subsequently amended on June 7, 2023 and February 28, 2024, for an aggregate principal amount of $
150,000
 (“Term Loan”). Pursuant to the amended Loan Agreement, the Term Loan is available to the Company in 
five
 tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions.
Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company received $
10,000
 upon closing, $
15,000
 was borrowed in March 2023 and an additional $
10,000
 was borrowed in connection with the second amendment on February 28, 2024 (the “Tranche I and Tranche II Commitments”). At the sole discretion of the Company, $
30,000
 is available to be drawn from 
June 15, 2024
 through 
June 15, 2025
 (“Tranche III Commitment”). Also at the sole discretion of the Company, an additional $
35,000
 is available to be drawn at the earlier of the full draw of Tranche III or 
June 15, 2025
 through 
June 15, 2026
 (“Tranche IV Commitment”). An additional $
50,000
 may become available to the Company prior to January 1, 2026, subject to Hercules' approval (“Tranche V Commitment”). 
The Term Loan will mature on 
March 1, 2027
 (the “Maturity Date”). The Term Loan bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (a) 
7.65
% and (b) the Prime Rate (as reported in the Wall Street Journal) plus 
3.65
% (the “Interest Rate”). The Company makes payments of interest only until January 1, 2026 (the “interest-only period”). After the interest-only period, the principal balance and related interest are required to be repaid in equal monthly installments and continuing until the Maturity Date.
The Loan Agreement contains customary closing fees, events of default, and representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance in the future in relation to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan. The Loan Agreement is secured by most of the Company's assets, including its bank and investment accounts. The Loan Agreement provides for a prepayment charge equal to 
1
% of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan. In addition, the Loan Agreement provides for an End of Term Charge equal to the greater of 
5.85
% of the outstanding principal balance, or $
2,048
, which is recognized as a debt discount and is being accreted into the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan payable.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
The Loan Agreement requires the Company to issue warrants to Hercules to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (“common stock”). The amount of shares that may be purchased for the warrants will not exceed 
1.5
% multiplied by the greater of Tranche I and the aggregate original amount of the term loan advances, divided by the exercise price of the warrants. Upon closing, the Company issued to Hercules warrants to purchase 
36,718
 shares of Company’s common stock and recognized them at their relative fair value of $
227
 as of the date of issuance in the shareholders equity category of the balance sheet.

In accordance with ASC 815-40, additional warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock that the Company is contingently required to issue are recognized at their relative fair value in the noncurrent liabilities category

of the balance sheet, given the variable settlement amount of the warrant shares. The fair value of the equity and liability classified warrants are collectively recognized as a debt discount and are being accreted into the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan. The Company reassesses the fair value of the warrant liability at the end of each reporting period.

On March 10, 2023, the Company issued warrants to purchase 
9,180
 shares of the Company's common stock in connection with the $
15,000
 borrowed from Hercules on that date, and the fair value associated with these warrants of $
330
 was reclassified from warrant liability to additional paid in capital. On February 28, 2024, the Company issued warrants to purchase 
18,359
 shares of the Company's common stock in connection with the $
10,000
 borrowed from Hercules on that date, and the fair value associated with these warrants of $
431
 was reclassified from warrant liability to additional paid in capital.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company is contingently liable to issue warrants to purchase up to an additional 
211,137
 shares of common stock under the Loan Agreement, in connection with future borrowings as they may occur.
Future principal debt payments on the currently outstanding loan payable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

The total number of shares of common stock that could have been issued under the 2018 Plan was 
3,071,960
 shares, of which

 shares remained available for grant on June 18, 2019, the date that the Company’s 2019 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) became effective. Upon the effectiveness of the 2019 Plan, the 
107,635
 remaining shares available under the 2018 Plan were transferred and became available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. Shares of common stock underlying outstanding awards under the 2018 Plan that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon exercise or settlement of an award to satisfy the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of stock, expire or are otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) will be added to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.

The 2019 Plan became effective on June 18, 2019 and replaced the Company’s 2018 Plan on that date.

The number of shares initially reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan was 
2,572,457
, which included the

 shares transferred from the 2018 Plan, and shall be cumulatively increased on each January 1 by 
4
% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors or compensation committee of the board of directors. The 2019 Plan was increased by 
1,874,608
 shares on January 1, 2023 and by 
2,230,177
 shares on January 1, 2024.

The 2019 Plan is administered by the board of directors or, at the discretion of the board of directors, by a committee of the board of directors. The exercise prices, vesting and other restrictions are determined at the discretion of the board of directors, or its committee if so delegated, except that the exercise price per share of stock options may not be less than 
100
% of the fair market value of the share of common stock on the date of grant and the term of stock option may not be greater than 
ten years
. All incentive options granted to any person possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares may not have an exercise price of less than 
110
% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Stock options granted to employees, officers, members of the board of directors and consultants will typically vest over a 
four-year
 period.

Shares that are expired, terminated, surrendered or canceled under the 2019 Plan without having been fully exercised will be available for future awards.

2019 Employee stock purchase plan

The 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2019 ESPP”) was adopted and approved by the Company’s board of directors in May 2019 and by the Company’s stockholders in June 2019. The 2019 ESPP became effective on June 18, 2019, at which time 
273,869
 shares were reserved for issuance. The 2019 ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2020 and each January 1 through January 1, 2029, by the least of (i) 
1
% of the outstanding number of shares of the Company’s common stock on the immediately preceding December 31, (ii) 
410,803
 shares or (iii) such number of shares as determined by the compensation committee. The 2019 ESPP was increased by 
410,803
 shares on January 1, 2023 and by 
410,803
 shares on January 1, 2024.

9.           Amgen license agreement
In June 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with Amgen, Inc. (“Amgen”) pursuant to which the Company was granted an exclusive license to certain patents and intellectual property related to a long-acting FGF21 analog in order to commercially develop, manufacture, use and distribute FGF21 as a treatment for MASH and other serious metabolic diseases. The Amgen Agreement provides the Company with exclusive global rights to the licensed products and the right to grant sublicenses that cover EFX to third parties.
In exchange for these rights, the Company made an upfront payment of $
5,000
 and issued 
2,653,333
 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a fair value of $
1,353
 to Amgen. Amgen was also entitled to maintain a 
10
% 
ownership interest of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, on a fully diluted and converted basis, through the second closing of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock financing. In November 2018, in connection with the second

135

Table of Contents

Akero Therapeutics, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

closing 
of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock financing, the Company issued 
3,205,128
 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Amgen for a total value of $
7,404
, satisfying its anti-dilution obligation under the Amgen Agreement.

Under the Amgen Agreement, the Company 
made a milestone payment in the third quarter of 2019 of $
2,500
 in connection with dosing the first patient in the BALANCED study, a second milestone payment 
of $
7,500
 was paid in December 2023 with dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program, 
and is
 obligated to pay Amgen up to $
30,000
 in connection with marketing approvals, and aggregate milestone payments of up to $
75,000
 upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones for all products licensed under
 the Amgen Agreement.

Under the Amgen Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Amgen tiered royalties ranging from a low to high single-digit percentages on annual net sales of the licensed products, beginning on the first commercial sale of such licensed products in each country and expiring on a country-by-country basis on the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering such licensed products in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country, and (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The royalty payments are subject to reduction under specified conditions set forth in the Amgen Agreement.
The Company is solely responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercial activities and costs of the licensed products, including clinical studies or other tests necessary to support the use of a licensed product. The Company is also responsible for costs related to the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights.
The Amgen Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the royalty term in all countries for all licensed products. The Amgen Agreement may be terminated by either party with at least 90 days' notice in the event of material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days, by either party for insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party and immediately by Amgen if the Company challenges the licensed patents. The Company may also terminate the Amgen Agreement with 90 days' written notice for discretionary reasons such as scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial issues, as defined in the Amgen Agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $
7,500
 in research and development expense under the Amgen license in connection with dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program. There was 
no
 expense recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.

10.           Income taxes
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did 
no
t record any income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred or for the research and development tax credits generated in each period due to its uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. All of the Company’s operating losses since inception have been generated in the United States.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
332,960
 and $
660,787
, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2037. The federal net operating loss carryforwards include $
330,517
, which may be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
26,442
 and $
3,448
, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2033. During the year ended December 31, 2024, gross deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance, increased by $
64,690
, due to the operating loss incurred by the Company during that period.
Utilization 
of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three‑year period. The annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the Company's stock at the time of such ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate.  Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company determined that ownership changes occurred on March 24, 2017, June 7, 2018, July 8, 2020 and May 31, 2024. As a result of the ownership changes,

approximately 
$
2,118
, $
3,110
, and $
3,598
 of the NOLs will expire unutilized for federal, California and Massachusetts purposes, respectively.  The ability of the Company to use its remaining NOL carryforwards may be further limited if the Company experiences a Code Section 382 ownership change as a result of future changes in its stock ownership.
 The Company’s research and development credits are subject to Code Section 383 and are limited due to the ownership changes that the Company has experienced. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has derecognized approximately $
1,915
 and $
43
 of gross federal a
nd state research and development credits, respectively. The Company has not derecognized any of the California research and development credit-related deferred tax assets because the credits do not expire.
The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize its deferred tax assets at each reporting period. In doing so, the Company has considered its history of cumulative net losses incurred and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period.
Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023  related primarily to the increase in net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards and were as follows:

, none of which if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate in a future period, due to the Company's full valuation allowance on U.S. net deferred tax assets.  The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income taxes as part of its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
t accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts had been recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company will file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Colorado, Connecticut, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia, as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable.  There are currently no pending tax examinations.  The Company is open to future tax examination under statute from 2019 to the present.

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)

Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the period incurred and requires amortization over five years or fifteen years pursuant to IRC Section 174. The Company is projected to remain in a taxable loss position even after the capitalization of R&D expenditures, and thus the new requirement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2024.
In general, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, California law conforms to the IRC as of January 1, 2015. California has not conformed to the federal changes made to the IRC by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Public Law 115-97, enacted on December 22, 2017). In the context of IRC 174, California allows taxpayers to immediately expense R&D costs or capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures over a 5-year recovery period. Thus, the new requirements to capitalize R&D will have no material impact on the state income tax provision.
On September 8, 2023, the IRS released an advance version of Notice 2023-63 (“Notice”) which provides interim guidance to clarify the capitalization and amortization of specified research and experimental (“SRE”) expenditures under IRC Section 174, as amended by TCJA in 2017.  The Notice addresses issues related to short tax years and the definition of the midpoint of the taxable year, the types of costs that constitute SRE expenditures including allocation methods, software development, research performed under contract, dispositions of property, and the treatment of SRE expenditures for long-term contract rules under section 460. The Notice also announces that the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to issue proposed regulations providing rules consistent with the guidance in the Notice applicable for tax years ending after September 8, 2023, and until then taxpayers may rely on the interim guidance in the notice, provided the taxpayer applies all of the rules in a consistent manner. The Company does not anticipate the guidance in the Notice to have material impact on the tax provision and will continue to monitor the development of the proposed regulations.
Accordingly, the Company is estimating 2024, 2023 and 2022 capitalization of U.S R&D expenditures net of 2024 and 2023 amortization of approximately $
162,647
, $
65,437
 and $
57,658
 (an addback to estimated 2023 and 2022 US taxable income), respectively. Additionally, the requirement to capitalize and amortize foreign R&D expenses over 
15 years
 resulted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 capitalization of R&D expenditures (net of amortization) of $
76,595
, $
65,899
 and $
14,728
, respectively.
On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA includes implementation of a new alternative minimum tax, an excise tax on stock buybacks, and significant tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. The Company is evaluating the provisions included under the IRA and does not expect the provisions to have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
All tax returns will remain open for examination by the federal and state taxing authorities for three and four years, respectively, from the date of utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards or research and development credits.

The Company’s potentially dilutive securities, which include stock options, warrants and unvested restricted stock units, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same. The Company excluded the following potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.

On April 26, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a lawsuit, captioned Klobus v. Akero Therapeutics, Inc., No. 3:24-cv-02534 (N.D. Cal.), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and three of its officers. The suit purports to be filed on behalf of a class of stockholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Company common stock between September 13, 2022, and October 9, 2023. The suit asserts claims under the Exchange Act for alleged misstatements and omissions regarding the Company’s Phase 2b SYMMETRY study. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel on August 2, 2024.  Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 24, 2024. On November 18, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, Lead Plaintiffs filed an Opposition on January 13, 2025, and Defendants filed a Reply on February 21, 2025. A hearing on Defendants’ motion to dismiss is currently scheduled for March 11, 2025. Due to the early stage of this matter, it is not possible to determine the probability or amount of potential related costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act as of the end of December 31, 2024 on Form 10-K. Disclosure control and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management and our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on the results of our evaluation under that framework, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s financial statements included in this report on this 2024 Form 10-K and issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which is included herein.

Table of Contents

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Control.

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Akero Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Akero Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 	2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
