Overview

We are a clinical-stage company dedicated to developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. MASH is a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and death. Our lead product candidate, efruxifermin, or EFX, is an analog of fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, which is an endogenously expressed hormone that protects against cellular stress and regulates metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins throughout the body. We have initiated a Phase 3 program called SYNCHRONY, which is comprised of three ongoing clinical trials (
Outcomes
, 
Histology
, and 
Real-World
) designed to support applications for marketing approval for patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3). The SYNCHRONY program builds on two biopsy-based Phase 2b trials in corresponding patient populations, with a combined total of over 300 patients treated for up to 96 weeks. Based on the statistically significant reversal of cirrhosis and fibrosis regression among patients with either biopsy-confirmed compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH or pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3) observed in our Phase 2b clinical trials, we believe EFX has the potential, if approved, to be an important medicine for treating MASH.

Results from five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating EFX have been reported, and across all trials reported to date a total of 385 adult patients with either MASH and/or type 2 diabetes have been treated with EFX and evaluated for up to 96 weeks. An additional 66 healthy volunteers or patients with severe hepatic impairment were evaluated in open label, single-dose clinical pharmacology studies.

In January 2025, we reported preliminary topline week 96 results from SYMMETRY, a Phase 2b trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed compensated cirrhosis (F4), Child-Pugh Class A, due to MASH. The trial previously showed a numerical trend but not statistical significance on the primary endpoint of ≥1 stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of MASH after 36 weeks of treatment, with 24% and 22% for the 50mg and 28mg EFX dose groups, compared to 14% for the placebo arm. At week 96, among patients with baseline and week 96 biopsies (N=134), 39% of patients treated with 50mg EFX (n=46) (p=0.009) experienced reversal of cirrhosis with no worsening of MASH, compared to 15% for placebo (n=47). By intent to treat, or ITT, analysis (N=181), with all missing week 96 biopsies treated as failures, 29% of the 50mg EFX patients (n=63) (p=0.031) experienced reversal of cirrhosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis, compared to approximately 12% for placebo (n=61). Statistically significant results were also observed for MASH resolution by both completer and ITT analyses. In a subgroup of patients with baseline and week 96 biopsies who were not taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1) at baseline (N=97), 45% (p=0.009) in the 50mg EFX group (n=29) experienced reversal of cirrhosis with no worsening of MASH compared to 17% for placebo (n=36), suggesting that the observed reversal of cirrhosis was not attributable to GLP-1 therapy. Results for the 28mg EFX group on these measures were numerically higher than placebo but not statistically significant. Only the 50mg EFX group is being evaluated in the Phase 3 SYNCHRONY 
Outcomes 
study in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH.

In March 2024, we reported preliminary topline week 96 results from HARMONY, a Phase 2b trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of EFX in patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH, fibrosis stage 2 or 3 (F2-F3). The trial previously met its primary endpoint of ≥1 stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of MASH after 24 weeks of treatment for both the 50mg EFX (41%, p<0.001) and 28mg EFX (39%, p<0.001) dose groups, compared to 20% for the placebo arm. At week 96, the response rates on this endpoint increased to 75% (p<0.001) for 50mg EFX and 46% for 28mg EFX, compared to 24% for placebo. EFX was also observed to achieve statistical significance on additional histology endpoints at week 96. Notably, 36% (p=0.002) and 31% (p<0.001) of patients treated with 50mg EFX and 28mg EFX experienced a 2-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of MASH—which is more than 10-fold the placebo rate of 3%. In addition, among a subgroup of patients with F3 fibrosis at baseline (N=56), 68% (p<0.001) of patients in the 50mg EFX group were observed to achieve at least a 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of MASH, compared to 14% for placebo. Both the 28mg and 50mg EFX dose groups are being evaluated in the Phase 3 SYNCHRONY 
Histology 
study in patients with pre-cirrhotic (F2-F3) MASH.

EFX has been reported to be generally well-tolerated across completed clinical trials of EFX to date. Most adverse events, or AEs, were mild or moderate. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting as well as injection site reactions were generally the most common AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation through each study's primary analysis period have been low, ranging from less than 5% in patients with F1-F3 MASH to less than 10% in subjects with compensated cirrhosis due to MASH (F4).

Enrollment for a multi-trial, global Phase 3 program called SYNCHRONY began in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program consists of three trials, SYNCHRONY

. SYNCHRONY 
Outcomes 
is a two-cohort trial evaluating EFX for treatment of patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4), Child-Pugh Class A, due to MASH. Patients are receiving weekly injections of either EFX 50mg or placebo. The primary histology endpoint, for Cohort 1 only, is the proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis and no worsening of steatohepatitis after 96 weeks of treatment. The primary outcomes endpoint for all patients enrolled across Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 is the time from randomization to first occurrence of any protocol-specified clinical event. SYNCHRONY 
Histology 
is a two-cohort trial evaluating EFX for treatment of patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH, fibrosis stage 2 or 3 (F2-F3). Patients are receiving weekly injections of 28mg EFX, 50mg EFX, or placebo. The primary histology endpoint, for Cohort 1 only, to support an application for accelerated approval, is the proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 1-stage fibrosis improvement and resolution of MASH after 52 weeks of treatment. All patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be evaluated for long-term clinical outcomes for up to 240 weeks of treatment. Results for the 52-week primary histology endpoint from the SYNCHRONY 
Histology 
trial are expected in the first half of 2027. SYNCHRONY 
Real-World 
is evaluating EFX for treatment of patients with MASH, fibrosis stages 1 through 4, compensated (F1-F4, compensated). The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability will be assessed after 52 weeks of treatment. In January 2025, we announced completion of enrollment of the double-blind portion of SYNCHRONY

 trial are expected in the first half of 2026.

The FDA has granted both Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation for EFX for the treatment of MASH. In addition, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has granted a Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation for EFX for the treatment of MASH. The Fast Track and PRIME programs are designed to enhance regulatory support for the development of promising investigational medicines where early clinical data suggest the potential to meet a high unmet medical need. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation is meant to expedite development and review of a therapy for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapies. Benefits of these programs may include more frequent regulatory interactions, enhanced guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy, and accelerated assessment of marketing authorization, or MA, applications.

In five separate clinical trials in patients with MASH and/or type 2 diabetes, EFX has been observed to reverse cirrhosis, reverse moderate to advanced fibrosis, resolve steatohepatitis, and help restore healthy metabolism to the whole body. Consequently, we believe EFX, if approved, holds the potential to be an important medicine for treatment of patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and pre-cirrhotic (F2-F3) MASH. We also believe EFX may be able to be used in combination with other therapies for potentially greater effect in certain subpopulations, particularly among the substantial proportion of patients with both MASH and type 2 diabetes who are expected to be treated with GLP-1 therapeutics to manage their diabetes.

In June 2018, we acquired exclusive global development and commercialization rights to EFX from Amgen Inc., or Amgen, which leveraged its deep protein engineering expertise to design and develop EFX. As of February 14, 2024, our patent portfolio relating to EFX and other peptides included 209 issued patents and 17 pending patent applications worldwide, with expected patent exclusivity up to 2034 in the United States, including potential patent term extension. Recently filed patent applications, if granted, may extend patent exclusivity to 2045. Since EFX is a biologic, marketing approval would also provide twelve years of market exclusivity from the approval date of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the United States.

Our management team has extensive experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, and has been involved in the approvals of more than 20 medicines. Our Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD, was formerly Chief Medical Officer at Gilead, and responsible for clinical development for Gilead's HIV program. Our Chief Development Officer, Kitty Yale, led global clinical operations and management of Gilead’s oncology, HIV, inflammation and liver disease trials. Our Chief Scientific Officer, Tim Rolph, DPhil, was formerly Chief Scientific

Officer of Pfizer's Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease Research Unit, and oversaw Pfizer's FGF21 program. Our Chief Technical Officer, Scott Gangloff, led global biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing of Incyte’s biologics portfolio. We believe that our team is well positioned to leverage its collective experience in drug development and in-depth knowledge of FGF21 biology and metabolic diseases to develop and commercialize products that will have significant benefits for patients with MASH and other serious metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to become a leading biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative treatments for serious metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need, with an initial focus on MASH. The key components of our strategy are to:

Advance EFX through clinical development for both compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and pre-cirrhotic (F2-F3) MASH. 
We believe that EFX has the potential to be an important medicine, if approved, for the treatment of MASH. Data from our Phase 2b SYMMETRY and HARMONY studies suggest that EFX has the potential to reverse compensated cirrhosis and reverse moderate to advanced fibrosis, as well as improve non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis and liver injury, insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein profile. We are committed to accelerating development as much as possible for patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3), consistent with guidance from regulatory authorities.

Scale our capabilities to support development and commercialization of EFX.
 We are scaling our manufacturing and organizational capabilities to capitalize on our exclusive, global rights to market EFX. We have successfully manufactured drug substance at Boehringer Ingelheim and a new drug product-device combination at Vetter Pharma, which is currently being used for patient self-administration in the Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program. When appropriate, we intend to develop the commercial infrastructure required for bringing EFX to patients with MASH in the United States, if approved. We also plan to evaluate options, including potential strategic collaborations, for delivering EFX, if approved, to patients in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China.

Leverage our knowledge of FGF21 biology to bring EFX to additional patients with metabolic diseases.
 Numerous publications have shown that increases in endogenous FGF21 expression occur in response to various types of metabolic and cellular stress arising from obesity, diabetes, mitochondrial diseases and cardiovascular disease, as well as MASH. EFX has been engineered to reproduce the biological activity profile of native FGF21 while also addressing certain therapeutic limitations, such as a short half-life. We are exploring opportunities to develop EFX for additional indications where there is a compelling scientific rationale, strong clinical tractability and significant unmet medical need.

Enhance our position as a leading metabolic disease company by developing, acquiring or in-licensing additional investigational product candidates.
 We are continually evaluating opportunities to build a robust pipeline of potential leading treatments for serious metabolic diseases. We may select additional assets for their potential as stand-alone monotherapies or for eventual use in combination with other products.

Our Pipeline

Our pipeline is anchored by EFX, a potential treatment for MASH. We have one EFX program focused on patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3) and a second EFX program focused on patients with compensated cirrhosis due to MASH (F4).

MASH Overview

MASH is a severe form of MASLD, which is driven by the global obesity epidemic. Patients with MASLD have an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver resulting from an excess of caloric intake over energy needs. In patients with MASH, excessive liver fat leads to hepatocyte stress, which triggers localized inflammation and can cause extensive scarring, or fibrosis, as the liver attempts to repair and replace damaged cells.

Patients with MASH are at increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, including liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. As MASH progresses, cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality also increase, with

cardiovascular disease being the most frequent cause of death among patients with MASH. The prevalence of patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (F2-F4) in the United States is projected to rise to 14.1 million by 2030, representing a roughly 100% increase from an estimated 6.7 million in 2016.

Diagnosis and disease burden

In clinical practice, MASH is generally diagnosed and treated using non-invasive tests. Within clinical trials to meet regulatory requirements, MASH is diagnosed through liver biopsy and its severity is measured using scoring systems that assess the extent and severity of steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning and fibrosis. Although noninvasive tests, including a combination of imaging, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Protein Density Fat Fraction, or, MRI-PDFF, and Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography, or FibroScan, and plasma biomarkers of fibrosis, such as Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score, are being used in clinical practice, none have yet been validated for use in clinical trials to support marketing approval.

Two different scoring systems are most commonly used in United States clinical trials to measure the severity of MASH: the NAFLD activity score, or NAS, and fibrosis stage. The NAS, which was specifically developed for, and generally only used in, clinical trials, is a measure of liver histology that grades disease activity in patients with MASLD or MASH. A patient may receive a composite NAS score of 0-8, which is comprised of three individual scores: (1) steatosis, scored 0-3 according to the percentage of a microscopic field showing steatosis, (2) lobular inflammation, scored 0-3 according to the number of immune cell foci per optical field at 20-fold magnification, and (3) hepatocellular ballooning, scored 0-2 according to the number of ballooning cells in a microscopic field. In addition, staging is used to classify the extent and severity of fibrosis with a scoring system based on a scale from 0-4, or F0-F4. Early, discrete fibrosis is classified as F1 or F2, whereas bridging fibrosis is classified as F3. As more hepatocytes die and scarring becomes extensive, the liver becomes cirrhotic, which is classified as stage F4.

Patients with MASH are at increased risk of liver damage and other complications. Pre-cirrhotic fibrosis is generally reversible. Prior to reporting of the preliminary topline week 96 results from our Phase 2b SYMMETRY study in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH, cirrhosis had generally been viewed as irreversible.

MASH is commonly associated with metabolic comorbidities, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia, and with hypertension. In addition, the majority of patients with MASH also present with metabolic syndrome. As shown in the figure below, which is based on a pooled meta-analysis of multinational clinical trial data published in Hepatology (2017), liver-related mortality increases with fibrosis stage. As compared to healthy individuals, patients with MASH also experience higher all-cause morbidity and mortality resulting from major adverse cardiovascular events, and non-liver cancers. The most common cause of death in patients with MASH is cardiovascular disease. As with liver-related mortality, all-cause mortality also increases with fibrosis stage. Our focus is on patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) and pre-cirrhotic moderate to advanced fibrosis (F2-F3).

MASH Mortality Rates by Fibrosis Stage

Table of Contents

Patients with cirrhosis due to MASH face a particularly poor prognosis. In the chart below, the overall 5-year survival rate without a liver transplant amongst F4 patients is about 50 percent. Patients with compensated cirrhosis are at risk of decompensation or liver failure. Liver failure manifests as clinical events such as fluid buildup in the abdomen known as ascites, presence of enlarged esophageal veins known as varices, and impaired brain function known as hepatic encephalopathy. We believe a therapeutic treatment option that reverses cirrhosis due to MASH would represent a major medical advance with the potential to meaningfully improve outcomes and transform patients’ lives.

High Risk of Mortality Associated with Cirrhosis Due to MASH

Market size and trends

According to studies published in Hepatology (2018) and F1000Research (2018), more than one billion people worldwide were estimated to have MASLD in 2016, including an estimated 85 million individuals in the United States. Approximately 10-20% of patients with MASLD progress to MASH, including an estimated 17.3 million individuals in the United States and 16.4 million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan in 2016. As the global population ages, the prevalence of MASH is projected to increase approximately 50% by 2030 to a total of 27.0 million individuals in the United States and 22.5 million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan. However, MASH afflicts all age groups, including teenagers and young adults, for whom the loss of quality-adjusted life years will be substantial unless progression to late-stage diseases can be halted or reversed. According to a study published in Hepatology (2016), in the absence of approved therapies, direct healthcare costs associated with MASLD and MASH in the United States were estimated to be approximately $100 billion in 2016.

Growth in prevalence of MASH in the United States is projected to be greatest in patients with stage F2-F4 fibrosis, with more than a doubling across these stages between 2016 and 2030 and higher growth rates with each advancing fibrosis stage. More than 14 million Americans are projected to have MASH with F2, F3 or F4 fibrosis in the United States by 2030, with over ten million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan. This rapid growth in advanced fibrosis reflects the obesity epidemic that developed in the late 20th century, with patients progressing through MASLD to advanced MASH over the last 20-30 years.

An estimated 3 million Americans are projected to have cirrhosis due to MASH by 2030. Cirrhosis due to MASH is the fastest growing cause of liver transplants and liver cancer in the United States and Europe.

Marketed and investigational therapies in development

In March 2024, the FDA approved the first therapy for treatment of adults with noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis). This product, marketed under the brand name Rezdiffra
TM
, is a selective agonist of thyroid hormone receptor-β and appears to act primarily by regulating fat metabolism in the liver, thereby addressing the underlying disease driver of MASH. There currently are no approved therapies for treatment of compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH.

The multistep progression of MASH pathogenesis offers a variety of potential approaches for therapeutic intervention and many of these approaches continue to be explored with one or more therapeutic candidates. Many MASH therapeutic candidates have had discouraging clinical trial results due to unfavorable efficacy and/or safety results, with a substantial number of programs discontinued. Disappointing clinical results have especially been associated with therapeutic candidates designed to target late-stage disease by mitigating inflammation and reversing fibrosis, which have been labeled as “anti-fibrotic” mechanisms. Available data suggest that focusing only on suppressing inflammation and fibrosis is unlikely to deliver sustained reversal of fibrosis or resolution of MASH because the processes underlying MASH pathogenesis are not being addressed.

We believe the greatest potential for effective MASH treatment requires addressing both the late-stage fibrosis and the underlying processes of MASH pathogenesis, combined with a favorable cardiovascular profile and minimal potential for drug-drug interactions associated with small molecules. Some MASH candidates are being evaluated for use in combination with one or more other investigational or marketed drugs to intervene at different stages of MASH pathogenesis and manage unwanted side effects. However, combining multiple interventions, particularly multiple small molecules, places an additional burden of drug metabolism and clearance upon already stressed hepatocytes.

We believe EFX has the potential to address the complex pathogenesis of MASH as a foundational monotherapy: reducing liver fat, restoring metabolic balance, and reversing cirrhosis as well as fibrosis while simultaneously improving multiple independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, without worsening MASH pathogenesis.

Harnessing FGF21’s Natural Metabolic and Anti-Fibrotic Effects

EFX harnesses the natural properties of FGF21 as a potential treatment for MASH. Specifically, EFX has been engineered to overcome the limitations of endogenous FGF21 by extending half-life from less than two hours to approximately 3 days while maintaining FGF21’s natural role in alleviating cellular stress and regulating whole-body metabolism. Consequently, EFX has the potential to address the underlying metabolic disease drivers of MASH while also reversing liver fibrosis. We believe EFX has the potential to be the leading FGF21 analog that most closely mimics the native protein with a half-life that supports convenient weekly dosing.

Overview of FGF21 biology

Fibroblast growth factors, or FGFs, are a large family of cell-signaling proteins involved in the regulation of many processes within the body. FGF21 is part of a sub-family known as endocrine FGFs, which are unique among FGFs because they initiate their biological effects by binding tightly to a cell surface receptor known as Beta Klotho, or 

Klotho. After this initial binding, FGF21 triggers signaling pathways within cells, such as hepatocytes and adipocytes, by binding to a second class of cell-surface receptor, known as the FGF receptors, or FGFRs. FGF21 binds to three specific FGFRs, known as FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c. Once a co-receptor complex has formed with 

Klotho and one of the FGFRs, a series of intracellular signaling cascades is initiated. These signaling cascades enable FGF21 to exert its biological functions, which include regulation of energy homeostasis, glucose-lipid-protein metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and modulation of pathways that mitigate against intracellular stress. FGF21 cannot signal through cell membranes without both an intact C-terminus and an intact N-terminus to bind, respectively, to 

Klotho and FGFR. We believe EFX has been engineered to maximize binding at both the C-terminus and N-terminus, which distinguishes EFX from other FGF21 analogs.

EFX is designed to overcome the limitations of native FGF21 as a therapeutic

EFX has been engineered to retain balanced agonism across FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c. Specifically, EFX delivers: (1) protection against proteolysis and reduced renal clearance, (2) a half-life of approximately 3 days, (3) lower susceptibility to aggregation in solution and (4) enhanced binding affinity for 

Klotho. These attributes are accomplished through a combinataion of three amino acid substitutions in the FGF21 protein sequence and fusion to a human IgG1 Fc-domain similar to the platform used for Enbrel and Trulicity. As illustrated in the figure below, each EFX molecule consists of two Fc-FGF21 molecules linked by two disulfide bridges. The N-terminus of the FGF21 moiety is connected to the Fc portion of EFX through a polyglycine-serine linker. Our patents include claims directed to Fc fusion with a recombinantly modified FGF21 as well as claims directed to an FGF21 polypeptide comprising combinations of point mutations at positions 98, 171 and 180 of mature human FGF21. Pharmacokinetic modeling based on analysis of intact, active EFX in human serum after weekly administration of EFX for 16-24 weeks in the Phase 2a BALANCED and Phase 2b HARMONY studies indicates steady-state exposure is attained between weeks 4 and 8. More than a two-fold increase in exposure to EFX is observed for 50mg relative to 28mg despite a less-than-two-fold increase in dose. 
Subsequent analysis of SYMMETRY data indicates a similar relationship.

Protein engineering of EFX

Based on recent in vitro analysis as well as the robust results of clinical trials evaluating EFX, we believe the bivalent structure of EFX, with two FGF21 monomers covalently linked via the disulfide bridges of the Fc fragment, may confer a longer duration of pharmacological activity relative to analogs of FGF21 based on single chain configurations. The bivalent configuration of EFX was associated with a 100-fold greater affinity of EFX for 

Klotho than corresponding single chain configurations.

EFX maintains balanced agonism of FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c to mimic native FGF21

EFX was designed through an empirical process that incorporated in vitro and in vivo measurements of receptor agonism to assess which of many tested discovery candidates yielded the most attractive drug properties. EFX was selected for clinical evaluation over other potential candidates, which included a proprietary PEGylated FGF21 analog and two versions of a two-point mutation Fc-fusion protein known as RG (with mutations at positions 98 and 171, but not 180), one of which had the Fc fused to the C-terminus while the other had it fused to the N-terminus of the modified FGF21. Among the candidates tested, in vitro assays showed EFX to be the most potent agonist for each of FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c with potency comparable to recombinantly expressed human FGF21.

In vitro receptor agonism assays based on recombinant cell lines expressing human receptors do not necessarily predict in vivo pharmacological activity in humans. Because distribution of FGF21's receptors is tissue-dependent, the in vivo activity of EFX against different receptors can be evaluated in clinical studies using tissue-specific markers. For example, activation of FGFR1c expressed in adipose tissue results in secretion of adiponectin and higher serum adiponectin levels. Likewise, activation of FGFR2c, which appears to be the most highly expressed FGF21 receptor in the liver, appears to be associated with reduced secretion of apolipoprotein-B, or Apo-B. On a placebo-adjusted basis among patients treated with 50mg EFX, across 5 clinical trials of 12- 96 weeks in duration, levels of adiponectin increased by more than 50% and Apo-B decreased by 10-20%.

Table of Contents

The effects observed in clinical trials with EFX contrast with observations from clinical trials evaluating certain pegylated or glycopegylated FGF21 analogs, which we believe may be attributed to the potential for pegylated proteins to accumulate in the liver. For example, each of two pegylated FGF21 analogs for which results have been reported publicly have shown smaller reductions in triglycerides (which are largely carried on Apo-B-containing particles) and smaller increases in adiponectin than reported for 50mg EFX. We believe the unique and proprietary engineering of EFX, including its targeted amino acid substitutions and Fc fusion scaffold, as described above, may be responsible for the differentiated clinical effects observed after treatment with EFX compared with other pegylated FGF21 analogs.

EFX exerts both metabolic and anti-fibrotic effects

We believe intervening across the core processes underlying MASH pathogenesis is the most effective way to restore health to the liver and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with MASH, which is the leading contributor to mortality and morbidity. By mimicking FGF21, EFX has the potential to intervene in each of the core processes underlying MASH pathogenesis, acting as both a metabolic and anti-fibrotic therapeutic agent. EFX acts to leverage whole-body metabolism to redirect calories away from the liver to peripheral tissues, including adipose tissue, thereby reducing fat deposited in the liver and ultimately decreasing the rate of fat oxidation by the liver. Through this activity, EFX reduces fibrosis both indirectly, as a result of alleviating hepatocyte stress, and directly, by suppressing local inflammation and activation of collagen-secreting myofibroblasts that lay down fibrotic tissue.

Phase 3 Evaluation of EFX

Enrollment for a multi-trial, global Phase 3 program called SYNCHRONY began in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program consists of three randomized, placebo-controlled trials: SYNCHRONY 
Outcomes
, SYNCHRONY 
Histology
, and SYNCHRONY 
Real-World
. The comprehensive SYNCHRONY program (N ~3,500) builds on two biopsy-based Phase 2b studies (N ~300) in corresponding patient populations.

SYNCHRONY 
Outcomes 
is a two-cohort trial evaluating treatment with EFX in approximately 1,150 patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4), Child-Pugh Class A, due to MASH. Patients are receiving weekly injections of either EFX 50mg or placebo. The primary histology endpoint, for Cohort 1 only, is the proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis and no worsening of steatohepatitis after 96 weeks of treatment. The primary outcomes endpoint for all patients enrolled across Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 is the time from randomization to first occurrence of any protocol-specified clinical event.

SYNCHRONY 
Histology 
is a two-cohort trial evaluating EFX in the treatment of approximately 1,650 patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH, fibrosis stage 2 or 3 (F2-F3). Patients are receiving weekly injections of 28mg EFX, 50mg EFX, or placebo. The primary histology endpoint, for Cohort 1 only, to support an application for accelerated approval, is the proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 1-stage fibrosis improvement and resolution of MASH after 52 weeks of treatment. All patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be evaluated for long-term clinical outcomes for up to 240 weeks of treatment. Results for the 52-week primary histology endpoint from the SYNCHRONY 
Histology 
trial are expected in the first half of 2027.

SYNCHRONY 
Real-World 
is evaluating EFX in the treatment of approximately 700 patients with fibrosis stages 1 through 4, compensated (F1-F4, compensated), including up to 100 patients in an open-label rollover of placebo patients from the Phase 2b HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies who are being treated with 50mg EFX. The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability is being assessed after 52 weeks of treatment. Enrollment of the double-blind portion of SYNCHRONY 
Real-World
 (N=601) was completed in January 2025. Results from the SYNCHRONY Real-World trial are expected in the first half of 2026.

In all EFX Phase 3 studies, patients are self-administering EFX using the LyoJect 3S dual chamber syringe, a pre-filled device intended for commercial use in the event EFX is approved for marketing. This optimized formulation delivers blood levels of EFX comparable to those of the liquid formulation used in prior clinical studies.

Phase 2b Evaluation of EFX

Our Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program evaluating EFX for treatment of pre-cirrhotic and cirrhotic MASH builds on the results of two separate 96-week Phase 2b studies, the SYMMETRY study in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH and the HARMONY study in patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3).

Biopsy Analysis in Phase 2b HARMONY and SYMMETRY Studies

Consistent with FDA recommendations, the HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies evaluate all biopsies using consensus readers. Two independent and cross-trained pathologists score each biopsy for NAS score and fibrosis stage. If there are any differences on any component of pathology scoring, the two pathologists determine if consensus can be reached. In the absence of consensus, a third pathologist would adjudicate between the first two pathologists’ scores. Adjudication by a third pathologist was not required because the two principal pathologists achieved consensus on interpretation of all week 24 and week 96 HARMONY and SYMMETRY biopsy samples.

Table of Contents

Per applicable FDA guidance regarding endpoints recommended for use in Phase 3 clinical trials, the HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies’ primary and key secondary histology endpoints were defined as:

•
Proportion of subjects who achieve improvement in liver fibrosis greater than or equal to one stage (MASH CRN fibrosis score) and no worsening of steatohepatitis (defined as no increase in NAS for ballooning, inflammation, or steatosis)

•
Proportion of subjects who achieve resolution of steatohepatitis (defined as a NAS score of 0–1 for inflammation, 0 for ballooning, and any value for steatosis) and no worsening of liver fibrosis on MASH CRN fibrosis score. 

•
Proportion of subjects who achieve improvement in liver fibrosis greater than or equal to one stage and no worsening of steatohepatitis (as defined above).

EFX for Treatment of Compensated Cirrhosis Due to MASH (F4)

Compensated cirrhosis due to MASH (F4) represents a high unmet medical need. Approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis die within 5 years of diagnosis, absent a liver transplant. The risk of liver-related clinical events such as hospitalization for acute or chronic liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as cardiovascular events, is substantially higher for patients with cirrhosis. The FDA has issued draft guidance specific to the development of investigational therapies for patients with cirrhosis due to MASH, who are projected to number more than 3 million patients in the United States by 2030. According to the FDA, the treatment goal for cirrhotic patients is to halt disease progression, thereby preventing clinical decompensation, reducing the incidence of liver transplantation, and improving survival. Published FDA guidance states that long-term clinical outcomes data obtained in Phase 3 trials is required for marketing approval of investigational drugs indicated for treatment of compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH.

A 2020 analysis of pooled data from the STELLAR 4 trial showed reversal of cirrhosis was associated with an 80% reduction in risk of liver-related clinical events, emphasizing the medical benefit to be gained for a therapy that could reverse cirrhosis. Unfortunately, treatments capable of effectively treating cirrhosis due to MASH have proven elusive to date.  No compound other than EFX has been shown in clinical trials to statistically significantly reverse cirrhosis.

Phase 2b clinical trial of EFX in patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH

The Phase 2b SYMMETRY study was a 96-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial in biopsy-confirmed adult patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH. One hundred eighty-two patients were randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous dosing of 28mg or 50mg EFX, or placebo. The study incorporated two timepoints for histological evaluation, at weeks 36 and 96. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of MASH at week 36. Key secondary endpoints included fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH and MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis at week 96 and change from baseline in noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis and liver injury, insulin sensitivity, and lipoproteins at 36 and 96 weeks, as well as measures of safety and tolerability.

Phase 2b SYMMETRY Study Design

50mg EFX achieved statistical significance over placebo on the secondary histology endpoint of fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH after 96 weeks of treatment whether by both completer or ITT analyses

The SYMMETRY trial showed a numerical trend but not statistical significance on the primary endpoint of ≥1 stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of MASH after 36 weeks of treatment, with 24% and 22% for the 50mg and 28mg EFX dose groups, compared to 14% for the placebo arm. After 96 weeks of treatment, as shown in the chart below, ≥1 stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of MASH was observed in 39% (p=0.009) of patients in the 50mg dose group, compared to only 15 percent for placebo. The 29% response rate for the 28mg EFX group was not significant. Statistical significance for the 50mg EFX group was maintained under ITT analysis, with 29% (p=0.031) of patients achieving cirrhosis reversal without worsening of MASH, compared to 12 percent for placebo. Under the conservative approach employed in this ITT analysis, all missing biopsies were treated as failures, as typically used by regulatory authorities. We believe the statistically significant results observed for 50mg EFX after 96 weeks reflected the benefit of longer treatment with EFX, as the numerical trend toward improvement for 50mg EFX at week 36 (24% versus 14% for placebo) improved to statistically significant results with larger magnitudes of treatment effect relative to placebo at week 96 compared to week 36. Given the clear dose-related response, with improvement in fibrosis only statistically significant for 50mg by either completer or ITT analysis, we believe the greater therapeutic activity of 50mg than 28mg is required to achieve reversal of cirrhosis.

GLP-1 use at baseline did not impact reversal of cirrhosis by EFX

Analysis of a subgroup of a patients who were reported not to be taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist at baseline (N=97) showed that use of GLP-1 therapy did not impact cirrhosis reversal. The response rate among a subgroup of patients treated with 50mg EFX who were not taking a GLP-1 at baseline was 45% (p=0.009), compared to 17% for placebo. This suggests that reversal of cirrhosis by EFX does not depend on co-administration with GLP-1 therapy.

50mg EFX significantly improved noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis

Treatment with EFX significantly improved two important noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis: ELF and liver stiffness. As shown in the table below, highly significant absolute reductions in ELF of 0.53 (p<0.001) and 0.34 (p<0.001) were observed for 50mg and 28mg EFX, respectively, compared with an increase of 0.22 for placebo. Only the 50mg EFX group was observed to statistically significantly reduce liver stiffness: 24% (p=0.028) compared to an 8%

reduction for placebo. The extent of reduction observed in ELF and liver stiffness for the 50mg EFX group have been shown in prior studies to be associated with reduced progression to end-stage liver disease. In addition, the mean absolute change in liver stiffness for patients treated with 50mg EFX was a reduction of 7.3 kPa, compared to reductions of 6.5 kPa and 5.0 kPa for 28mg EFX and placebo, respectively. We believe the absolute reduction of 7.3 kPa is the largest absolute reduction in liver stiffness reported to date among patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4) due to MASH.

Additional analysis of liver stiffness showed that 70% of patients treated with 50mg EFX (CMH test p=0.017, versus placebo) experienced at least a 25% relative reduction in liver stiffness, compared to 61% and 47% for 28mg EFX and placebo, respectively.

EFX improved markers of liver injury

Levels of ALT and AST were statistically significantly reduced by week 8 for patients treated with 50mg EFX, with reductions largely sustained throughout the 96-week treatment duration.

50mg EFX improved lipoprotein profile and insulin sensitivity

As summarized in the table below, treatment with EFX was associated with statistically significant improvements in measures of lipoprotein profile and insulin sensitivity. We believe a more healthy whole-body metabolic profile is important to establishing an environment conducive to hepatocytes regaining functional capacity as cirrhosis is reversed.

EFX was generally well-tolerated in the SYMMETRY study

EFX was generally well-tolerated in the SYMMETRY study. There were no deaths with EFX treatment, but one death prior to week 36 occurred in a placebo patient who developed pneumonia. There were 41 serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported over the full 96 weeks of treatment. None of the SAEs were determined to be drug-related by the clinical investigators. The reported SAEs generally reflect the advanced disease status of these patients carrying multiple comorbidities. A total of 19 patients were discontinued due to treatment-emergent AEs (two in placebo, six in the 28mg group and 11 in the 50mg group). Only three of these discontinuations occurred from weeks 37 to 96. Two of these discontinuations were due to cirrhosis-related disease progression: ascites (28mg EFX group) and hepatic encephalopathy (50mg EFX group). The one additional discontinuation from weeks 37 to 96 was due to diarrhea (50mg EFX group). The most frequent adverse events were mainly transient, mild to moderate diarrhea and nausea.

Forty-three percent and 41% of 50mg EFX and placebo patients, respectively, had osteopenia at baseline, but only 3% and 7%, respectively, were treated with bisphosphonates. Against this backdrop, bone mineral density, adjusted for placebo, declined to a small but significant extent for the 50mg EFX group: 5% for the lumbar spine and femoral neck (hip) regions over 96 weeks of treatment, or 2-3% per year. For context, treatment with a diabetic dose of GLP-1 was recently reported to be associated with about a 2% reduction in bone mineral density over one year. Importantly, after nearly two years of EFX treatment, there was an equal number of fractures in the 50mg and placebo groups. Overall, we consider these effects to be mild and manageable. Accordingly, we are monitoring for bone health at entry into our Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program and ensuring adherence to a consistent standard of care.

There were no statistically significant changes observed for ECGs, heart rate or blood pressure for the 50mg EFX group at week 96. Reductions of about 2% in body weight were observed for both the 50mg EFX and placebo groups. Markers of liver function and hemostasis, including bilirubin, MELD score, INR, platelet count, albumin and Child-Pugh score remained stable or trended toward slight improvement for the 50mg EFX group.

Phase 2b HARMONY Study in Patients with Pre-Cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3)

The Phase 2b HARMONY study was a 96-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial in biopsy-confirmed adult patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3). The study enrolled a total of 128 patients, randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous dosing of 28mg or 50mg EFX or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of MASH at week 24. Key secondary histology endpoints included MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and a composite endpoint of both MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement at weeks 24 and 96, as well as fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH at week 96. Additional secondary measures included change from baseline in liver fat, markers of livery injury, noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, glycemic control, lipoproteins, and body weight at 24 and 96 weeks as well as safety and tolerability measures.

Phase 2b HARMONY Study Design

The 50mg EFX group achieved statistical significance on primary and secondary histology endpoints

The HARMONY study met its primary endpoint for both the 50mg and 28mg EFX dose groups, with 41% and 39% of EFX-treated patients, respectively, experiencing at least a one-stage improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of MASH at week 24, compared with 20% for the placebo arm. Substantially greater improvements were observed at week 96 for 50mg than 28mg EFX, with the response rate increasing from 41% to 75% (p<0.001) for 50mg EFX compared to 24% for placebo. Although the response rate increased for 28mg EFX from 39% to 46%, the result was not statistically significantly different from placebo.

The study also met additional histology endpoints at week 96. Notably, 36% (p<0.001) and 31% (p=0.002) of patients treated with 50mg EFX and 28mg EFX experienced a 2-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of MASH—which was more than 10-fold the placebo rate of 3%.

The placebo-adjusted effect size on fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH (EFX response rate minus placebo response rate) more than doubled between week 24 and week 96 for the 50mg EFX group, with a slight increase observed for the 28mg EFX group. Specifically, the placebo-adjusted effect sizes for fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH grew from 21% to 52% between week 24 and week 96 for 50mg EFX and from 20% to 22% for 28mg EFX. Highly statistically significant results for 50mg EFX at week 96 are notable because (1) the study was not fully powered at week 96 and (2) the placebo rate increased rather than decreased. An increase in treatment rate for placebo means that the increases in effect size are attributable to higher EFX treatment responses rather than a decline in placebo rate.

Analysis of the evolution of responses between weeks 24 and 96 indicated not only broadening fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH but also sustained response, particularly following treatment with 50mg EFX. Among those patients with available week 96 biopsies whose fibrosis improved at week 24, 92% and 83% of the 50mg and 28mg EFX groups remained responders, respectively, compared to 40% for placebo. In addition, among patients with available week 96 biopsies who were not fibrosis responders at week 24, 63% of 50mg EFX patients were responders at week 96, compared with 14% and 21% for 28mg EFX and placebo, respectively.

Analysis of a subset of patients with baseline F3 fibrosis who had week 96 biopsies showed EFX’s potential to treat patients with more advanced fibrosis, who are generally considered to be at higher risk of progression to cirrhosis. For this advanced F3 patient population, 68% (p<0.001) and 40% of the 50mg and 28mg EFX groups, respectively, experienced at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of MASH, compared to 14% for placebo.

EFX significantly improved noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis and liver injury

Treatment with EFX significantly improved three important noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis, Pro-C3, ELF and liver stiffness. As shown in the table below, significant absolute reductions in ELF of 0.8 and 0.7 were observed for 50mg and 28mg EFX, respectively, compared with a 0.1 decrease for placebo. Statistically significant reductions of -7.2 and -4.0 in liver stiffness were also observed for the 50mg and 28mg EFX groups, respectively, compared with a 0.6 reduction for placebo. The levels of reduction observed for ELF and liver stiffness for the 50mg EFX group have been associated in prior studies with reduced progression to end-stage liver disease. Only the 50mg EFX group was observed to have a statistically significant improvement in Pro-C3. Both EFX groups were observed to significantly reduce ALT and AST, two noninvasive measures of liver injury.

Overlap of imaging and circulating biomarkers of fibrosis corroborate conventional histopathology observations

The Venn diagrams below present an analysis of the degree of overlap (congruence) for two non-invasive measures of liver fibrosis: liver stiffness and ELF score, with each other and with improvement in fibrosis by conventional histopathology for each of placebo, 28mg and 50mg EFX groups. The areas shown for each dose group correspond to the proportion (%) of responders for each of the parameters. For liver stiffness, patients are responders if they show at least a 30% reduction by Fibroscan. For ELF, patients are responders if their ELF score decreases by at least 0.5. For conventional histopathology, patients are responders if they show at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of MASH.

A clear dose -response is evident by this analysis, with 0% of placebo patients meeting the overlapping response definitions combining liver stiffness, ELF and fibrosis improvement, compared with 19% and 42% for 28mg and 50mg EFX. An inverse dose-response is evident for the proportion of patients who did not meet the responder definition for any of the parameters: 47% for placebo compared with 19% and 0% for 28mg and 50mg EFX groups, respectively. The relative absence of overlapping response for placebo suggests that a substantial proportion of the fibrosis improvement observed for placebo by conventional histopathology is due to variability in tissue sampling. By contrast, the comparatively high congruence between conventional histopathology and noninvasive fibrosis markers observed in the EFX groups, particularly for 50mg EFX, reflects a substantial degree of fibrosis regression that cannot be attributed simply to variability in tissue sampling.

50mg EFX statistically significantly improved lipoprotein profile and insulin sensitivity

As summarized in the table below, treatment with EFX was associated with statistically significant improvements in measures of lipoprotein profile and insulin sensitivity. We believe a more healthy whole-body metabolic profile is important to establishing an environment conducive to hepatocytes regaining functional capacity as fibrosis regresses in the liver of patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH (F2-F3).

EFX was generally well-tolerated in the HARMONY study

EFX was reported to be generally well-tolerated. There were no deaths. Fifteen serious adverse events were reported, which were generally balanced across dose groups. Across both EFX groups, the most frequent adverse events, or AEs, were grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, nausea, and increased appetite), which were transient in nature. A total of three patients treated with EFX discontinued due to AEs between week 24 and week 96 (two in the 28mg group and one in the 50mg group), compared with none for placebo.

Evaluation of EFX in combination with GLP-1 therapy in patients with pre-cirrhotic MASH

The Phase 2b SYMMETRY study included an expansion cohort, known as Cohort D, evaluating administration of EFX to patients with type 2 diabetes who are already being treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist, or GLP-1, therapy. Approximately two-thirds of patients with F2 or F3 MASH, and roughly three-quarters of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to MASH, also have type 2 diabetes. Given the increasing use of GLP-1 for treatment of patients, we expect that many patients who could be eligible for treatment with EFX, if approved, may receive GLP-1 therapy. Cohort D was designed to assess whether EFX could be added in patients with MASH who are already being treated with GLP-1 for type 2 diabetes.

Cohort D enrolled a total of 32 patients with type 2 diabetes and F1-F3 liver fibrosis due to MASH. Approximately two-thirds of randomized patients were on a stable dose of GLP-1 for more than one year; all patients were on a stable dose for at least three months.

The study met the primary endpoint, with the safety and tolerability of EFX dosed to patients in combination with a GLP-1 therapy broadly comparable to that of placebo-treated patients receiving a GLP-1 therapy alone. There were no deaths in the study. No patients were reported to have a drug-related SAE. One patient discontinued due to nausea related to treatment with EFX. Consistent with previous evaluations of EFX, gastrointestinal events were the most frequent AEs. The overall tolerability profile was similar observations with EFX in other Phase 2 studies. Diarrhea was slightly more frequent in the GLP-1 alone group than the EFX combined with GLP-1 group, while nausea was slightly more frequent in the combined group than for GLP-1 alone. While both treatment groups reported decreased appetite, more EFX-treated patients reported increased appetite. However, a mean reduction in body weight was observed for EFX-treated patients despite reports of increased appetite. No new safety signals were evident.

In addition, on key non-invasive measures of liver injury and fibrosis, EFX combined with GLP-1 therapy was more effective than GLP-1 alone, in most cases with statistical significance despite the modest study size. Likewise, glycemic control and lipid profiles were improved more by the combination of EFX with GLP-1 than GLP-1 alone.

The tables below summarize multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints.

As initial consideration for the license, we paid Amgen an upfront payment of $5.0 million and also issued 2,653,333 shares of our Series A preferred stock to Amgen at the time of the initial closing in June 2018 with a subsequent 3,205,128 shares of our Series A preferred stock issued at the time of the second closing in November 2018, representing 10% of total shares outstanding at such times. In August 2019 we made an additional payment of $2.5 million in connection with dosing the first patient in our Phase 2a clinical trial, which was the first development milestone under the license agreement. In December 2023, we paid Amgen $7.5 million in connection with dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program. As additional consideration for the license, we are obligated to pay Amgen up to $30.0 million in connection with marketing approvals, and aggregate milestone payments of up to $75.0 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones for all products licensed under the Amgen Agreement. No commercial milestones have been achieved to date under the license agreement. We are also required to pay tiered royalties of low to high single-digit percentages on annual net sales of the products covered by the license. The royalty rate with respect to the net sales is subject to customary reductions, including in the event that the exploitation of a Product is not covered by a valid claim with the licensed patent rights. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.

The license agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Products in the territory. Upon expiration of the license agreement, the licenses granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable and non-exclusive. Either we or Amgen may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days (or 30 days in the case of failure to make any payment as and when due under the agreement) after written notice is provided or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up. Amgen shall have the right to terminate

the license agreement in full upon written notice to us in the event we, our affiliates or sublicensees, directly challenge the patentability, enforceability or validity of any licensed patents, unless, in the event of a sublicensee challenge, we terminate the sublicense within 60 days’ notice. We shall have the right to terminate the license agreement within 90 days written notice to Amgen if we conclude, due to scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial reasons, that the exploitation of the Products is no longer commercially practicable.

Intellectual property

Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of making and methods of use, including combination therapies. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through claims covering additional methods of use and biomarkers and complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic related claims. As of February 14, 2024, we have licensed from Amgen Inc. approximately 209 issued patents and 14 pending patent applications worldwide. There are currently no pending U.S. provisional patent applications licensed from Amgen.

As of February 14, 2024, our patent portfolio relating to EFX includes 14 issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and issued and pending foreign counterpart patents in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. Nine issued U.S. patents include claims directed to the EFX product, the FGF21 polypeptide component of the EFX product, nucleic acids encoding the product and related polypeptides, polypeptide multimers, related compositions, and methods of using EFX to, e.g., treat diabetes, lower blood glucose in patients suffering from a metabolic disorder, improve glucose tolerance, lower body weight, or reduce triglyceride levels in patients. These issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2029. The pending U.S. patent application and related foreign counterparts are directed to a method of treating a patient with MASH; if issued, the resulting U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2029. We currently anticipate that a composition of matter patent will be eligible for patent term extension to 2034 in the U.S. The portfolio further includes five issued U.S. patents that are directed to related polypeptides and methods of use. International patent applications are pending relating EFX formulations and FGF21 variant multimers. There is a pending U.S. provisional application directed to methods of using EFX to treat liver and lung injury, and a pending U.S. provisional patent application directed to a drug delivery device. A design patent application also has been filed relating to the device.

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For more information, see "Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property."

Manufacturing and supply

We manage several external commercial manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to develop and manufacture EFX.

EFX drug substance, or DS, is manufactured by fermentation of a recombinant strain of the bacterium E. coli. Product accumulates as insoluble particles (inclusion bodies) within the cells and is recovered by cell disruption, followed by solubilization of the inclusion bodies, protein refolding and three chromatographic separation steps to yield

27

Table of Contents

product with target quality attributes. We have an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, to manufacture DS for clinical development and plan in the future to enter into an agreement for commercial supply. Whereas our Phase 2a BALANCED study was supplied by DS acquired by Amgen, our ongoing Phase 3 SYNCHRONY studies are being supplied by DS manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Analysis of the Boehringer Ingelheim GMP DS confirmed it met the same release specification as previously used for Amgen GMP DS and was comparable to Amgen GMP DS across a number of protein characterization studies. Validation of the commercial scale Boehringer Ingelheim DS manufacturing process has been successfully completed.

We have an agreement with Vetter Pharma International GmbH, or Vetter, to manufacture EFX drug product, or DP, for clinical development and plan in the future to enter into an agreement for commercial supply. The GMP DP used for our completed Phase 2b HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies, which was stored as a frozen liquid until immediately before administration to trial subjects, was similar to that for the Phase 2a BALANCED study, which was made from Amgen GMP DS. Analysis of the Vetter Phase 2b GMP DP confirmed that it met the same release specification as previously used for the Phase 2a DP manufactured from Amgen GMP DS.

We are using a lyophilized DP formulation for Phase 3 SYNCHRONY studies and plan to use this formulation as the initial commercial presentation, if EFX is approved. This drug-device combination product, employing Vetter’s Lyo-Ject 3S dual-chamber syringe, was selected for convenient subcutaneous self-administration by patients. Manufacturing of the product-device combination by Vetter for Phase 3 clinical trials has been conducted under GMP conditions. Analysis of the Vetter Phase 3 lyophilized GMP DP confirmed that it met the same release specification as previously used for the Phase 2b frozen DP. A Phase 1 biocomparison study, performed before Phase 3 clinical studies commenced, confirmed that plasma levels of the lyophilized Phase 3 DP were comparable to those of the frozen Phase 2b formulation, following a single subcutaneous dose.

Sales and marketing

Successful marketing of a new drug for the treatment of MASH will require a targeted commercial infrastructure, which . We have begun making plans for commercialization in parallel with our ongoing Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program. We intend to develop the commercial infrastructure required for bringing EFX to patients in the United States, if approved. We also plan to evaluate options for delivering EFX, if approved, to patients in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China, which may include strategic collaborations.

Competition

The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions.

We understand that a number of pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca PLC/MedImmune LLC, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Eisai, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, GSK plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, as well as large and small biotechnology companies such as Aligos Therapeutics, Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Altimmune, Inc., Amgen, Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boston Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,  Cirius Therapeutics, Inc., Corcept Therapeutics, Inc., D&D Pharmatech, Inc., Eccogene Co., Ltd.,  89bio, Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Hanmi Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd., HighTide Therapeutics, Inc., Inventiva Pharma SA, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., North Sea Pharmaceuticals, OrsoBio, Inc., Poxel SA, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sagimet Biosciences, Inc., Sciwind Biosciences Co., Ltd., Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Inc. and Zhejiang Doer Biologics Co. Ltd. are or may be pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target MASH. It is also probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of serious metabolic diseases, such as MASH, will increase. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or

28

Table of Contents

capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.

Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Government Regulation

The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics, medical devices and combinations of biologics and devices, or combination products, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.

U.S. biological product development

In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

•
completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulation;   

•
submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;  

•
approval of a clinical trial protocol and related documentation by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial may be initiated;  

•
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to FDA's regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;  

•
preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for MA that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 

•
satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;  

•
a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;   

•
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product's identity, strength, quality and purity;  

•
potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA in accordance with any applicable expedited programs or designations;  

•
payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and  

29

Table of Contents

•
FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 

Nonclinical and clinical development

Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations and requirements.

Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of the nonclinical tests, including animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within the 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other considerations, unreasonable or significant safety concerns, inability to assess safety concerns, lack of qualified investigators, a misleading or materially incomplete investigator brochure, study design deficiencies, interference with the conduct or completion of a study designed to be adequate and well-controlled for the same or another investigational drug, insufficient quantities of investigational product, lack of effectiveness, or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing a clinical trial to begin, or that, once begun, issues or circumstances will not arise that delay, suspend or terminate such studies.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor's control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain AEs should occur. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its related documentation before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA may accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.

Table of Contents

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

Phase 1—
The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the cases of some products for severe of life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in the targeted patient population.

Phase 2—
The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials.

Phase 3—
The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval or licensure and product labeling.

In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA.

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or 
in vitro
 testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualified for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor's data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

BLA submission and review

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.

31

Table of Contents

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a "filing" decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. Further, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve a product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.

If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

Expedited development and review programs

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for Fast Track designation, new biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request the FDA to designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of Fast Track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted.

Under the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a Breakthrough Therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible.

A product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and has the potential, if approved, to provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA's goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.

Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval (also referred to as Subpart E approval). Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, as demonstrated by a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint, may receive accelerated approval. Specifically, this means that they may be approved on the basis of clinical data establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval, and the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

Pediatric information

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 of Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the

33

pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.

Post-Approval requirements

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors, including those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for ongoing compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. For certain commercial prescription biologic products, manufacturers and other parties involved in the supply chain must also meet chain of distribution requirements and build electronic, interoperable systems for product tracking and tracing and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or other products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

•
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;   

•
fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;  

•
refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;  

•
product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or  

•
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use of their products.

U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent

34

Table of Contents

restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission data of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.

A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, for all formulations, dosage forms, and indications of the biologic. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.

Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.

Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted a 12 year exclusivity period from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. The FDA may approve multiple “first” interchangeable products so long as they are all approved on the same first day of marketing."First licensure" typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the "first licensure" of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.

The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA, and aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have been the subject of litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA continue to evolve.

Regulation of Combination Products in the United States

Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components, biologic components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:

•
a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 

•
two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 

•
a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or 

•
any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 

Under the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA center for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with another FDA center. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.

A combination product with biologic primary mode of action, such as a biologic dispensed in a pre-filled syringe, generally would be reviewed and licensed pursuant to the biologic licensing processes under the PHS Act. In reviewing the BLA application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug or biologics center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product meets applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance.

Following approval of a combination product, each component of a combination product retains its regulatory status (as a biologic or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component.  Accordingly, under FDA regulations, biologic-device combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both biologics and devices, including the cGMP requirements for biologics and the FDA’s Quality System Regulation applicable to medical devices.

Other U.S. healthcare and data privacy laws and compliance requirements

In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse

36

Table of Contents

provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.

Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain MA. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.

Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, as well as the state consumer privacy and health privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) and the Washington My Health My Data Act (the “WA MHMDA”), impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of personal information, individually identifiable health information, and consumer health data. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances. For example, the CCPA and similar consumer privacy laws in a number of states established privacy frameworks for covered businesses, including broad definitions of regulated personal information, data privacy rights for consumers residing in the relevant state, special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and an enforcement framework for violations and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The WA MHMDA applies similar requirements as well as heightened consent requirements for collecting and sharing consumer health data relating to Washington residents, and the law provides aggrieved consumers with a broad private right of action. Many of the state laws differ from each other in significant ways and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA and cover personal information other than protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary's health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer's eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.

In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics

37

Table of Contents

are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.

In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Coverage, pricing and reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors are critical to new product acceptance.

Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that use of a therapeutic is:

•
a covered benefit under its health plan; 

•
safe, effective and medically necessary; 

•
appropriate for the specific patient; 

•
cost-effective; and 

•
neither experimental nor investigational.

38

Table of Contents

We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, or EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Healthcare reform

In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

39

Table of Contents

For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:

•
an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;  

•
an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;  

•
a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70%, the current discount owed as of January 1, 2019 pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA) point-of-sale discounts, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;  

•
extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;  

•
expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;  

•
expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;  

•
a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;  

•
expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;  

•
requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;  

•
a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;   

•
establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and  

•
a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.

Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. However, it is unclear whether the Trump Administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify these executive and administrative actions. President Biden issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. In February 2023, HHS also issued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug pricing model that will test whether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway.

In addition, there have been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that certain drug and biologic manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, former President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the former administration's proposals. In response, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs

40

Table of Contents

and biologicals based on the lowest price manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita.  The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027.  However, in response to a lawsuit filed by several industry groups, on December 28, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining government defendants from implementing the MFN Rule pending completion of notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. On January 13, 2021, in a separate lawsuit brought by industry groups in the U.S. District of Maryland, the government defendants entered a joint motion to stay litigation on the condition that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction granted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and that performance for any final regulation stemming from the MFN Interim Final Rule shall not commence earlier than 60 days after publication of that regulation in the Federal Register. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the MFN Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2026. This deadline was delayed to January 1, 2027 by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 further delayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032. While a number of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, and the Trump Administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers were further reduced starting on January 1, 2025; however, legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would, if enacted, reverse these payment reductions.  In addition to provider payment cuts under Medicare, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 also eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, previously set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. These laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding available for healthcare providers and may otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United

41

Table of Contents

States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Government regulations outside the United States

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products.

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial authorization application must be submitted for each clinical trial to each applicable country's national competent authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Under the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) no 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022, a single application is now made through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, for clinical trial authorization in up to 30 EU/EEA countries at the same time and with a single set of documentation.

The assessment of applications for clinical trials in the EU is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure continues to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State, however overall related timelines are defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The Clinical Trials Regulation also provides for simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Regulation in the European Union

In the EU, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels. To obtain regulatory approval of a medicinal product in the EU, we must submit an MA application. The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with certain exceptions. There are two main types of MA in the EU:

•
The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU, and in the additional countries of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, including medicines produced by biotechnological process, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (i.e. gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days.  Where the CHMP

gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant an MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that an accelerated assessment is no longer appropriate.

•
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State of the EU at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the CMSs raise no objections to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the applicable Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMSs).

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

The EU also provides opportunities for regulatory exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving an MA, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator's preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MA application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the EU until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.

Pediatric development in the Europe Union

In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Paediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products

that are granted an MA on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

PRIME designation

In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the MA application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.

Post-approval controls in the European Union

The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.

All new MA applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.

All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.

Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 in the UK and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.

Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician's employer, his or her

competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.

Regulation of Combination Products

The EU regulates medical devices and medicinal products separately, through different legislative instruments, and the applicable requirements will vary depending on the type of drug-device combination product. EU guidance has been published to help manufacturers select the right regulatory framework. In the case of drug-delivery products intended to administer a medicinal product where the device and the medicinal product do not form a single integral product, the medicinal product is regulated in accordance with the aforementioned rules while the device part is regulated as a medical device and will have to comply with all the requirements set forth by Regulation 2017/745, or the Medical Devices Regulation (which became applicable on 26 May 2021 and repealed the EU Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or the Medical Devices Directive). Where the medical device and medicinal product form a single integral product (e.g. pre-filled inhalers), if the principal intended action is achieved by the medicine, the product is considered a medicinal product that includes a medical device and the entire product is regulated under the EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, the MA application for the product should include a CE certificate for the device in accordance with the Medical Devices Regulation or, if not CE marked but would need to be certified if marketed separately, the applicant must include an opinion from a notified body on the conformity of device with the Medical Devices Regulation (except for Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices).

The characteristics of non-integral devices used for the administration of medicinal products may impact the quality, safety and efficacy profile of the medicinal products. To the extent that administration devices are co-packaged with the medicinal product or, in exceptional cases, where the use of a specific type of administration device is specifically provided for in the product information of the medicinal product, additional information may need to be provided in the MA application for the medicinal product on the characteristics of the medical device(s) that may impact on the quality, safety and/or efficacy of the medicinal product. The requirements regarding quality aspects for integral drug-device combination products, including devices that are co-packaged with medicinal products, are outlined in an EMA guideline which came into effect on January 1, 2022.

The EU requires that all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the Medical Devices Regulation. The most fundamental  requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Regulation, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU countries to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.

As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the general safety and performance requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence.

All of the aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.

European data collection

The collection and processing of personal data, including health data regarding the EEA is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR”) and similarly, processing of personal data regarding the UK is subject to the UK General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (“UK GDPR” and together with the EU GDPR, referred to as the “GDPR” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), as well as other supplementary national data protection legislation in force in the EEA member states and the UK. The GDPR imposes stringent requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA/UK, including to the United States in certain circumstances. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States and UK may result in administrative penalties and substantial fines of up to 4% total worldwide annual turnover or up to €20 million (£17.5 million for the UK GDPR), whichever is higher. The GDPR  imposes additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and requires us to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with its obligations. We are subject to the GDPR if we have a presence or "establishment" in the EEA/UK (e.g. EEA/UK based subsidiary or operations), are monitoring individuals in the EEA/UK, including when conducting clinical trials with EEA/UK based data subjects (whether the trials are conducted directly by us or through a clinical vendor or partner), or offering approved products or services (if relevant) to EEA/UK based data subjects (regardless of whether involving EEA/UK based subsidiaries or operations). The GDPR regulations are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

Reform of the Regulatory Framework in the European Union

The European Commission introduced legislative proposals in April 2023 that, if implemented, will replace the current regulatory framework in the EU for all medicines (including those for rare diseases and for children). The European Commission has provided the legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the European Council for their review and approval. In October 2023, the European Parliament published draft reports proposing amendments to the legislative proposals, which will be debated by the European Parliament. Once the European Commission’s legislative proposals are approved (with or without amendment), they will be adopted into EU law.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom

The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 .

As a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, following Brexit, the EMA remained responsible for approving novel medicines for supply in Northern Ireland under the EU centralized procedure, and a separate authorization was required to supply the same medicine in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). On February 27, 2023, the UK government and the European Commission announced a political agreement in principle to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol with a new set of arrangements, known as the “Windsor Framework”. The Windsor Framework was approved by the EU-UK Joint Committee on March 24, 2023, and the medicines aspects of the Windsor Framework have applied since January 1, 2025. This new framework fundamentally changes the previous system under the Northern Ireland Protocol, including with respect to the regulation of medicinal products in the UK. In particular, the MHRA is now responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the UK market (i.e., Great Britain and Northern Ireland), and the EMA no longer has any role in approving medicinal products destined for Northern Ireland under the EU centralized procedure. A single UK-wide MA will be granted by the MHRA for all medicinal products to be sold in the UK, enabling products to be sold in a single pack and under a single authorization throughout the UK. In addition, the new arrangements require all medicines placed on the UK market to be labelled “UK only”, indicating they are not for sale in the EU. However, although a separate authorization is now required to market medicinal products in the UK, under an international recognition procedure which was put in place by the MHRA on January 1, 2024, the MHRA may take into account decisions on the approval of an MA from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a UK MA.

Rest of world regulation

For other countries outside the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle East, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, or criminal prosecution.

Additional regulation

In addition to the foregoing, local, state and federal laws regarding such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

Human Capital Resources

We believe the success of our mission largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We believe programs that foster company engagement, diversity, equity and inclusion, growth and development while providing competitive compensation and benefits will attract a diverse population of employees who will bring innovative ideas and creative solutions that will enable the achievement of our goals.  Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.

As of February 14, 2025, we employed 63 total employees, including 46 in research and development and 17 in general and administrative. 14 of our employees hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
