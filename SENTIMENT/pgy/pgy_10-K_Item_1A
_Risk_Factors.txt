Governance
Our cybersecurity governance program is led by our CISO, who has more than 20 years of experience in the cybersecurity field, working for different enterprise organizations, holding multiple patents in the field and has vast knowledge and proven experience in both the technology and risk management domain of cybersecurity.

Our CISO is responsible for hiring appropriate personnel, helping to integrate cybersecurity risk considerations into our overall risk management strategy, and communicating key priorities to relevant personnel.

Our 
CISO
 is also responsible for approving budgets, helping prepare for cybersecurity incidents, approving cybersecurity processes, and reviewing security assessments and other cybersecurity-related reports. 
Additionally, our Technology Risk Committee, who reports material risks from cybersecurity threats to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, is made up of members of our management team, including our CISO, who hold various certifications and have served in various roles related to risk management, technology and cybersecurity.
Our CISO periodically reports risks from cybersecurity threats to our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management members, as well as to our Board of Directors. The Board’s Risk Committee provides oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, including performing a review of all cybersecurity incidents and risks on a quarterly basis, as well as the processes the Company has implemented to address them. The Risk Committee also has access to various reports, summaries or presentations related to cybersecurity threats, risk, and mitigation.
Our cybersecurity incident processes are designed to escalate material cybersecurity incidents to members of our management team depending on the circumstances, who will then work with our incident response team to help the Company mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents of which they are notified, in addition to notifying the Risk Committee, as appropriate.
