Item 1. Business
History and Development of the Company
Pagaya Technologies Ltd. was incorporated on March 20, 2016 and is organized under the laws of the State of Israel. We are registered with the Israeli Registrar of Companies, registration number 51-542127-9. On January 16, 2024, Pagaya announced its plans to relocate its corporate headquarters to its current New York City office, which became effective in February 2024. The U.S. is where we conduct our business, generate the majority of our revenue, and where all of our Partners and SFR Partners are domiciled. The mailing address of our principal executive office is 335 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10017,  telephone number  +1 646-710-7714. Our office in Tel-Aviv, Israel is Azrieli Sarona Bldg, 54th Floor, 121 Derech Menachem Begin, Tel-Aviv, 6701203, Israel, telephone number +972 (3) 715 0920. 
Pagaya was founded with the goal of improving upon legacy underwriting practices in the United States through the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”)-powered technology and data science. We have built and continue to enhance a network connecting financial institutions and their customers with investors, which is designed to facilitate greater access to financial products and services for consumers.  Our business began in personal loans and has expanded to auto loans, point-of-sale and single-family rental (“SFR”).

First, the Company relocated its corporate headquarters to New York City.  Second, the Company elected to voluntarily file on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC.  Third, the Company announced its plan to effect a reverse share split, which became effective on March 8, 2024, as described below and throughout this Form 10-K.
Term Loan Facility and New Revolving Credit Facility
On February 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an initial principal amount of $25 million, which subsequently increased to $35 million, and a 5 year senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility,” and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Facilities”) in an initial principal amount of $255 million. In November 2024, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the Term Loan Facility by $100 million, bringing the total principal amount to $355 million. The Company also increased an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility of $15 million, bringing the total principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility to $50 million.

The Company’s Articles of Association were amended and restated to reflect the reverse share split.
Ordinary Share Offering
On March 13, 2024, the Company priced an offering of 7,500,000 of its Class A Ordinary Shares, no par value, pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Jefferies LLC as representatives of the several underwriters, which is attached as Exhibit 10.24 of this Report. The proceeds from the offer and sale of the securities were approximately $90.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. For additional information, see “
Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.
”
Exchangeable Senior Notes
On October 1, 2024, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $160 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Notes”) due 2029.

Acquisition of Theorem
On October 22, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Theorem Technology, Inc. (“Theorem”), a Silicon Valley-based institutional asset manager focused exclusively on the consumer credit space, managing assets for global institutional investors since its founding in 2014. The Company acquired 100% of Theorem’s equity for approximately $17.5 million, consisting of $10.0 million cash and 504,440 of the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares ($7.5 million worth as of the closing date), with an additional contingent consideration based on achievement of certain performance objectives defined in the purchase agreement. As the transaction has closed recently, the purchase accounting has not yet been completed. For additional information, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  
Ongoing War in Israel 
On October 7, 2023, a terrorist organization primarily based in the Gaza Strip launched a series of attacks on Israel, including in areas where our employees and independent contractors are located. As a result of such attack, on October 8, 2023, Israel officially declared war. Israel’s military response has included, among other things, calling on a large number of army reservists, including Pagaya employees based in Israel as of October 2023. Since that time, all of our employees have returned to their regular work arrangements.
Although the Company’s business operations have not been materially impacted due to this evolving conflict as of the date of this Report, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected due to the ongoing nature of this conflict. Pagaya’s technology infrastructure, including its data, cloud and platform, are located in the United States, with backup systems in place. Pagaya has experienced no disruption as of the date of this Report, either from its lending partners or investors. See 
“Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Our business and the performance of Financing Vehicles may be adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control. These factors include interest rates, rising inflation, the instability of the banking system, acts of war (including the ongoing war in Israel and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict), supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, the wind-down of stimulus programs, unemployment rates, conditions in the housing market, immigration policies, government shutdowns, trade wars or other impacts of tariffs and delays in tax refunds, as well as events such as natural disasters, terrorism, catastrophes, and pandemics (such as COVID-19)”

Business Overview 
Our Business
Pagaya’s mission is to deliver more financial opportunity to more people, more often. We believe our mission will be  accomplished by becoming the trusted lending technology partner for the consumer finance ecosystem, with an expansive product suite that serves lenders and institutional investors (the fee-generating side of our business), fueled by effective and efficient capital and risk management (the capital efficiency side of our business). Both sides of our business work together harmoniously to meet the complex needs of leading financial institutions, enabling increased access to credit for consumers. 
We are a product-focused technology company that deploys sophisticated data science and proprietary, AI-powered technology to enable better outcomes for financial institutions, their existing and potential customers, and institutional or sophisticated investors. 
Since our inception, we have been focused on developing and expanding our flagship lending product - our second-stage reevaluation program. This product, which enables lenders to improve customer acquisition and monetization, is seamlessly (and uniquely) integrated via API to Partners’ loan origination systems and is backed by our proprietary, AI-powered technology. We measure the assets originated by Partners with the assistance of Pagaya’s proprietary technology as Network Volume, a key performance indicator for our business. For more information regarding Network Volume, see “
Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating Metric
” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
As of December 31, 2024, more than 30 Partners were engaged with our network, utilizing our API and proprietary technology to offer financial products, such as personal, auto, or point-of-sale loans, to their customers.
We have built and continue to scale our proprietary, AI-powered technology and data network. Since inception, our network has processed more than $2.6 trillion in loan applications across our consumer credit asset classes. Our data engine includes data from Partner loan applications as well as real-time information from other sources such as credit rating agencies. As of the date of this Annual Report, our network processes more than one application per second. We believe that this combination of high application volume, speed of processing and variety of data enables us to enhance the accuracy and predictive power of our AI technology and rapidly adjust to evolving market conditions and consumer trends. In addition, we believe we are able to measure risk and predict behavior on a more accurate and equitable basis than legacy approaches, and our proprietary, AI-powered technology continuously improves as more data flows through our network.
The scale we have achieved in the consumer credit market has created a large data pool that enables our proprietary, AI-powered technology to provide insights on evolving consumer behavioral, demographic and economic trends. We also leverage our data engine to select, acquire and operate single-family rental homes on behalf of institutional investors. While our SFR business is in early stages, we believe there is significant potential to capture market share in the SFR industry with a tech-first solution and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors.
We have achieved significant scale to date as measured by the number of loan applications that have been processed through our network since our inception. As of December 31, 2024, our network supports more than 30 Partners and SFR Partners to hundreds of investors across five asset classes, which has resulted in the generation of approximately $9.7 billion in Network Volume for the year ended December 31, 2024, which represents greater than six times as compared to our Network Volume for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.6 billion. We believe that the speed of such growth is a function of structural scale advantages embedded in our business model. We develop API connections with each Partner to integrate with their established systems, requiring limited upfront investment by our Partners and results in minimal latency in the processing of application volume by our AI technology. 
Investors can invest in funds and securitization vehicles managed, sponsored and/or administered by Pagaya (together, “Financing Vehicles”). These funds and vehicles offer financial instruments based on underlying assets that have been originated by Partners through our network with the assistance of our AI technology. Investors in our Financing Vehicles range from large institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset management firms, to high-net-worth individuals and family offices. We believe these investors benefit from the diversity of investment opportunities offered through our network, which include different classes of consumer credit and real estate assets originated by multiple financial institutions with the assistance of our AI technology. Certain investors who invest in our Financing Vehicles are related parties and agreements with

Industry Overview
Siloed Data and Technology Infrastructure Hinder Financial Services Providers
We believe that legacy systems create inefficient outcomes for financial services providers and their customers. Consumers desire convenient access to a broad array of financial products, yet many are locked out of access to the financial ecosystem as a product of the limitation of legacy methods of customer credit evaluation. Financial services providers are primarily reliant on their own data history and experience coupled with traditional lagging methodologies for creditworthiness.
For example, the FICO score, which was invented in 1989, is used by over 90% of financial services providers. While a FICO score is rarely used in isolation, many credit evaluation methods are similarly rules-based systems with limited inputs. 
Lenders’ Investments May Favor Brand and User Experience Over Evolving Credit Underwriting and Automation
While financial services providers invest in the development and growth of their businesses, there are a number of competing priorities for the use of these investment dollars. Financial services providers are typically consumer-facing businesses. For this reason, investments in brand and user experience are often prioritized over investments in improvements in underwriting, credit decision-making and automation. 
Investment in Automation
As banking becomes more open, financial services providers are seeking to leverage transaction data to improve verification of consumer assets, income, employment, identity and credit history. In addition, financial services providers are investing in technology to help them harness this data to drive automated workflows that reduce the number of manual tasks. We believe that a digital-only experience is increasingly required to engage with customers and that our product allows our Partners to provide this desired experience to their customers.
Our Product Focus
4
Table of 
Contents
Building off our early success in the personal loan market, we made significant investments in technology and infrastructure over the last few years to expand our product to new markets, such as auto and point of sale. We expect that this diversification will continue in 2025 as we expand our product ecosystem to new lenders across markets.
We believe that the continuous flow of real-time data through our network from our connectivity to more than 30 U.S. lending partners enables enhanced insights on changing economic, demographic and consumer behavioral trends across the United States.
We believe our access to this large and growing pool of data points enables our AI technology and data science to improve upon traditional credit metrics and rules-based underwriting approaches, which are based on a limited number of variables. We believe we benefit, as is typically characteristic of AI and machine learning, from a flywheel effect: incremental training data points—from new applications, new Partners and asset classes—enable enhanced intelligence, which can drive better results for our Partners and investors, which can lead to increased application volume from existing Partners as well from the addition of  new Partners as we strengthen our value proposition. Our AI technology is designed to identify attractive risk-reward opportunities for investors in our Financing Vehicles, by pricing risk more efficiently than traditional methods. 
The Pagaya network is designed to offer streamlined integration with Partners, via modern APIs. Once connected, our network provides an automated solution for transactions, whereby Partners’ customer applications are processed with minimal latency. 
We believe that the growth in our Network Volume demonstrates our ability to scale quickly, as our network generated approximately $9.7 billion in Network Volume in the year ending December 31, 2024, as compared to approximately $1.6 billion in Network Volume in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our Growth Strategies
Expand our product to new, enterprise-level lenders
In 2024, we further expanded our network by onboarding several new partners, including OneMain Financial, a leading consumer finance company, and Avvance, the point-of-sale leading solution offered by US Bank and Elavon, strengthening our presence in auto, personal loan and point-of-sale products. We believe that the addition of each enterprise-level lender could represent an opportunity to connect to millions of new consumers and expand across multiple products and markets. Our existing partner growth and new partner pipeline remain robust, with leading institutions across all asset classes. We continue to make significant progress in monetizing existing partnerships, adding new products to long-standing relationships, and ramping those that are newer to our network.
Deepen Existing Partnerships and enhance network monetization
Higher customer conversion from our flagship product has unlocked opportunities to help our lending partners further monetize their customer relationships, enhance customer lifetime value and remain their customers’ lender of choice. This creates new monetization opportunities for Pagaya. As we continue to demonstrate our value-add, we will work closely with newer partners to elevate existing economic arrangements to the levels we have with our more mature partners. The growth in our Fee Revenue Less Production Costs (FRLPC) continues to be driven by fees from our lending partners, which comprised 69% of total FRLPC in 2024 as compared to 57% in 2023.
Build out the roadmap to expand our product ecosystem
Our recent integrations with large U.S. lenders are deepening our understanding of how these institutions can leverage technology to elevate their customer relationships. We are actively developing new products, such as pre-screen online programs, that allow our partners to reward their existing customers with additional credit opportunities. We believe the continued development of our product roadmap can improve partner economics and diversify our revenue streams over time. 
Drive capital efficiency and profitable growth
We expect to execute a financial strategy that will focus on network monetization, disciplined cost management and an efficient funding and capital allocation plan to optimize net cash flows as we fund new network volume.
Our Team
Our people are a key reason for our success and are essential for our continued growth. Our team-oriented approach, entrepreneurial culture and overall growth trajectory, together with our competitive compensation and benefits, enable us to successfully retain our employees and to effectively recruit new talent aligned with our vision. As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of 553 “Pagayans,” or team members across the globe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Table of 
Contents
We are deeply committed to diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our core goals in this area include becoming an equitable employer of the future, creating an open and equitable consumer banking ecosystem and demonstrating social impact and community investment. To achieve these goals, we cultivate diverse talent pipelines and partner with organizations committed to promoting racial equity and greater accessibility in the financial services ecosystem.
Our Competition
We compete with a variety of technology companies that seek to help financial services providers with the digital transformation of their businesses, particularly with respect to all-digital lending. We also compete with various “second-look” financing providers that offer lenders revenue when they approve applications that had otherwise been turned down. These second-look financing providers operate across markets in which we currently operate or plan to operate in the future.
In sourcing asset investors, we compete with asset originators that utilize capital markets for financing. This includes other fintech lenders and asset management firms in the asset-backed security, structured products, and private funds. We may also face competition from other financial institutions, such as banks, investment funds and credit unions, which provide their balance sheet as a source for funding assets.
In our real estate business, we compete with companies that invest in single-family rental properties, including those that rely on the capital markets for financing. We also face competition from real estate technology companies and traditional real estate management firms, as well as traditional real estate brokerage firms and agents, some of which operate nationally and others that are limited to a specific region or regions. 
We believe the following competitive factors are key strengths of our business:
•
A scalable product with significant growth potential and success to date, with expansion to 30+ U.S. lenders
•
Upfront funding model for loans generated with the assistance of our AI technology that supports optimization of investor returns 
•
Vast dataset on U.S. consumer behavior, economic and demographic trends
•
Real-time processing with API-based integration and minimal latency for Partners and their customers
•
Seamless experience for our Partners’ customers
•
Strong Partner relationships with 100% historical retention since inception
•
Deep, well-established relationships with large institutional investors 
•
Streamlined, tech-enabled access to multiple markets
•
Lean/nimble organization without the bureaucracy of larger financial institutions
•
Culture of growth and innovation
Intellectual Property
Our proprietary, developed technology, which includes deep learning methodologies, our assembled workforce, partner relationships, trade names, data asset, unpatented trade secrets, pending trademarks and domain names are key to our success.
We rely on trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of pending and registered trademarks to protect our brand. In addition, we require our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property created or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
As of December 31, 2024, our intellectual property portfolio included 11 registered and pending trademarks and one patent pending. We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties that typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our proprietary technology.
Government Legislation and Regulation
Our Partners and prospective Partners are highly regulated and are generally required to comply with stringent regulations in connection with performing business functions that our products and services address. Additionally, we facilitate compliance with these regulatory requirements. Although we currently operate our business in an effort to ensure our business itself is not subject to extensive regulation, there is a risk that certain regulations could become applicable to us, including as we expand the functionality and use of our proprietary technology and network. In addition, we and our Partners, vendors, and other service providers must comply with laws and regulatory regimes that apply to us directly and our Partners, vendors, and other service

Refer to Exhibit 21.1 to this Annual Report for a list of our subsidiaries, including our significant subsidiaries.
RISK FACTOR SUMMARY
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial
conditions, or operating results. For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see “Item 1A.—Risk
Factors”:
Risks Related to the Operations of Our Business
•
We are a rapidly growing company with a relatively limited operating history, which may result in increased risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties, and it may be difficult to evaluate our future prospects.
•
Our revenue and FRLPC growth rate and financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance and such growth may slow or reverse over time. 
•
If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
•
We have incurred U.S. GAAP net losses, and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future.
•
Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.

Table of 
Contents
•
Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unexpected failure of a vendor, bank or other third party service provider that presents concentration risks to us or our Partners. 
•
We are heavily dependent on our AI technology. If we are unable to continue to improve our AI technology or if our AI technology does not operate as we expect, contains errors or is otherwise ineffective, we could improperly evaluate products, not be able to process the volume we have historically, and our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
•
We rely on our Partners to originate assets with the assistance of our AI technology. Currently, a limited number of Partners account for a substantial portion of our Network Volume, the financial products facilitated with the assistance of our AI technology, and, ultimately, our Revenue. If these Partners were to cease or limit operations with us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
•
If we are unable to both retain existing Partners and attract and onboard new Partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
•
Our ability to raise capital from asset investors is vital to our ability to offer products to Partners. 
•
A reduction in fee revenues earned from Financing Vehicles could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
•
Our AI technology has not yet been extensively tested during different economic conditions, including down-cycles. 
•
A significant portion of our current revenues are derived from Financing Vehicles that acquire consumer credit assets and related financial products, and as a result, we are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in consumer credit activity and the capital markets.
•
If our estimates, judgments or assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or financial reporting standards or interpretations change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
•
We are subject to risks related to our dependency on our Founders, key personnel, employees and independent contractors, including highly-skilled technical experts, as well as attracting, retaining and developing human capital in a highly competitive market.
•
The funding component of our business related to the Financing Vehicles is highly competitive.
•
We have historically, and may in the future, need to raise additional funds, including but not limited to, through equity, debt, secured borrowings, or convertible debt financings, to support business growth, and those funds may be unavailable on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may be unable to meet our future capital requirements, which could limit our ability to grow and jeopardize our ability to continue our business.
•
We actively evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets.  We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of any such future business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquisition, which could hurt our ability to grow our business.
Risks Related to Technology, Intellectual Property and Data
•
Regulators may assert, and courts may conclude, that certain uses of AI technology leads to unintentional bias or discrimination.
•
Our proprietary AI technology relies in part on the use of our Partners’ borrower data and third-party data, and if we lose the ability to use such data, or if such data contains gaps or inaccuracies, our business could be adversely affected.
•
Cyberattacks, security breaches or similar events may compromise of our information technology systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, or our data could adversely impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results and financial condition.
•
Our Financing Vehicles rely on third-party service providers for a substantial portion of our business activities and for Financing Vehicles, and any disruption of service experienced by such third-party service providers or our failure to manage and maintain existing relationships or identify other high-quality, third-party service providers could harm our reputation, business, results of operations and growth prospects.

Risks Related to our Single Family Rental (“SFR”) Operations
•
If we fail to continuously innovate, improve and expand the technology we use in our SFR operations, including Darwin’s property management platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
•
The SFR market is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully against our existing and future competitors.
•
The success of our SFR operations depends on general economic conditions, the health of the U.S. real estate industry generally, and risks generally incident to the ownership and leasing of single-family rental real estate, and our SFR operations may be negatively impacted by economic and industry downturns, including seasonal and cyclical trends, and volatility in the single-family rental real estate lease market.
•
We are subject to payment-related and leasing fraud from tenants and an increase in or failure to deal effectively with fraud, fraudulent activities, fictitious transactions, or illegal transactions.
•
Our SFR Partners face significant competition in the leasing market for quality residents, which may limit the ability to lease our single-family homes on favorable terms.
•
Compliance with governmental laws, regulations, and covenants that are applicable to our SFR Partners’ properties or that may be passed in the future, including affordability covenants, permit, license, and zoning requirements, may adversely affect our ability to manage customer properties and could adversely affect our growth strategy.
Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment
•
Litigation, regulatory actions, consumer complaints and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses. 
•
If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements, our activities may be restricted, and our ability to conduct business could be materially adversely affected.
•
If obligations by one or more Partners that benefit from our network were subject to successful challenge that the Partner was not the “true lender,” such obligations may be unenforceable, subject to rescission or otherwise impaired, we or other program participants may be subject to penalties, and/or our commercial relationships may suffer, each of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
The CFPB has at times taken expansive views of its authority to regulate consumer financial services, creating uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions or the actions of any other new government agency could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
