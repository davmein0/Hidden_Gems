Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the section titled “Key Components of Statements of Operations” of this Annual Report and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in “Item 1A.—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Pursuant to the FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, discussions related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2022 have been omitted. For such omitted discussions, refer to Pagaya’s Operating Results included in the Annual Report on

Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 25, 2024. 
Company Overview
66
Table of 
Contents
Pagaya’s mission is to deliver more financial opportunity to more people, more often. We believe our mission will be  accomplished by becoming the trusted lending technology partner for the consumer finance ecosystem, with an expansive product suite (the fee-generating side of our business) fueled by effective and efficient capital and risk management (the capital efficiency side of our business). Both sides of our business working harmoniously to meet the complex needs of the leading financial institutions. 
We are a product-focused technology company that deploys sophisticated data science and proprietary, AI-powered technology to enable better outcomes for financial institutions, their existing and potential customers, and institutional or sophisticated investors. 
We have built, and we are continuing to scale, a leading AI and data network for the benefit of financial services and other service providers, their customers, and investors. Services providers integrated in our network, which we refer to as our ‘‘Partners,’’ range from high-growth financial technology companies to incumbent banks and financial institutions. We believe Partners benefit from our network to extend financial products to their customers, in turn helping those customers fulfill their financial needs. These assets originated by Partners with the assistance of Pagaya’s AI technology are eligible to be acquired by Financing Vehicles: (i) funds managed or advised by Pagaya or one of its affiliates, (ii) securitization vehicles sponsored or administered by Pagaya or one of its affiliates and (iii) other similar vehicles (“Financing Vehicles”).
In recent years, investments in digitization have improved the front-end delivery of financial products, upgrading customer experience and convenience. Notwithstanding these advances, we believe underlying approaches to the determination of creditworthiness for financial products are often outdated and overly manual. In our experience, providers of financial services tend to utilize a limited number of factors to make decisions, operate with siloed technology infrastructure and have data limited to their own experience. As a result, we believe financial services providers approve a smaller proportion of their application volume than is possible with the benefit of modern technology, such as our AI technology and data network.
At our core, we are a technology company that deploys data science and technology to drive better results across the financial ecosystem. We believe our solution drives a “win-win-win” for Partners, their customers and potential customers, and investors. First, by utilizing our network, Partners are able to approve more customer applications, which we believe drives superior revenue growth, enhanced brand affinity, opportunities to promote other financial products and decreased unit-level customer acquisition costs. Partners realize these benefits with limited incremental risk or funding requirements. Second, Partners’ customers benefit from enhanced and more convenient access to financial products. Third, investors benefit through gaining exposure to these assets originated by Partners with the assistance of our AI technology and acquired by the Financing Vehicles through our network.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with certain other public companies difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of June 22, 2022, (b) in which we have an annual total gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year; and (ii) the date on which we have issued 
67

Contents
more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Foreign Private Issuer Exemptions
We are technically a “foreign private issuer” under U.S
. Securities and Exchange Commission rules
. Consequently, we are subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. That said, as previously disclosed on January 16, 2024, we have decided to voluntarily file on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC beginning in 2024.  Since then the Company has been filing its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and its annual reports on Form 10-K, and will no longer report on forms 20-F and 6-K. In addition, the Company intends to comply with Regulation FD and the SEC’s proxy rules, and the Company's officers, directors, and 10% shareholders will now also begin reporting on Forms 3, 4 and 5, as applicable. 
Nevertheless, since we are a foreign private issuer (“FPI”), we could elect to return to follow FPI reporting requirements, such as not having to file our annual report on Form 20-F until 120 days after the end of each fiscal year and permitting us to furnish reports on Form 6-K to the SEC regarding certain information required to be publicly disclosed by us in Israel or that is distributed or required to be distributed by us to our shareholders. Based on our foreign private issuer status, we are also not required to (i) file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as a U.S. company whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act, (ii) comply with Regulation FD, which addresses certain restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information or (iii) comply with SEC rules relating to proxy solicitation in connection with shareholder meetings and presentation of shareholder proposals. In addition, among other matters, based on our foreign private issuer status, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are technically exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their purchases and sales of the Ordinary Shares.  
Our
 Economic Model
Pagaya’s revenues are primarily derived from Network Volume. We define Network Volume as the gross dollar value of assets originated by our Partners with the assistance of our artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology
1
 and, with respect to single-family rental operations, the gross dollar value of services, which may include the value of newly onboarded properties onto our Darwin platform. We generate revenue from network AI fees, contract fees, interest income and investment income. Revenue from fees is comprised of network AI fees and contract fees. Network AI fees can be further broken down into two fee streams: AI integration fees and capital markets execution fees.
We primarily earn AI integration fees for the creation and delivery of the assets that comprise our Network Volume.
Capital markets execution and contract fees are primarily earned from investors. Multiple funding channels are utilized to enable the purchase of network assets from our Partners, such as asset backed securitizations. Capital markets execution fees are primarily earned from the market pricing of ABS transactions while contract fees are management, performance and similar fees.
Additionally, we earn interest income from our risk retention holdings and our corporate cash balances and investment income associated with our ownership interests in certain Financing Vehicles and other proprietary investments.
We incur costs when Network Volume is acquired by the Financing Vehicles. These costs, which we refer to as ‘‘Production Costs,’’ compensate our Partners for acquiring and originating assets. Accordingly, the amount and growth of our Production Costs are highly correlated to Network Volume. An important operating metric to evaluate the success of our economic model, therefore, is FRLPC, or fee revenue less Production Costs.
Additionally, we have built what we believe to be a leading data science and AI organization that has enabled us to assist our Partners as they make decisions to extend credit to consumers or for the identification and purchase, or property management, of single-family rental properties. Excluding Production Costs, headcount, technology overhead and research and development expenses represent the significant portion of our expenses.
Key
 Factors Affecting Our Performance
1

Our proprietary technology uses machine learning models as a subset of artificial intelligence that go through extensive testing, validation, and governance processes before they can be used or modified. The machine learning models are static and do not have the ability to self-correct, self-improve, and/or learn over time. Any change to the models requires human intervention, testing, validation, and governance approvals before a change can be made.

Expanded Usage of Our Network by Our Existing Partners 
Our AI technology typically enables Partners to convert a larger proportion of their application volume into originated loans, enabling them to expand their ecosystem and generate incremental revenues. Our Partners have historically seen rapid scaling of origination volume on our network shortly after onboarding and the contribution of Pagaya’s network to Partners’ total origination volume tends to increase over time. By integrating our product, connected lenders can increase originations by up to 25% in some cases.
Adoption of Our Network by Partners 
We devote significant time to, and have a team that focuses on, onboarding and managing Partners to our network. We believe that our success in adding new Partners to our network is driven by our distinctive value proposition: driving significant revenue uplift to our Partners at limited incremental cost or credit risk to the Partner. Our success adding new Partners has contributed to our overall Network Volume growth and driven our ability to rapidly scale new asset classes. In 2024, we expanded our network with several new Partners, including OneMain Financial and Avvance, the point-of-sale leading solution offered by US Bank and Elavon.
Continued Improvements to Our AI Technology 
We believe our historical growth has been 
significantly influenced by improvements to our AI technology, which are in turn driven both by the deepening of our proprietary data network and the strengthening of our AI technology. As our existing Partners grow their usage of our network, new Partners join our network, and as we expand our network into new asset classes, the value of our data asset increa
ses. Our technology improvements thus benefit from a flywheel effect that is characteristic of AI technology, in that improvements are derived from a continually increasing base of training data for our technology. We have found, and we expect to continue to experience, that more data leads to more efficient pricing and greater Network Volume. Since inception, we have evaluated more than $2.6 trillion in application volume.
In addition to the accumulation of data, we make improvements to our technology by leveraging the experience of our research and development specialists. Our research team is central to accelerating the sophistication of our AI technology and expanding into new markets and use cases. We are reliant on these experts’ success in making these improvements to our technology over time. 
Availability and Pricing of Funding from Investors 
Regardless of market conditions, the availability and pricing of funding from investors is critical to our growth. We have diversified our investor network and will continue to seek to further diversify our investor base. In the year ended December 31, 2024, our top 5 ABS investors contributed approximately 54% of our total ABS funding, compared to 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023.
Performance of Assets Originated with the Assistance of Our Proprietary Technology 
The availability of funding from investors is a function of demand for consumer credit and residential real estate assets, as well as the performance of such assets originated with the assistance of our AI technology and purchased by Financing Vehicles. Our AI

technology and data-driven insights are designed to enable relative outperformance versus the broader market. We believe that investors in Financing Vehicles view our AI technology as an important component in delivering assets that meet their investment criteria.  See “
Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Operations of Our Business
” in this Annual Report.
Impact of Macroeconomic Cycles and Global and Regional Conditions
We expect economic cycles to affect our financial performance and related metrics. Macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions, climate-related disruptions, and evolving global conflicts, may affect consumer demand for financial products, our Partners’ ability to generate and convert customer application volume, and the availability and cost of funding from investors through our Financing Vehicles. The war in Israel and Gaza, which escalated following the October 7, 2023, attacks by a terrorist organization primarily based in the Gaza Strip remains a source of uncertainty. While the conflict has not materially disrupted our operations to date, its potential to intensify or expand, coupled with related instability in the Middle East, could adversely impact regional and global economic conditions, energy prices, and investor confidence. Such developments may increase volatility in financial markets, elevate operating costs, or constrain funding availability, potentially affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We continue to monitor the situation closely, though no significant direct impact has been observed as of the date of this Report. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, ongoing since February 2022, persists with no clear resolution as of early 2025. While we have not experienced material impacts on our business from this conflict, prolonged hostilities or further escalation, such as expanded sanctions, disruptions to energy markets, or broader economic fallout, could exacerbate global inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. These factors may indirectly influence consumer credit demand, investor appetite for risk assets, and our Network Volume. We assess this risk as manageable but remain vigilant given its potential to contribute to wider economic disruptions. Macroeconomic pressures, including sustained high interest rates and inflation, continue to shape our operating environment. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have maintained elevated rates into 2025 to combat inflationary trends, increasing borrowing costs and potentially straining borrowers’ ability to service debt. This could lead to higher delinquencies, defaults, and charge-offs, reducing investor returns and dampening demand for assets generated on our platform. Inflation, though moderating from its 2022-2023 peak, remains above historical norms, driving up operating costs such as employee compensation, financing expenses, and technology investments. These pressures have been partially offset by operational efficiencies and growth in application volume from our Partners, supporting net growth in Network Volume despite a higher cost of capital. Global supply chain disruptions, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events linked to climate change, continue to challenge economic stability. These disruptions may indirectly affect our Partners’ ability to serve customers and could increase costs across our network. Meanwhile, the elevated risk-free rate environment has shifted investor preferences, with some favoring safer assets over consumer credit. While our ability to raise funding remains intact, the cost of capital has risen, necessitating adjustments in conversion ratios to meet investor return expectations. Strong Partner application volume has mitigated this impact, sustaining Network Volume growth through 2024 and into early 2025. Adverse developments in the financial sector, such as regional bank stresses, liquidity concerns, or prolonged U.S. federal debt ceiling debates, could further complicate our operating landscape. In 2024, isolated bank failures and downgrades sparked temporary market volatility, though our direct exposure remains limited. Should these events escalate into systemic liquidity issues, they could impair our Partners’ and counterparties’ ability to meet obligations, disrupt funding flows, or destabilize financial markets, adversely affecting our performance. Similarly, ongoing trade tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, and potential tariff escalations could introduce additional uncertainty, though we have not yet seen significant effects on our operations. Economic downturns or prolonged uncertainty may pressure the performance of assets acquired by Financing Vehicles from our network. However, these conditions also provide valuable data to refine our AI technology, enhancing our ability to adapt to shifting market dynamics and deliver value to Partners and investors. Historical events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the current inflationary period have underscored the resilience of our platform, validating its outcomes even amid volatility. For a detailed discussion of uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the “
Item 1A.—Risk Factors
” section in this Annual Report.
Key
 Operating Metric
We collect and analyze operating and financial data of our business to assess our performance, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. In addition to total revenues, net operating income (loss), other measures under U.S. GAAP, and certain non-GAAP financial measures (see discussion and reconciliation herein titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”), we consider Network Volume to be a key operating metric we use to evaluate our business. The following table sets forth our Network Volume for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Network Volume
We believe the Network Volume metric to be a suitable proxy for our overall scale and reach, as we generate revenue primarily on the basis of Network Volume. In addition, Network Volume directly influences Fee Revenue Less Production Cost (FRLPC), a key non-GAAP measure we use to assess operational efficiency. We believe the growth in Network Volume highlights the scalability of our business, which, in turn, affects our operational leverage and profitability. Network Volume is primarily driven by our relationships with our Partners and SFR Partners. We believe that Network Volume has benefited from continuous improvements to our proprietary technology, enabling our network to more effectively identify assets for acquisition by the Financing Vehicles, thereby providing additional investment opportunities to investors. As a result, the expansion of Network Volume provides insights into the effectiveness of our business strategies and the ability to leverage operational efficiencies across different asset classes. Network Volume is comprised of assets across several asset classes, including personal loans, auto loans, residential real estate, and point-of-sale receivables.
Components
 of Results of Operations 
Revenue
We generate revenue from network AI fees, contract fees, interest income and investment income. Network AI fees and contract fees are presented together as Revenue from fees in the consolidated financial statements. Revenue from fees is recognized after applying the five-step model consistent with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers” (“ASC 606”). Revenue from fees is inclusive of network AI fees and contract fees.
Network AI fees.
 Network AI fees can be further broken down into two fee streams: AI integration fees and capital markets execution fees. We earn AI integration fees for the creation and delivery of the assets that comprise our Network Volume. Multiple funding channels are used to enable the purchase of network assets from our Partners, such as ABS, pass-through and forward flow transactions. Capital markets execution fees are earned when a pre-funded, Pagaya-sponsored ABS vehicle is sold by underwriters.
Contract fees.
 Contract fees primarily include administration and management fees, and performance fees. Administration and management fees are contracted upon the establishment of Financing Vehicles and are earned as the Financing Vehicles purchase loans and as the Company provides services over their remaining lives. Performance fees are earned when certain Financing Vehicles exceed contractual return hurdles and a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized is not expected to occur. 
We also earn interest income from our risk retention holdings and cash balances and investment income associated with our ownership interests in certain Financing Vehicles and other proprietary investments.
Costs and Operating Expenses

Costs and operating expenses consist of Production Costs, technology, data and product development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, b
onuses, share-based compensation, and outsourcing comprise a significant component of several of these expense categories. A portion of our non-share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser extent, certain operating expenses (excluding Production Costs) are denominated in the new Israeli shekel (“NIS”), which could result in variability in our operating expenses which are presented in U.S. Dollars.  
Production Costs
Production Costs are primarily comprised of expenses incurred when Network Volume is transferred from Partners into Financing Vehicles, as our Partners are responsible for marketing and customer interaction and facilitating the flow of additional application flow. Accordingly, the amount and growth of our Production Costs are highly correlated to Netwo
rk Volume. Additionally, but to a lesser extent, Production Costs also include expenses incurred to renovate single-family rental properties. 
71
Table of 
Contents
Technology, Data and Product Development
Technology, data and product development expenses primarily comprise costs associated with the maintenance and ongoing development of our network and AI technology, including
 pers
onnel, allocated costs, and other development-related expenses. Technology, data and product development costs, net of amounts capitalized in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are expensed as incurred. The capitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line method over the estimated useful life in technology, data and product development costs. We have invested and believe continued investments in technology, data and product development are important to achieving our strategic objectives. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses, related to Partner onboarding, development, and relationship management, as well as capital markets investor engagement and marketing, are comprised primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, as well as the costs of certain professional services, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred. Sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars may fluctua
te from period to period based on the timing of our investments in our sales and marketing functions. These investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods depending on our pipeline of new Partners and strategic investors.  
General and Administrative 
General and administrative expenses primarily comprise personnel-related costs for our executives, finance, legal and other administrative functions, insurance costs, professional fees for external legal, accounting and other professional services and allocated overhead 
costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. 
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other Income (expense), net primarily consists of changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities and other non-recurring items, including credit-related impairment losses on investments in loans and securities.  
Income Tax Expense

We account for taxes on income in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). We are eligible for certain tax benefits in Israel under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments or the Investment Law at a reduced tax rate of 12%. Accordingly, as we generate taxable income in Israel, our effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the standard corporate tax rate for Israeli companies, which is 23%. Our taxable income generated in the United States or derived from other sources in Israel which is not eligible for tax benefits will be subject to the regular corporate tax rate in their respective tax jurisdictions. 
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations is a result of our investments in certain of our consolidated variable interest entities (‘‘VIEs’’) and consists of the portion of the net income of these consolidated entities that is not attributable to us.

Total revenue and other income, increased by $220.2 million, or 27%, to $1,032.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $812.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from fees, partially offset by decreases in interest income and investment income. 
Revenue from fees increased by $231.7 million, or 30%, to $1,004.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $772.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $220.1 million increase in Network AI fees, comprised of AI integration fees and capital markets execution fees, from $696.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $916.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in Network AI fees was primarily driven by improved economics in AI integration fees earned from certain Partners, as well as the growth in Network Volume, which increased by 17% from $8.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $9.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. These increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in capital markets execution fees earned from our ABS transactions during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Contract fees, comprised of administration and management fees, performances fees, and servicing fees, increased by $11.7 million from $76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $88.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting $4.4 million contributions from Theorem Technology, Inc. (“Theorem”) and an increase in net asset values of the assets held by certain Financing Vehicles driven by continued business growth.
Interest income decreased by $6.5 million, or 17%, to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in interest income was directly related to our risk retention holdings and related securities held in our consolidated VIEs as well as certain risk retention holdings held directly by our consolidated subsidiaries. For further information, see “—Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.” The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of changes in structure and composition of the investments in loans and securities portfolio, and lower interest income on our cash balances. 
Investment income decreased by $5.1 million to a loss of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting an unfavorable impact from the change in valuation of certain proprietary investments.

Technology, data and product development costs in the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $2.2 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding $1.2 million contributions from Theorem in the current period, technology, data and product development costs increased $1.0 million, the increase was primarily driven by a $9.2 million increase in software depreciation expense, including a $0.8 million increase in impairment charge for capitalized software development costs, and a $1.8 million increase in overhead allocation and other miscellaneous costs, partially offset by a $10.2 million decrease in personnel-related expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we capitalized $23.0 million and $26.5 million of software development costs, respectively. Depreciation expense, including impairment charges, for capitalized software development costs was $26.5 million and $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $331.2 million, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a higher credit-related impairment loss of $279.5 million on certain investments, driven by changes in the fair value of investments in loans and securities as a result of fluctuations in key inputs to the discounted cash flow models used to determine fair value. We consolidate certain VIEs which hold investments in securities which experienced a credit-related impairment loss of $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 that are not attributable to Pagaya, but rather are attributable to the VIEs noncontrolling interests. For further information, please see “—Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.” Also contributing to the increase were higher interest expenses of $59.3 million due to increased borrowing to support business growth, partially offset by a $4.2 million favorable impact from the changes in fair value remeasurement of warrants.

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $24.0 million, or 35%, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was driven by the net loss generated by our consolidated VIEs associated with our risk retention holdings. This amount represented the portion of net loss of the consolidated VIEs which was not attributable to Pagaya, but rather to the noncontrolling interest holders. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests reported interest income of $5.6 million generated from risk retention holdings offset by the credit-related impairment loss of $50.1 million on the same risk retention holdings.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the non-GAAP financial measures FRLPC, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with additional information about our financial performance and to enhance the overall understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with the performance of other companies. 
However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our consolidated financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

To address these limitations, we provide a reconciliation of FRLPC, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view FRLPC, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with their respective related U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
FRLPC, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA 
FRLPC, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below (in thousands):

FRLPC is defined as revenue from fees less production costs. We use FRLPC as part of overall assessment of performance, including the preparation of our annual budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to our shareholders excluding share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, impairment, including credit-related charges, restructuring expenses, transaction-related expenses, and non-recurring expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to our shareholders excluding share-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, impairment, including credit-related charges, restructuring expenses, transaction-related expenses, non-recurring expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions, interest expense, depreciation expense, and provision (and benefit from) for income taxes. 
These items are excluded from our Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA measures because they are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, is not driven by core results of operations and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful.
We believe FRLPC, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included FRLPC, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA in this report because these are key measurements used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting. However, this non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

FRLPC has grown during 2023 and 2024 primarily as a result of our ability to monetize the value creation inherent in our lending product. Approximately 50% of our lending partnerships are generating FRLPC from both our lending and investor products, while the remaining 50% are only generating FRLPC from our investor products.

Liquidity
 and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $226.5 million and $222.5 million, respectively. 
Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital resources are to purchase and finance risk retention requirements, invest in technology, data and product development and to attract, recruit and retain a strong employee base, as well as to fund potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, if any. We intend to continue to make strategic investments to support our business plans. 
We do not have capital expenditure commitments as the vast majority of our capital expenditures relate to the capitalization of certain compensation and non-compensation expenditures used in the development and improvement of our proprietary technology.
There are numerous risks to the Company’s financial results, liquidity and capital raising, some of which may not be quantified in the Company’s current estimates. The principal factors that could impact liquidity and capital needs are a prolonged inability to adequately access funding in the capital markets or in bilateral agreements, including as a result of macroeconomic conditions such as rising interest rates and higher cost of capital, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and the continuing market adoption of the Company’s network.
We expect to fund our operations with existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, including cash flows from investments in loans and securities, and additional secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. We may also raise additional capital, including through borrowings under the credit facility(see further description of the credit facility below in the section titled “
Credit Agreement
”) or through the sale or issuance of equity or debt securities, as described below in the sections titled “
Shelf Registration Statement
” and “
Ordinary Share Offering
,” as well as the issuance of up to an additional 1,666,666 Series A Preferred Shares. The ownership interest of our shareholders will be, or could be, diluted as a result of sales or issuances of equity or debt securities, and the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders of Class A Ordinary Shares. We intend to support our liquidity and capital position by pursuing diversified sources of financing, including debt financing, secured borrowings, or equity financing. The rates, terms, covenants and availability of such additional financing is not guaranteed and will be dependent on not only macro-economic factors, but also on Pagaya-specific factors such as the results of our operations and the returns generated by loans originated with the assistance of our AI Technology. 
Additional debt financing, such as secured or unsecured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, credit facilities or corporate bonds, and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Our future

capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in “
Item 1A.—Risk Factors
” in this Annual Report.
In addition, we will receive the proceeds from any exercise of any public warrants and private placement warrants in cash. Each public warrant and each private placement warrant that was issued and exchanged for each EJFA Private Placement Warrant in the EJFA Merger entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share at a price of $138 per share (as adjusted for the 1-for-12 reverse share split). Following the 1-for-12 reverse share split effective March 2024, each warrant entitles the holder to purchase 1/12 of a Class A Ordinary Share (or equivalently, 12 warrants are required to obtain 1 Class A Ordinary Share). The aggregate amount of proceeds could be up to $169.6 million if all such warrants are exercised for cash. We expect to use any such proceeds for general corporate and working capital purposes, which would increase our liquidity.
As of March 11, 2025, the price of our Class A Ordinary Shares was $9.89 per share. We believe the likelihood that warrant holders will exercise their public warrants and private placement warrants that were issued and exchanged for EJFA Private Placement Warrants in the EJFA Merger, and therefore the amount of cash proceeds that we would receive, is dependent upon the market price of Class A Ordinary Shares. If the market price for our Class A Ordinary Shares is less than $138 per share, we believe warrant holders will be unlikely to exercise on a cash basis their public warrants and private placement warrants that were issued and exchanged for EJFA Private Placement Warrants in the EJFA Merger. To the extent the public warrants and private placement warrants are exercised by warrant holders, ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted as a result of such issuances. Moreover, the resale of Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of such warrants, or the perception of such sales, may cause the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares to decline and impact our ability to raise additional financing on favorable terms. See 
“Item 1A.—Risk Factors—We have and may need to continue to raise additional funds in the future, including but not limited to, through equity, debt, secured borrowings, or convertible debt financings, to support business growth, and those funds may be unavailable on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may be unable to meet our future capital requirements, which could limit our ability to grow and jeopardize our ability to continue our business” and “Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ownership of our Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants”
 in this Annual Report.
We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing related to such acquisitions or investments. In the event that we pursue additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Additionally, as a result of any of these actions, we may be subject to restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing these transactions that may place limitations on us and we may be required to pledge collateral as security. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition. It is also possible that the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or that one or more of the significant judgments or estimates could prove to be materially incorrect.
Securitizations
In connection with asset-backed securitizations, we sponsor and establish securitization vehicles to purchase loans originated by our Partners. Securities issued from our asset-backed securitizations are senior or subordinated, based on the waterfall criteria of loan payments to each security class. The subordinated residual interests issued from these transactions are first to absorb credit losses in accordance with the waterfall criteria. To comply with risk retention regulatory requirements, we retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the securities issued by securitization vehicles and may choose to hold more than 5% depending on many factors. In ordinary course of business, we enter into certain financing arrangements to finance our risk retention balance in certain notes and securities retained from securitization transactions. From time to time, the Company makes cash deposits that serve to collateralize guarantees for related transactions, included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. For further information, see Note 6 and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
The Committed Equity Financing
On August 17, 2022, we entered into the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement and the Equity Financing Registration Rights Agreement with B. Riley Principal Capital II. Pursuant to the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, we have the right to sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II, up to $300 million of our Class A Ordinary Shares, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, from time to time during the 24-month term of the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement. Sales of our Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, and the timing of any sales, are solely at our option, and we are under no obligation to sell any securities to B. Riley Principal Capital II under the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement.

Equity Financing Purchase Agreement.
Shelf Registration Statement
On October 4, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (the “Shelf Registration”) with the SEC that was declared effective on October 16, 2023. Under this Shelf Registration, we may, from time to time, offer and sell in one or more offerings Class A Ordinary Shares, various series of debt securities and/or warrants to purchase any of such securities, either individually or in combination with any of these securities, up to $500 million. 
Ordinary Share Offering
On March 13, 2024, the Company priced an offering of 7,500,000 of its Class A Ordinary Shares, no par value, pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Jefferies LLC as representatives of the several underwriters. The proceeds from the offer and sale of the securities are approximately $90.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and fees and offering expenses payable by the Company.

Operating Activities
Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for ordinary course of business, with the primary use related to employee and personnel-related expenses. As of December 31, 2024, we had 553 employees, compared to 712 on December 31, 2023. During the first and second quarters of 2024, we reduced our headcount by over 20% across our Israel and U.S. offices. This reduction in workforce enabled us to streamline our operations resulting in cost savings. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $66.5 million, an increase of $56.9 million from net cash provided by operating activities of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This reflects our net loss including noncontrolling interests of $445.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $510.1 million and net cash inflows of $2.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets net of operating liabilities. 
Non-cash charges primarily consisted of (1) impairment losses on investments in loans and securities, which increased by $279.5 million driven by changes in the fair value of investments in loans and securities as a result of fluctuations in key inputs to the discounted cash flow models used to determine fair value, of which $50.1 million is not attributable to Pagaya, but rather attributable to the VIEs noncontrolling interests, (2) share-based compensation, which decreased by $9.6 million, (3) depreciation and amortization, which increased by $9.6 million primarily from capitalized software, and (4) fair value adjustment to warrant liability, which decreased by $4.2 million driven by changes in the market price of our Class A Ordinary Shares.
Our net cash flows resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities increased by $23.0 million to net cash inflows of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net cash outflows $20.9 million for the same period in 2023, reflecting cost saving initiatives.  
Investing Activities

Our primary uses of cash in investing activities are the purchase of risk retention assets of sponsored securitization vehicles and investments in equity method and other investments.  
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of $498.6 million was primarily attributable to purchases of risk retention assets of $693.9 million, which increased by $127.8 million driven by business growth and

management’s decision to purchase more than the required minimum risk retention holdings and the acquisition of Theorem Technology, Inc. of $9.1 million, partially offset by proceeds received from existing risk retention assets of $227.8 million, which also increased by $55.7 million.
Financing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of $436.7 million was primarily attributable to $325.2 million of proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs, $152.0 million of proceeds from issuance of exchangeable senior notes and $90.0 million of proceeds from sale of ordinary shares. These cash inflows were partially offset by $90.0 million of repayments of the SVB revolving credit facility and $14.0 million of repayment of the long-term debt.
Indebtedness
Exchangeable Senior Notes
On October 1, 2024, Pagaya US Holding Company LLC (“Pagaya US”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $160 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.125% exchangeable senior notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The issuance was in connection with a purchase agreement dated September 26, 2024, with certain initial purchasers. The Company used the net proceeds from the Notes to repay higher-cost debt and reduce interest expense, with the remainder allocated for general corporate purposes.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2025, and mature on October 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or exchanged. The Notes are exchangeable for cash, Class A Ordinary Shares of the Company, or a combination of both, at the Company’s discretion, subject to certain conditions.
The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Pagaya US and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by the Company. The Notes rank equally in right of payment with other senior, unsecured indebtedness of Pagaya US and the Company and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Pagaya US’s subsidiaries.
The initial exchange rate of the Notes is 71.4669 Class A Ordinary Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $13.99 per share). The exchange rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) or if Pagaya US redeems the Notes, Pagaya US will, in certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate by a number of additional Class A Ordinary Shares for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or to convert its Notes called for redemption during the related redemption exchange period.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 2, 2029, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions. These conditions include, among others, the sale price of the Class A Ordinary Shares exceeding 130% of the initial exchange price for a specified number of trading days. On or after July 2, 2029 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding October 1, 2029, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders at any time regardless of the specified conditions.
Pagaya US may redeem the Notes in whole or in part on or after October 5, 2027, only if the last reported sale price per Class A Ordinary Share exceeds 130% of the exchange price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) of the Company occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Pagaya US to repurchase their Notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of
Credit Agreement
On February 2, 2024, the Company entered into certain Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an initial principal amount of $25 million, which subsequently increased to $35 million, and a 5 year senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility,” and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Facilities”) in an initial principal amount of $255 million. In November 2024, the Company

amended the Credit Agreement to increase the Term Loan Facility by $100 million, bringing the total principal amount to $355 million. The Company also increased an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility of $15 million, bringing the total principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility to $50 million. In February 2025, the Company further increased the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by $8 million, resulting in a total principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility of $58 million. 
The Facilities replace the SVB Revolving Credit Facility. In addition to replacing the SVB Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds of borrowings under the Facilities may be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
The Company may voluntarily prepay borrowings under the Facilities at any time and from time to time subject to, in regards to voluntary prepayments and certain mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan Facility, a 3.00% fee if paid prior to the first anniversary of the Term Loan Facility, 2.00% if paid after the first anniversary but prior to the second anniversary, 1.00% if after the second anniversary but prior to the third anniversary, and 0.50% if after the third anniversary but prior to the fourth anniversary. In each case, prepayments of the Facilities may be subject to the payment of “breakage” costs. 
The Facilities contain certain customary mandatory prepayment events, including requirements to prepay the Term Loan Facility with excess cash flow and with the net cash proceeds from certain asset dispositions and casualty events, subject to customary reinvestment rights and other exceptions.  
No amortization payments are required to be made in respect of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Amortization payments are required to be made in respect of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility in amount of 1.25% per quarter of the original principal amount of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility.
Borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, (i) a base rate (determined based on the prime rate and subject to a 2.00% floor) plus a margin of 6.50%  and (ii) an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus a margin of 7.50%. A commitment fee accrues on any unused portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum of 0.25% and is payable quarterly in arrears.
The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company’s material, wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”) and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to certain customary exceptions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants, which include, among other things, limitations on the ability of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain fundamental changes, make certain dispositions and investments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and make restricted payments and other distributions.  The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants customary for a credit facility of this type, which include, among other things, a maximum first lien leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum tangible book value ratio.  The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative covenants customary for a credit facility of its type, including customary reporting covenants.
The Credit Agreement includes events of default related to, among other things, failure to pay amounts due under the Credit Agreement, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, defaults under other material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, material judgment defaults and change of control, in each case, subject to customary cure periods where appropriate.
The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms thereof, which are incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 10.7.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an outstanding balance of $321.3 million, which is recorded within current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet, and the Company had letters of credit issued in the amount of $24.3 million, and $25.7 million of remaining capacity available under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes it is in compliance with all covenants.  
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
During the normal course of business, we enter into certain lease contracts with lease terms through 2032. As of December 31, 2024, the total remaining contractual obligations are approximately $47.1 million, of which $9.3 million is for the next 12 months. In 2023, we entered into a purchase commitment with our third-party cloud computing web services provider, which included an annual purchase commitment of $4.6 million for the period from October 2023 through September 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the total remaining contractual obligations are approximately $3.6 million, all of which is for the next 12 months. We may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment based on usage. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications or loss guarantees of varying scope and terms to customers and other third parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. 
82

These indemnifications may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future indemnification payments may not be subject to a cap. As of December 31, 2024, there have been no known events or circumstances that have resulted in a material indemnification liability and the Company did not incur material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications. For certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee or a derivative, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments the Company could be required to make under these guarantees totaled $35.0 million. In accordance with the guarantee contracts, the maximum potential payment amount has been segregated and recognized within restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet. 
For a discussion of our long-term debt obligations and operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2024, see Note 6 and Note 10, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in 
this Annual Report. 
Off-Balance
 Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, we engage in activities with unconsolidated VIEs, including our sponsored securitization vehicles, which we contractually administer. To comply with risk retention regulatory requirements, we retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the securities issued by sponsored securitization vehicles. From time to time, we may, but are not obligated to, purchase assets from the Financing Vehicles. Such purchases could expose us to loss. For additional information, refer to Note 8 
to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere included in this Annual Report.
Critical
 Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 
In 2024, we have reassessed the critical accounting policies and determined that in addition to the updates below relating to fair value (previously identified as “Loans and investments in securities”), we no longer consider revenue recognition, consolidation and variable interest entities or recoverability of deferred tax assets to be critical accounting estimates as the application of the relevant US GAAP accounting policies does not involve significant levels of uncertainty. 
We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to our financial results and the understanding of our past and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s estimates and assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because the information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making our estimate and (2) changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.
Fair Value
Investments in loans and securities, which include whole loans and notes and residual interests in securitizations, are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The estimate of fair value of these financial assets requires significant judgment. We use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these financial assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The cash flow model uses both observable and unobservable inputs and reflects our best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value of the particular financial asset. Primary inputs that require significant judgment include discount rates, net credit loss expectations, expected prepayment rates and consideration of any optional redemption features in our investment securities.
As it relates to net credit loss expectations, the most significant unobservable input, management considers a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss trends, origination or vintage analysis, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, recovery rates and current economic conditions. We also take into consideration certain qualitative factors, in which we adjust our quantitative baseline using our best judgment to consider the inherent uncertainty regarding future economic conditions and consumer loan performance.
83
Table of 
Contents
Additionally, we determine whether an impairment has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. We determine whether a credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize the credit loss portion through earnings in the income statement and the noncredit loss portion in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The underlying assumptions, estimates, and assessments we use to provide for fair value are assessed and updated quarterly, as necessary, to reflect our view of current conditions, which can result in changes to the fair value of investments in loans and securities. It is possible that we will experience material differences in the fair value of investments in loans and securities.
Prior to 2023, we wrote down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it was more likely than not we would be required, or we intended to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or we did not expect to collect cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the investment.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in market prices. Our market risk exposure primarily relates to fluctuations in credit risk. We are exposed to market risk directly through investments in loans and securities held on our consolidated balance sheets and access to the securitization markets. 
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from individual borrower default due to inability or unwillingness to meet their financial obligations. The performance of certain financial instruments, including investments in loans, securitization notes and residual certificates on our consolidated balance sheets, is dependent on the credit performance. To manage this risk, we monitor borrower payment performance and utilize our proprietary, AI-powered technology to evaluate individual loans in a manner that we believe is reflective of the credit risk.
The fair values of these loans, securitization notes, and residual certificates are estimated based on a discounted cash flow model which involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and assumptions, the most significant of which is expected credit losses. Accordingly, these instruments are sensitive to changes in credit risk. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were exposed to credit risk on $764 million and $717 million, respectively, of investments in loans and securities held on our consolidated balance sheet, with $659 million and $618 million, respectively, representing net exposure exclusive of non-controlling interests. We have a portfolio risk monitoring process that includes internal monitoring as well as competitor / market assessments, macro-economic trends, and associated stress testing. Loans and related risk retention securities are monitored throughout the entire lifecycle. This risk monitoring framework provides timely and actionable feedback on managing credit risk exposures.
We are also exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions holding our cash or providing access to our credit line. We maintain our cash deposits in highly-rated financial institutions. In the United States, the majority of our cash deposits are held at federally insured accounts. We manage this risk by maintaining our cash deposits at well-established, well-capitalized financial institutions and diversifying our counterparties.
Interest Rate Risk
The interest rates charged on the loans originated by Partners are subject to change by the platform sellers, originators, and/or servicers. Higher interest rates could negatively impact collections on the underlying loans, leading to increased delinquencies, defaults, and our borrower bankruptcies, all of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. This would also impact future loans and securitizations.
Additionally, we maintain certain financing sources with varying degrees of interest rate sensitivities, including floating-rate interest payments on Pagaya’s credit facilities. Accordingly, trends in the prevailing interest rate environment can influence interest expense/payments and harm the results of our operations. For additional information, see “
Item 7.—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.
”
We also rely on securitization transactions, with notes of those transactions typically bearing a fixed coupon. For future securitization issuances, higher interest rates could effect overall deal economics as well as the returns we would generate on our related risk retention investments.

Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign currency exchange rates do not pose a material market risk exposure. However, given the compensation and non-compensation expenses denominated in Israeli Shekel, our inability or failure to manage foreign exchange risk could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). 
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and overseen by our Board of Directors, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance, that its objectives will be met. In addition, 
85
Table of 
Contents
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate but such improvements will be subject to the same inherent limitations outlined in this section.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered accounting firm, Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer, a member of EY Global, has not audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information
Company Trading Plans or Other Arrangements
Subject to compliance with U.S. and Israel securities laws, rules and regulations, our directors and executive officers have adopted, and may adopt, individual share trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a “Rule 10b5-1 Plan”), in which they will contract with a broker to buy or sell our Class A Ordinary Shares on a periodic basis. Under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the director or officer. The director or officer may amend or terminate the plan in some circumstances. Our directors and executive officers may buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan when they are not in possession of material, non-public information.
Director and Officer 
Trading Arrangements
Our directors and officers (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(f)) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act.

Taxation
U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations of the ownership and disposition of our Class A Ordinary Shares. This discussion is based on the Code, Treasury Regulations, published positions of the IRS, court decisions and other applicable authorities, all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion applies only to Class A Ordinary Shares that are held as capital assets within the meaning of the Code (generally, property held for investment). The following does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential U.S. federal income tax effects arising in connection with the ownership and disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares. Pagaya has not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding any matter discussed herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth below.
This discussion does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances or status including:
•
our officers or directors;
•
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;
86
Table of 
Contents
•
tax-exempt entities or governmental organizations;
•
tax-qualified retirement plans;
•
regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;
•
brokers, dealers, or traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting;
•
persons that elect to mark their securities to market;
•
certain expatriates and former citizens or residents of the United States;
•
persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar;
•
persons holding Class A Ordinary Shares as part of a hedging, integrated, straddle, conversion or constructive sale transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
•
S corporations, partnerships, or other entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);
•
persons that actually or constructively own 5% or more of our shares by vote or value; and
•
persons that acquired Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation or in connection with services.
This discussion does not address estate or gift taxes, the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code, or any state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations or any tax considerations other than U.S. federal income tax considerations.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is any beneficial owner of Class A Ordinary Shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust if (i) a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions, or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Class A Ordinary Shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership  generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the owner or participant level. Accordingly, partners and partnerships considering an investment in Class A Ordinary Shares should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations to them of an investment in Class A Ordinary Shares.
THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES TO ANY PARTICULAR HOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE HOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. EACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.
Taxation of dividends and other distributions on Class A Ordinary Shares
Distributions of cash or other property to a U.S. Holder with respect to such U.S. Holder’s Class A Ordinary Shares generally will be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of Pagaya’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits generally will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder’s basis in its Class A Ordinary Shares (but not below zero) and, to the extent in excess of such basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such Class A Ordinary Shares. Because Pagaya does not intend to determine its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, distributions made by Pagaya generally will be reported as dividends. In the case of corporate U.S. Holders, such dividends generally will be subject to tax at regular U.S. graduated income tax rates and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations.
In the case of non-corporate U.S. Holders, such dividends generally will be subject to tax at preferential long-term capital gains rates only if (i) Class A Ordinary Shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States or (ii) Pagaya is eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and Israel (the “Treaty”), in each case, provided that Pagaya is not treated as a PFIC at the time the dividend was paid or in the previous year and certain other requirements are met. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower rate for any dividends paid with respect to Class A Ordinary Shares.
Subject to certain exceptions, dividends on Class A Ordinary Shares generally will be treated as non-U.S. source income and  generally will constitute “passive category” income for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. As described under “
Certain

Material Israeli Tax Considerations,
” a U.S. Holder may be subject to Israeli withholding taxes on such dividends. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, a Treaty-eligible U.S. Holder may be eligible to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any Israeli income taxes paid or withheld with respect to dividends on Class A Ordinary Shares to the extent such taxes are nonrefundable under the Treaty. Under current Treasury Regulations, which apply to foreign taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 a U.S. Holder may in some circumstances be prohibited from claiming a foreign tax credit with respect to certain non-U.S. taxes that are not creditable under applicable income tax treaties. Instead of claiming a credit for non-U.S. taxes, a U.S. Holder may elect to deduct such taxes in computing its taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that such U.S. Holder does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for any non-U.S. income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year. The rules governing foreign tax credits and the deductibility of foreign taxes are complex. All U.S. Holders, whether or not they are Treaty-eligible, should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits and the deductibility of foreign taxes in light of their particular circumstances.
Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares
Upon a sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss. The amount of gain or loss recognized generally will be equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Class A Ordinary Shares sold or exchanged in such disposition.
Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares generally will be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the U.S. Holder’s holding period in its Class A Ordinary Shares exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains of individuals and certain other non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.
Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. As a consequence, Israeli taxes (including withholding taxes), if any, imposed on any such gain may not be creditable against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability under the U.S. foreign tax credit limitations of the Code. U.S. Holders that are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty may apply the Treaty to treat such gain as Israeli source, however. Notwithstanding this, pursuant to recently issued Treasury Regulations, it is possible that Treaty-eligible U.S. Holders that do not apply the Treaty and U.S. Holders that are not eligible for benefits under the Treaty may not be able to claim a foreign tax credit for any Israeli taxes imposed on a disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares. The rules regarding foreign tax credits and the deductibility of foreign taxes are complex. All U.S. Holders, whether or not they are Treaty-eligible, should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits and the deductibility of foreign taxes in light of their particular circumstances.
Passive foreign investment company considerations
Definition of a PFIC
A non-U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year is passive income (the “income test”) or (ii) at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year (generally determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year) produce or are held for the production of passive income (the “asset test”). For this purpose, a corporation generally is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets and earning its proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, at least 25% (by value) of the stock. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of certain passive assets. For purposes of these rules, interest income earned by a corporation is considered to be passive income and cash held by a corporation is considered to be a passive asset (other than a limited amount of cash held for short-term working capital needs).
PFIC status of Pagaya
The legislative history of the relevant Code provisions indicates that the total value of a publicly-traded foreign corporation’s assets generally will be treated as equal to the sum of the aggregate value of its outstanding stock plus its liabilities for purposes of the asset test, and publicly-traded foreign corporations often employ such market capitalization method to value their assets. However, the IRS has not issued guidance conclusively addressing how to value a publicly-traded foreign corporation’s assets for PFIC purposes. The trading value of our Class A ordinary shares has in the past, and is likely to continue to fluctuate. In particular, the market price of the shares of U.S. listed technology companies (including us) has been especially volatile in recent years. In addition, we have a dual class share structure that has the effect of concentrating voting power in our Class B ordinary shares, which are not publicly traded. Our Class A ordinary shares, which are publicly traded, represent less than 20% of the voting power of all our outstanding shares. In certain circumstances, including under volatile market conditions and considering the percentage of voting power represented by our publicly-traded Class A ordinary shares, we believe it may be appropriate to employ alternative methods to determine the value of our assets other than the market capitalization method. After considering the total value of our assets determined under an alternative valuation method that takes into account a control premium, we believe that we were not a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2024. However, if the market capitalization method 
88

were determined to be the only appropriate method of valuing our assets, we may well be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2024. Therefore, there can be no certainty that the IRS will not challenge such a position and determine that based on the IRS’s interpretation of the asset test, we were a PFIC for any prior tax year. In addition, PFIC status is a factual determination that must be made annually after the close of each taxable year. The trading value of our Class A ordinary shares is likely to continue to fluctuate while the market price of the shares of U.S. listed technology companies continues to be volatile, which may affect the determination of whether we will be considered a PFIC. As our market capitalization and the composition of our income, assets, and operations are subject to change, we cannot assure you that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. It is possible that the IRS may take a contrary position with respect to our determination in any particular year. Certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to a United States Holder if we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which such United States Holder holds our Class A ordinary shares. Under the PFIC rules, if we were considered a PFIC at any time that a United States Holder holds our Class A ordinary shares, we would continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such holder’s investment unless (i) we cease to be a PFIC, and (ii) the United States Holder has made a “deemed sale” election under the PFIC rules.
Application of PFIC rules to Class A Ordinary Shares
If (i) Pagaya is determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder and (ii) the U.S. Holder did not make a timely and effective QEF Election (as defined below) for Pagaya’s first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) Class A Ordinary Shares (such taxable year as it relates to each U.S. Holder, the “First PFIC Holding Year”) or a Mark-to-Market Election (as defined below), then such holder generally will be subject to special rules (the “Default PFIC Regime”) with respect to:
•
any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Class A Ordinary Shares; and
•
any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of Class A Ordinary Shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for such Class A Ordinary Shares).
Under the Default PFIC Regime:
•
the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for its Class A Ordinary Shares;
•
the amount of gain allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the period in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of the first taxable year in which Pagaya is a PFIC, will be subject to tax as ordinary income;
•
the amount of gain allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder included in such U.S. Holder’s holding period will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and
•
an additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder in respect of the tax attributable to each such other taxable year of such U.S. Holder included in such U.S. Holder’s holding period.
QEF Election and Mark-to-Market Election
In general, if Pagaya is determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may avoid the Default PFIC Regime with respect to its Class A Ordinary Shares by making a timely and effective “qualified electing fund” election under Section 1295 of the Code (a “QEF Election”) for such holder’s First PFIC Holding Year. In order to comply with the requirements of a QEF Election with respect to Class A Ordinary Shares, a U.S. Holder must receive certain information from Pagaya. Because Pagaya does not intend to provide such information, however, the QEF Election will not be available to U.S. Holders with respect to Class A Ordinary Shares.
Alternatively, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable year, owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable shares, the U.S. Holder may make a mark-to-market election (a “Mark-to-Market Election”) with respect to such shares for such taxable year. A U.S. Holder that makes a valid Mark-to-Market Election for such holder’s First PFIC Holding Year generally will not be subject to the Default PFIC Regime with respect to its Class A Ordinary Shares as long as such shares continue to be treated as marketable shares. Instead, the U.S. Holder generally will include as ordinary income for each year that Pagaya is treated as a PFIC, the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its Class A Ordinary Shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted basis in its Class A Ordinary Shares. The U.S. Holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of its Class A Ordinary Shares over the fair market value of its Class A Ordinary Shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the Mark-to-Market Election). The U.S. Holder’s basis in its Class A Ordinary Shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any additional gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of the Class A Ordinary Shares in a taxable year in which Pagaya is treated as a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income. Special tax rules may also apply if a U.S. Holder makes a Mark-to-Market Election for a taxable year after such holder’s First PFIC Holding Year.

The Mark-to-Market Election is available only for stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC, including Nasdaq. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax considerations relevant to a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to Class A Ordinary Shares in their particular circumstances.
If Pagaya is determined to be a PFIC and, at any time, has a non-U.S. subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally will be deemed to own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC, and could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if Pagaya receives a distribution from, or disposes of all or part of Pagaya’s interest in, the lower-tier PFIC or the U.S. Holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in the lower-tier PFIC. A Mark-to-Market Election generally will not be available with respect to such lower-tier PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax considerations relevant to the deemed ownership of lower-tier PFICs.
A U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder, may be required to file an IRS Form 8621 with such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax return (whether or not a QEF Election or a Mark-to-Market Election is made) and provide such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. The rules governing PFICs and QEF Elections and Mark-to-Market Elections are complex and their application is affected by various factors in addition to those described above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of Class A Ordinary Shares should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of the PFIC rules to Class A Ordinary Shares in their particular circumstances.
THE PFIC RULES ARE COMPLEX AND THEIR APPLICATION IS AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE. ALL U.S. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE PFIC RULES TO THEM, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER A QEF ELECTION (OR A QEF ELECTION ALONG WITH A PURGING ELECTION), A MARK-TO-MARKET ELECTION OR ANY OTHER ELECTION IS AVAILABLE AND THE CONSIDERATIONS RELEVANT TO THEM OF ANY SUCH ELECTION, AND THE IMPACT OF ANY PROPOSED OR FINAL PFIC TREASURY REGULATIONS.
CERTAIN MATERIAL ISRAELI TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Class A Ordinary Shares. You should consult your own tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences that may arise under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction.

Israeli tax considerations 
The following is a brief summary of certain material Israeli income tax laws applicable to Pagaya, and certain Israeli Government programs that may benefit Pagaya. This section also contains a discussion of certain material Israeli tax consequences concerning the ownership and disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares purchased by investors. This summary does not discuss all the aspects of Israeli tax law that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances or to some types of investors subject to special treatment under Israeli law. Examples of such investors include residents of Israel, trusts or traders in securities who are subject to special tax regimes not covered in this discussion. To the extent that the discussion is based on new tax legislation that has not yet been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, Pagaya cannot assure you that the appropriate tax authorities or the courts will accept the views expressed in this discussion. The discussion below is not intended, and should not be construed, as legal or professional tax advice and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. The discussion is subject to change, including due to amendments under Israeli law or changes to the applicable judicial or administrative interpretations of Israeli law, which amendments or changes could affect the tax consequences described below. 
SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE ISRAELI OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF CLASS A ORDINARY SHARES, INCLUDING, IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECT OF ANY NON-U.S., STATE OR LOCAL TAXES. 
General corporate tax structure in Israel 
Israeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income. The corporate tax rate is currently 23%, which has been the rate since 2018. However, the effective tax rate payable by a company that derives income from a Preferred Enterprise or a Technological Enterprise (as discussed below) may be considerably less. Capital gains derived by an Israeli company are generally subject to taxation at the corporate tax rate. 
Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 5729-1969
The Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 5729-1969, generally referred to as the “Industry Encouragement Law”, provides several tax benefits for “Industrial Companies.” We believe that we currently qualify as an Industrial Company within the meaning of the Industry Encouragement Law. 
90
Table of 
Contents
The Industry Encouragement Law defines an “Industrial Company” as an Israeli resident company that derives 90% or more of its income in any tax year, other than income from certain government loans, from an “Industrial Enterprise” owned by it and located in Israel or in the “Area,” in accordance with the definition under Section 3A of the ITO. An “Industrial Enterprise” is defined as an enterprise whose principal activity in a given tax year is industrial production. 
The following are the principal tax benefits available to Industrial Companies:
•
amortization of the cost of purchased patents, rights to use a patent, and know-how, which were purchased in good faith and are used for the development or advancement of the Industrial Enterprise, over an eight-year period, commencing on the year in which such rights were first exercised;
•
under limited conditions, an election to file consolidated tax returns with controlled Israeli Industrial Companies; and
•
expenses related to a public offering are deductible in equal amounts over three years commencing with the year of the offering.
Eligibility for benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not contingent upon approval of any governmental authority. 
Tax benefits and grants for research and development 
Israeli tax law allows, under certain conditions, a tax deduction for expenditures related to scientific research and development projects, including capital expenditures, in the year in which they are incurred. Expenditures are deemed related to scientific research and development projects if:
•
the expenditures are approved by the relevant Israeli government ministry, which depends on the field of research;
•
the research and development must be for the promotion of the company; and
•
the research and development is carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such tax deduction.
The amount of such deductible expenses is reduced by the sum of any funds received through government grants to finance such scientific research and development projects. No deduction under these research and development deduction rules is allowed if the deduction is related to an expense invested in an asset depreciable under the general depreciation rules of the ITO. Expenditures that do not qualify under the conditions above are deductible in equal amounts over three years. 
From time to time, we may apply to the IIA for approval to allow a tax deduction for all or most of the research and development expenses during the year incurred. There can be no assurance that such application will be accepted. If we are not able to deduct research and development expenses during the year of the payment, we may be able to deduct research and development expenses in equal amounts over a period of three years commencing with the year of the payment of such expenses. 
Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959 
The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959, generally referred to as the “Investment Law”, provides certain incentives and tax benefits to eligible companies. Generally, an investment program that is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law, which may be classified as an Approved Enterprise, a Beneficiary Enterprise, a Preferred Enterprise, a Special Preferred Enterprise, a Preferred Technological Enterprise, or a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise, is entitled to benefits as discussed below. These benefits may include cash grants from the Israeli government and tax benefits, based upon, among other things, the geographic location in Israel of the facility of the company. In order to qualify for these incentives, Pagaya is required to comply with the requirements of the Investment Law. 
The Investment Law was significantly amended effective as of April 1, 2005, as of January 1, 2011 and as of January 1, 2017 (the “2017 Amendment”). The 2017 Amendment introduced new benefits for Technological Enterprises, alongside the existing tax benefits. 
New tax benefits under the 2017 Amendment that became effective on January 1, 2017 
The 2017 Amendment provides new tax benefits for two types of “Technological Enterprises,” as described below, which are in addition to the previously existing tax benefit programs under the Investment Law. 
The 2017 Amendment provides that a Preferred Company satisfying certain conditions will qualify as a “Preferred Technological Enterprise” and will thereby enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on income that qualifies as “Preferred Technological Income,” as defined in the Investment Law. The tax rate is further reduced to 7.5% for a Preferred Technological Enterprise located in Development Zone A. In addition, a Preferred Technological Enterprise will enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on capital gains derived from the sale of certain “Benefitted Intangible Assets” (as defined in the Investment Law) to a related foreign company if the Benefitted Intangible Assets were acquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017 for at least NIS 200 million, and the sale receives prior approval from the IIA. It should be noted that the proportion of income that may be considered Preferred Technological Income and enjoy the tax benefits described above is calculated according to a nexus formula, which is based on the proportion of qualifying expenditures on intellectual property compared to overall expenditures.
91
Table of 
Contents
The 2017 Amendment further provides that a Preferred Company with group consolidated revenues of at least NIS 10 billion will qualify as a “Special Preferred Technological Enterprise,” and will enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on “Preferred Technological Income” regardless of the company’s geographic location within Israel. In addition, a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise will enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on capital gains derived from the sale of certain “Benefitted Intangible Assets” to a related foreign company if the Benefitted Intangible Assets were either developed by the Special Preferred Enterprise or acquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017, and the sale received prior approval from the IIA. A Special Preferred Technological Enterprise that acquires Benefitted Intangible Assets from a foreign company for more than NIS 500 million will be eligible for these benefits for at least 10 years, subject to the receipt of certain approvals as specified in the Investment Law. 
Dividends paid out of Preferred Technological Income, which are distributed by a Preferred Technological Enterprise or a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise, are generally subject to tax at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the ITA allowing for a reduced tax rate). However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld. If such dividends are distributed to a foreign company that holds solely or together with other foreign companies 90% or more of the Israeli company and other conditions are met, the tax rate will be 4%. Dividends paid out to individuals may be subject to an additional surtax, as described below. In November 2021, an approval from the ITA was received stating Pagaya is entitled to the tax benefits under the 2017 Amendment, as a Preferred Technological Enterprise (for the tax years 2020 - 2024), subject to certain approvals and subject to certain limitations on the income eligible for such tax benefits. The approval can be extended upon request.
Taxation of our shareholders 
Capital gains tax on sales of our Class A Ordinary Shares 
Israeli law generally imposes a capital gains tax on the sale of any capital assets by Israeli residents, as defined for Israeli tax purposes. Israeli law also generally imposes a capital gains tax on the sale of capital assets located in Israel, including shares in Israeli companies, by both Israeli residents and non-Israeli residents, unless a specific exemption is available or unless a tax treaty between Israel and the shareholder’s country of residence provides otherwise. The ITO distinguishes between real gain and inflationary surplus. The inflationary surplus is a portion of the total capital gain equivalent to the increase of the relevant asset’s purchase price attributable to an increase in the Israeli consumer price index, or, under certain circumstances, a foreign currency exchange rate, between the date of purchase and the date of sale. Inflationary surplus is currently not subject to tax in Israel. The real gain is the excess of the total capital gain over the inflationary surplus. 
Capital gains taxes applicable to Israeli resident shareholders 
An Israeli resident corporation that derives capital gains from the sale of shares in an Israeli resident company will generally be subject to tax on the real capital gains generated on such sale at the corporate tax rate of 23% (in 2025). An Israeli resident individual will generally be subject to capital gains tax at the rate of 25%. However, if the individual shareholder claims deduction of interest expense and linkage differences in connection with the purchase and holding of such shares or is a “substantial shareholder” at the time of the sale or at any time during the preceding 12-month period, such gain will be taxed at the rate of 30%. A “substantial shareholder” is generally a person who alone, or together with such person’s related party or another person who collaborates with such person on a permanent basis, holds, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any of the “means of control” of the corporation. “Means of control” generally include the right to vote, receive profits, nominate a director or an executive officer, receive assets upon liquidation, or order someone who holds any of the aforesaid rights on how to exercise these rights, regardless of the source of such right. Individual holders dealing in securities in Israel for whom the income from the sale of securities is considered “business income” as defined in Section 2(1) of the ITO are taxed at the marginal tax rates applicable to business income (up to 47% in 2025) plus an additional surtax as described below. Certain Israeli institutions that are exempt from tax under Section 9(2) or Section 129C(a)(1) of the ITO (such as exempt trust funds and pension funds) may be exempt from capital gains tax from the sale of the shares. 
Capital gains taxes applicable to non-Israeli resident shareholders 
A non-Israeli resident who derives capital gains from the sale of shares in an Israeli resident company that were purchased after the company was listed for trading on a stock exchange outside of Israel will be exempt from Israeli tax if, among other conditions, the shares were not held through a permanent establishment that the non-resident maintains in Israel. However, non-Israeli corporations will not be entitled to the foregoing exemption if Israeli residents: (i) alone, or together with such Israeli residents’ related party or another person who collaborates with such Israeli resident on a permanent basis, hold, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the means of control in such non-Israeli corporation or (ii) are the beneficiaries of, or are entitled to, 25% or more of the revenues or profits of such non-Israeli corporation, whether directly or indirectly. In addition, such exemption is not applicable to a person whose gains from selling or otherwise disposing of the shares are deemed to be business income. 
Additionally, a sale of securities by a non-Israeli resident may be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty. For example, under the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the 
92
Table of 
Contents
Government of the State of Israel with respect to Taxes on Income, as amended (the “U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty”), the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares by a shareholder who is a United States resident (for purposes of the treaty) holding the shares as a capital asset and who is entitled to claim the benefits afforded to such a resident by the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty (a “U.S. Resident”) is generally exempt from Israeli capital gains tax unless: (i) the capital gain arising from such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to real estate located in Israel; (ii) the capital gain arising from such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to royalties; (iii) the capital gain arising from such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to a permanent establishment in Israel, under certain terms; (iv) such U.S. Resident holds, directly or indirectly, shares representing 10% or more of the company’s voting power during any part of the 12-month period preceding the disposition, subject to certain conditions; or (v) such U.S. Resident is an individual and was present in Israel for 183 days or more during the relevant taxable year. In any such case, the sale, exchange or disposition of our Class A Ordinary Shares by the U.S. Resident would be subject to Israeli tax, unless exempt under Israeli domestic law as described above. However, under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, such U.S. Resident should be permitted to claim a credit for such taxes against U.S. federal income tax imposed on any gain from such sale, exchange or disposition, under the circumstances and subject to the limitations specified in the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty or in the United States federal income tax laws applicable to foreign credits. 
In some instances where our shareholders may be liable for Israeli tax on the sale of their Class A Ordinary Shares, the payment of the consideration may be subject to the withholding of Israeli tax at source. 
Shareholders may be required to demonstrate that they are exempt from tax on their capital gains in order to avoid withholding at source at the time of sale. Specifically, in transactions involving a sale of all of the shares of an Israeli resident company, in the form of a merger or otherwise, the ITA may require shareholders who are not liable for Israeli tax to sign declarations in forms specified by the ITA or to obtain a specific exemption from the ITA to confirm their status as non-Israeli residents, and, in the absence of such declarations or exemptions, may require the purchaser of the shares to withhold taxes at source. 
A detailed return, including a computation of the tax due, must be filed and an advance payment must be paid by January 31 and July 31 of each tax year for sales of securities traded on a stock exchange made during the last six months of the preceding year or during the first six months of the current year, respectively. However, if all tax due was withheld at source according to applicable provisions of the ITO and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the return does not need to be filed provided that (i) such income was not generated from business conducted in Israel by the taxpayer, (ii) the taxpayer has no other taxable sources of income in Israel with respect to which a tax return is required to be filed and an advance payment does not need to be made, and (iii) the taxpayer is not obligated to pay surtax (as further explained below). Capital gains are also reportable on an annual income tax return. 
Taxation of Israeli shareholders on receipt of dividends 
An Israeli resident individual is generally subject to Israeli income tax on the receipt of dividends that may be paid on our Class A Ordinary Shares at the rate of 25%. With respect to a person who is a “substantial shareholder” at the time of receiving the dividend or at any time during the preceding 12-month period, the applicable tax rate is 30%. Individuals may also be required to pay surtax with respect to dividends received, as further explained below. Such dividends are generally subject to Israeli withholding tax at a rate of 25% if the shares are registered with a nominee company (whether the recipient is a substantial shareholder or not) and 20% if the dividend is distributed from income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise or Technological Enterprise. If the recipient of the dividend is an Israeli resident corporation, such dividend income will be exempt from tax provided the income from which such dividend is distributed was derived or accrued within Israel and was received directly or indirectly from another corporation that is subject to Israeli corporate tax. An exempt trust fund, pension fund or other entity that is exempt from tax under Section 9(2) or Section 129(C)(a)(1) of the ITO is exempt from tax on dividends. 
Taxation of non-Israeli shareholders on receipt of dividends 
Non-Israeli residents (either individuals or corporations) are generally subject to Israeli income tax on the receipt of dividends that may be paid on our Class A Ordinary Shares at the rate of 25%, or 30% (plus an additional surtax, if applicable - as further described below) if the recipient of the dividends is a “substantial shareholder” at the time of distribution or at any time during the preceding 12-month period, which tax will be withheld at source, unless relief is provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder’s country of residence. Such dividends are generally subject to Israeli withholding tax at a rate of 25% if the shares are registered with a nominee company (whether the recipient is a substantial shareholder or not). The withholding rates may be reduced if the dividend is distributed from income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise or Technological Enterprise or if a reduced rate is provided under an applicable tax treaty, in each case subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the ITA allowing for a reduced withholding rate. For example, under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends paid to a holder of our Class A Ordinary Shares who is a U.S. Resident is 25%. However, the maximum withholding tax rate on dividends (not generated by a Preferred Technological Enterprise) that are paid to a United States corporation holding shares representing 10% or more of our outstanding voting power throughout the tax year in which the dividend is distributed as well as during the previous tax year is generally 12.5%, provided that not more than 25% of the gross income for such preceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends distributed from income attributed to a Preferred Technological Enterprise are not entitled to such reduction under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty but are subject to a withholding tax rate of 15% for a shareholder that is a U.S. corporation, provided that the 
93
Table of 
Contents
conditions related to the outstanding voting rights and the gross income for the previous year (as set forth in the previous sentences) are met. If the dividend is attributable partly to income derived from a Preferred Technological Enterprise, and partly to other sources of income, the withholding rate will be a blended rate reflecting the relative portions of the two types of income. We cannot assure you that we will designate the profits that we may distribute in a way that will reduce shareholders’ tax liability.

A foreign resident who had income from a dividend that was accrued from Israeli source, from which the full tax was deducted, will generally be exempt from filing a tax return in Israel, provided that (i) such income was not generated from business conducted in Israel by the foreign resident, (ii) the foreign resident has no other taxable sources of income in Israel with respect to which a tax return is required to be filed and (iii) the foreign resident is not liable to surtax (see below) in accordance with Section 121B of the ITO. 
Surtax 
Subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty, individuals who are subject to tax in Israel (whether or not any such individual is an Israeli resident) are also subject to a surtax at the rate of 3% on annual income (including, but not limited to, dividends, interest and capital gains) exceeding NIS 721,560 for 2025, which amount is linked to the annual change in the Israeli consumer price index. Starting in 2025, a new law amendment introduces an additional 2% surtax specifically for capital resources above this threshold. In summary, Income from dividends, interest, real estate sales, and other capital sources exceeding NIS 721,560 will now incur a total surtax of 5%.
Estate and Gift Tax 
Israeli law presently does not impose estate or gift taxes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of PAGAYA TECHNOLOGIES LTD.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pagaya technologies Ltd (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in redeemable convertible preferred shares and shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PAGAYA TECHNOLOGIES LTD.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
NOTE 1 - 
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION  
Pagaya Technologies Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries (together “we” “our” “Pagaya” or the “Company”) is a technology company that deploys sophisticated data science and proprietary AI technology to drive better results for financial services and other service providers, their customers, and asset investors. Services providers integrated with Pagaya’s network, which are referred to as “Partners,” range from high-growth financial technology companies to incumbent banks and financial institutions, auto finance providers and residential real estate service providers. Partners have access to Pagaya’s network in order to assist with extending financial products to their customers, in turn helping those customers fulfill their financial needs and dreams. These assets originated by Partners with the assistance of Pagaya’s AI technology are eligible to be acquired by (i) funds managed or advised by Pagaya or one of its affiliates, (ii) securitization vehicles sponsored or administered by Pagaya or one of its affiliates and (iii) other similar vehicles (“Financing Vehicles”).
Pagaya Technologies Ltd. was founded in 2016 and is organized under the laws of the State of Israel. Pagaya has its primary offices in Israel and the United States.
Reverse Share Split
Share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the 1-for-12 reverse share split effected on March 8, 2024.
NOTE 2 - 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) if any.

All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Variable Interest Entities
A VIE is a legal entity that has a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The Company’s variable interest arises from contractual ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, which may change with fluctuations in the fair value of the VIE’s net assets. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company consolidates a VIE when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at initial involvement and on an ongoing basis.
 Refer to Note 8 for additional information. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which Management believes are critical in understanding and evaluating the Company’s reported financial results include, but are not limited to the valuation of certain financial instruments and allowance for credit losses. The Company bases its estimates or assumptions on various factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.

Segment Reporting 
F-9
Table of 
Contents
Excluding Darwin Homes, Inc. (“Darwin”) (see Note 3) which was determined to be an immaterial reportable segment, the Company manages its operations and allocates resources as a single operating segment. Further, the Company manages, monitors and reports its financials as a single reporting segment. The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is its Chief Executive Officer who makes operating decisions, assesses financial performance and allocates resources based on consolidated financial information. As such, the Company has determined that it operates in 
one
 reportable segment.

Foreign Currency 
The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which Pagaya’s operations are conducted. The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are accordingly remeasured into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period in accordance with Statement of the Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) No. 830 “Foreign Currency Matters” (“ASC No. 830”). All transaction gains and losses of the remeasured monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the Statements of Operations within other expenses, net, as appropriate.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded $
4.2
 million losses and $
1.3
 million gains, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of checking, money market and savings accounts held at financial institutions or highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at carrying value, which approximates fair value. 
Restricted cash consists primarily of: (i) deposits restricted by standby letters of credit for lease facilities; and (ii) funds held in accounts as collateral for certain guarantees that the Company provide within the ordinary course of business, including certain securitization transactions. The Company has no ability to draw on such funds as long as the funds remain restricted under the applicable agreements.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flow (in thousands):

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and fees receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are principally maintained with major financial institutions, which management assesses to be of high credit quality. The Company has not experienced any losses on these deposits.
The Company’s fees receivable balances are predominantly with agreements with customers, and these are subject to normal credit risks which management believes to be not significant.

Significant customers are those which represent 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue for each respective period presented. One customer individually represented greater than 10% of total revenue and collectively totaled approximately 
13
% and 
11
% for year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, three related parties individually represented greater than 10% of total revenue and collectively totaled approximately 
42
%.
Fair Value Measurement 
ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. In general, fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, when available. If such 
F-10
Table of 
Contents
quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters to the greatest extent possible. 
Additionally, ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy to categorize the use of inputs into the following three levels: 
Level 1
—Quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
Level 2
—Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets and include 1) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, 2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and 3) or inputs that are derived principally from or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
Level 3
—Pricing inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
Management believes that the carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, fees receivable, accounts payables, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Investments in Loans and Securities 
A wholly-owned subsidiary (“Sponsor”) previously sponsors securitization transactions (the “Securitizations”), each through a separate trust structure with an asset portfolio consisting of unsecured consumer loans, auto loans or real estate assets. Each Securitization’s asset portfolio was structured by the Sponsor, which is also the administrator of each Securitization. The Sponsor, directly and indirectly through affiliates, retained at least 5% of the economic risk in the Securitizations to comply with risk retention required by Title 17 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 246, Credit Risk Retention, promulgated by Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Investments in Loans and Securities Available for Sale
Investments in loans and securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest or prepayment rates, needs for liquidity, and changes in the availability and the yield of alternative investments will be classified as available for sale (“AFS”). These investments are carried at fair value estimated using the following when available: public market prices, dealer quotes, and prices obtained from independent pricing services that may be derivable from observable and unobservable market inputs. The Company’s fair value estimate is based on an internal discounted cash flow model. On January 1, 2023, the Company transferred all of its investment securities classified as held-to-maturity to available for sale. 
These investments are held at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on securities available for sale, net within other comprehensive income (loss), excluding the portion relating to any credit loss. As of the end of each reporting period, management reviews each security where the fair value is less than the amortized cost to determine whether any portion of the decline in fair value is due to a credit loss and/or whether or not we intend to sell or will be required to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The portion of any decline in fair value which management identifies as a credit loss will be recognized as an allowance for credit losses through other expenses, net. To the extent management intends to sell or may be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, the Company (1) reverses any previously recorded allowance for credit losses with an offsetting entry to reduce the amortized cost basis of the security and (2) writes-off any remaining portion of the amortized cost basis to equal its fair value, with this change recorded through other expenses, net. See Note 7 for additional information.
Impaired loans and investments are classified as non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans and investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.
Loans Held for Investment

Loans held for investment are recorded at amortized cost, less an allowance for potential uncollectible amounts. Amortized cost basis represents principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income, premiums or discounts on purchased loans and charge-offs. The Company’s intent and ability to designate loans as held for investment in the future may change based on changes in business strategies, the economic environment, and market conditions.
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company held $
13.8
 million of loans held for investment, all of which were transferred to available for sale on January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
,
 the Company did 
not
 have any loans classified as held for investment.
Equity Method and Other Investments 
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in entities that the Company does not control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is recorded as investment income or loss on the consolidated statements of operations. Distributions received from the investment reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investee. 
The Company elected to account for its equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The investments are reviewed periodically to determine if their respective values have appreciated or have been impaired, and adjustments are recorded as necessary.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a loss of $
4.6
 million and income of $
0.5
 million and $
5.8
 million, respectively, related to revaluation of its investments in privately held companies. See Note 7 for additional information. 
The following investments, including those accounted for under the equity method, are included within Equity method and other investments in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

Property and Equipment, Net 
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
Useful lives by asset category are as follows: 
Computer and software
3
 to 
7
 years
Furniture and equipment
3
 to 
7
 years
Internal-use software
2
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of remaining lease term or estimated useful life
Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are expensed as incurred. Major replacements, improvements and additions are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of property and equipment, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the consolidated financial statements, with any resulting gain or loss included in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Property and equipment is tested for impairment when there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Carrying values are not recoverable when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are 
F-12
Table of 
Contents
less than their carrying values. When an asset is determined not to be recoverable, the impairment is measured based on the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the asset over its respective fair value and recorded in the period the determination is made.

Internal-Use Software 
Internally developed software is capitalized upon completion of the preliminary project stage, when it becomes probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Capitalized costs primarily consist of salaries and payroll related costs for employees directly involved in development efforts. Costs related to the preliminary project stage and activities occurring after the implementation of the software are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for software upgrades are capitalized if they result in additional functionalities or substantial enhancements. Capitalized internal-use software is included in property and equipment, net, in the consolidated balance sheets, and amortization expense is included in technology, data and product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company reviews on a regular basis list of projects that are in process and if the project is to be abandoned or discontinued the capitalized costs associated with that project are expensed immediately.
 In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded impairment of capitalized software in the amount of $
3.2
 million, $
2.5
 million

and $
3.2
 million, respectively.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of the identified net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. Impairment of goodwill is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company may assess goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach, referred to as “step zero”, to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis will be performed to determine if there is any impairment. The Company may alternatively elect to initially perform a quantitative assessment and bypass the qualitative assessment. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Therefore, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. The Company’s annual impairment testing date is October 1.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The Company's long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment,” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include any significant changes in the manner of the Company's use of the assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. Upon determination that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon a comparison of aggregate undiscounted projected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value.
See Note 3 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets, including those recognized in connection with recent business combinations. 
Warrants

The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether the warrants meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. 
This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 
F-13
Table of 
Contents
For warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash other income or expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue Recognition 
The Company’s revenue consists of 
two
 components: revenue from fees and revenue from other income, which is comprised of interest income and investment income. 
The amount of revenue from fees recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for services provided. The Company applied the following five steps: 
1. Identification of the contract with the customer: 
The Company determines a contract with a customer exists when each party’s rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, a conclusion has been reached that the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. 
2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract: 
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable, whereby the customer can benefit from the services. 
3. Determination of the transaction price: 
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract. 
4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: 
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation. 
5. Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied: 
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised delivery of service to the customer.  
See Note 4 for additional information.
Interest Income 
Interest income is recognized based on projected cashflow according to the ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. The Company accrues interest income on investments based on the effective interest rate of the investments and recorded as interest income as earned. Interest income also includes accrued interest earned on outstanding investments in loans and securities. Loans and securities with an allowance for credit losses that have reached a delinquency of over 90 days or more and if management has doubts about collectability are classified as non-accrual status. The Company records an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. Non-accrual loans and investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded $
13.7
 million and $
12.5
 million of accrued interest income in fees and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Interest income earned from cash and cash equivalents is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent such interest is earned and expected to be collected.

Production Costs
Production costs are primarily comprised of (i) fees the Company incurs to Partners when network volume is acquired by Financing Vehicles as the Partners are responsible for marketing and customer interaction, facilitating the flow of additional application flow, and (ii) expenses the Company incurs to renovate single-family rental properties.
F-14
Table of 
Contents
Technology, Data and Product Development Costs
Technology, data and product development costs are primarily engineering and product development expenses which primarily consists of payroll and other employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, for the engineering and product development teams as well the costs of systems and tools used by these teams. These costs, net of amounts capitalized, are recognized in the period incurred. The capitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line method over the estimated useful life in technology, data and product development costs.
Leases 
The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases. Under this guidance, lessees classify arrangements meeting the definition of a lease as operating or financing leases, and leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses, including insurance and property tax, are recorded when incurred. The Company accounts for any subleases on a gross basis with sublease income presented in Other expenses, net on the consolidated statement of operations.  
In calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less as an accounting policy election, and instead recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-Based Compensation 
The Company grants options to employees and nonemployees. The Company measures options based on the estimated grant date fair values, which the Company determines using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company measures the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. The Company records the resulting expense in the consolidated Statements of Operations using the straight-line method over the period of service required to vest in the award, which is generally 
two
 to 
four years
. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. 
The Company also grants options to restricted shares to certain employees and directors. The Company measures options to restricted shares based on the estimated grant date fair values, which the Company determines using the Monte Carlo simulation model implemented in a risk-neutral valuation framework. The Company records the resulting expense in the consolidated Statements of Operations using the straight-line method over the period of service required to vest in the award, which is generally 
two
 to 
four years
. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Income Taxes 
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income when the differences are expected to reverse. 
The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented under non-current assets and liabilities, respectively. 
ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized (1) when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent (on a cumulative basis) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 
F-15
Table of 
Contents
The Company records unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjusts these liabilities when management’s judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from management’s current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Ordinary Share 
The Company calculates net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders for the period to be allocated between ordinary shares and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. 
The Company’s redeemable convertible preferred shares contractually entitle the holders of such shares to participate in distribution but does not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses. Accordingly, for the periods where the Company is in a net loss position, the Company does not allocate any net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders to the redeemable convertible preferred shares. 
The Company calculates basic net income (loss) per share attributable to ordinary shareholders by dividing net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. 
The Company calculates diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to ordinary shareholders by dividing net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of the redeemable convertible preferred shares, share options, and preferred shares warrants that are outstanding during the period.

Noncontrolling Interests
The consolidated financial statements included the Company's accounts and the accounts of the Company's consolidated entities. Non-controlling interest positions of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to the Company’s shareholders.
Comprehensive Income
The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 220, "Comprehensive Income". Comprehensive income generally represents all changes in shareholders' equity during the period except those resulting from investments by, or distributions to, shareholders. The Company determined that its items of other comprehensive income relate to gains and losses on unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity,” which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Merger with EJF Acquisition Corp

On June 22, 2022 (the “EJFA Closing Date”), the Company consummated the previously announced business combination pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 15, 2021 (the “EJFA Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, EJF Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“EJFA”), and Rigel Merger Sub Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“EJFA Merger Sub”).
On the EJFA Closing Date, the following transactions occurred pursuant to the terms of the EJFA Merger Agreement:

•
(i) immediately prior to the effective time (the “Effective Time”) of the EJFA Merger (as defined below), each preferred share, with nominal value New Israeli Shekel 
0.01
, of Pagaya (each, a “Pagaya Preferred Share”) was converted into ordinary shares, with no par value, of Pagaya (each, a “Pagaya Ordinary Share”) in accordance with Pagaya’s organizational documents (the “Conversion”), (ii) immediately following the Conversion but prior to the Effective Time, Pagaya adopted amended and restated articles of association of Pagaya, (iii) immediately following such adoption but prior to the Effective Time, Pagaya effected a stock split of each Pagaya Ordinary Share and each Pagaya Ordinary Share underlying any outstanding options to acquire Pagaya Ordinary Shares, whether vested or unvested, into such number of Pagaya Ordinary Shares calculated in accordance with the terms of the EJFA Merger Agreement such that each Pagaya Ordinary Share has a value of $
120.00
 per share after giving effect to such stock split (the “Stock Split”), with the 
three
 founders of Pagaya (including any trusts the beneficiary of which is a founder of Pagaya and to the extent that a founder of Pagaya has the right to vote the shares held by such trust) (in their capacity as shareholders of Pagaya, the “Founders”) each receiving Class B ordinary shares of Pagaya, without par value (the “Pagaya Class B Ordinary Shares”), which carry voting rights in the form of ten (
10
) votes per share of Pagaya, and the other shareholders of Pagaya receiving Class A ordinary shares of Pagaya, without par value (the “Pagaya Class A Ordinary Shares”), which are economically equivalent to the Pagaya Class B Ordinary Shares and carry voting rights in the form of one (
1
) vote per share of Pagaya, in accordance with Pagaya’s organizational documents (the “Reclassification” and, together with the Conversion and the Stock Split, the “Capital Restructuring”);
•
at the Effective Time, EJFA Merger Sub merged with and into EJFA (the “EJFA Merger”), with EJFA continuing as the surviving company after the EJFA Merger (the “Surviving Company”), and, as a result of the EJFA Merger, the Surviving Company became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Pagaya; and

•
at the Effective Time, (i) each Class B ordinary share, par value $
0.0001
 per share, of EJFA (the “EJFA Class B Ordinary Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than all shares of EJFA held by EJFA, EJFA Merger Sub or Pagaya or any of its subsidiaries at that time (such shares, the “Excluded Shares”), was no longer outstanding and was converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive 
one
 Pagaya Class A Ordinary Share after giving effect to the Capital Restructuring, (ii) each Class A ordinary share, par value $
0.0001
 per share, of EJFA (the “EJFA Class A Ordinary Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than the Excluded Shares was no longer outstanding and was converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive 
one
 Pagaya Class A Ordinary Share after giving effect to the Capital Restructuring, (iii) each issued and outstanding warrant of EJFA sold to the public and to Wilson Boulevard LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in a private placement in connection with EJFA’s initial public offering (the “EJFA Warrants”) was automatically and irrevocably assumed by Pagaya and converted into a corresponding warrant exercisable for Pagaya Class A Ordinary Shares (“Pagaya Warrants”).
The warrants acquired in the EJFA Merger include (a) redeemable warrants issued by EJFA and sold as part of the units in the EJFA IPO (whether they were purchased in the EJFA IPO or thereafter in the open market), which are exercisable for an aggregate of 
798,611
 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $
138
 per share (the “EJFA Public Warrants”) and (b) warrants issued by EJFA to Wilson Boulevard LLC in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of the EJFA IPO, which are exercisable for an aggregate of 
430,555
 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $

The EJFA Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Pagaya has been determined to be the accounting acquirer, primarily due to the fact that Pagaya Shareholders will continue to control the post-Closing combined company.
On the EJFA Closing Date, simultaneous with the closing of the EJFA Merger, the Company completed a PIPE financing whereby the Company received $
350
 million gross proceeds in exchange for 
2,916,666
 shares of common stock.
Total gross proceeds resulting from the transactions were $
350
 million, out of which total transaction costs amounted to approximately $
57.3
 million. The transaction costs allocated to the warrants liabilities in the amount of $
1.2
 million were recognized as expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. 
In connection with the EJFA Merger, the Company’s board of directors approved a 1:186.9 stock split and a change in par value from NIS 
0.01
 to no par value. As a result, all shares, options, warrants, exercise price and net loss per share amounts were adjusted retroactively for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements as if the stock split and change in par value had been in effect as of the date of these consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition of Darwin Homes, Inc.
On January 5, 2023 (“Darwin acquisition date”), the Company completed the acquisition of Darwin Homes, Inc. (“Darwin”), a leading real estate investment management platform based in Austin, Texas that offers a comprehensive, tech-enabled solution for acquiring, renovating, and managing single-family rental properties. Darwin is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the results of Darwin for the period from January 5, 2023 to December 31, 2023 are included in the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the acquisition was not material to the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
The Company acquired 
100
% of Darwin’s equity through an all-stock transaction with a market value of approximately $
18
 million as of the Darwin acquisition date. In addition to the purchase consideration, the Company also granted approximately $
12
 million of cash and equity awards to Darwin employees which are recognized as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. Acquisition related costs of $
0.1
 million were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. 
Darwin Net Assets Acquired
The assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of the Darwin acquisition date. Total assets acquired included identified intangible assets of $
5.1
 million. The Company recognized an asset for goodwill, determined as the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, that amounted to $
10.9
 million. Goodwill generated from this business combination is attributed to synergies between the Company's and Darwin's respective products and services.

Identified intangible assets in the table above are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The Company believes that the straight-line method of amortization is the most appropriate methodology as it is supported by the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed.
Acquisition of Theorem Technology, Inc.
On October 22, 2024 (“Theorem acquisition date”), the Company completed the acquisition of Theorem Technology, Inc. (“Theorem”), a Silicon Valley-based institutional asset manager focused exclusively on the consumer credit space, managing assets for global institutional investors since its founding in 2014. Theorem is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the results of Theorem for the period from October 22, 2024 to December 31, 2024 are included in the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
The Company acquired 
100
% of Theorem’s equity for approximately $
17.5
 million, consisting of $
10.0
 million cash and 
504,440
 of the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares (valued at $
7.5
 million as of the closing date), with an additional estimated contingent consideration at fair value of $
6.1
 million

to be paid in cash and/or the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares based on achievement of certain performance objectives defined in the purchase agreement. Contingent consideration will be remeasured through the consolidated statement of operations over the 1-year performance period. As the transaction has closed recently, the purchase accounting has not yet been completed. Acquisition related costs of $
0.1
 million were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
Theorem Net Assets Acquired
The assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of the Theorem acquisition date. Total assets acquired included identified intangible assets of $
8.3
 million. The Company recognized an asset for goodwill of $
12.1
 million, determined as the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill generated from this business combination is attributed to synergies between the Company's and Theorem's respective products and services. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
An assessment of the fair value of identified intangible assets and their respective lives as of the acquisition date are as follows:

NOTE 4 - 
REVENUE
Revenue from fees is comprised of Network AI fees and Contract fees. Network AI fees can be further broken down into 
two
 fee streams: AI integration fees and capital markets execution fees. AI integration fees are earned for the creation and delivery of assets that comprise Network Volume. The Company utilizes multiple funding channels to enable the purchase of network assets 
F-19
Table of

from Partners, such as asset backed securitizations (“ABS”), forward flow agreements etc. Capital markets execution fees are earned from the market pricing of ABS transactions while contract fees are management, performance and similar fees. These fees are the result of agreements with customers and are recognized in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). 
Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 with revenue recorded on a gross basis when the Company is a principal in the transaction with customers, and recorded on a net basis when the Company is acting as an agent on behalf of another. The Company generally recognizes revenue on a gross basis because the Company is primarily responsible for integrating the various services fulfilled by Partners and is ultimately responsible to the Financing Vehicles for the fulfillment of the related services. To the extent the Company does not meet the criteria for recognizing revenue on a gross basis, the Company records revenue on a net basis. 
Network AI Fees
Network AI fees, comprised of AI integration fees and capital markets execution fees, totaled $
916.1
 million, $
696.0
 million and $
599.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recognizes Network AI fees primarily at a point in time when the related performance obligation is satisfied and the payment term is generally 30 days. From time to time the Company may provide certain incentives to Financing Vehicles. When the Company determines that an incentive is consideration payable, which is not in exchange for distinct goods or services, to a customer, the incentive is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Expenses to third parties for services that are integrated with the Company’s technology are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as Production Costs.
Contract Fees
Contract fees include administration and management fees, performances fees, and servicing fees. Contract fees totaled $
88.5
 million, $
76.8
 million and $
86.4
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recognizes administration fees over the service period for the Financing Vehicles managed or administered by the Company and the payment term is based on contract terms.
Performance fees are earned when certain Fund Financing Vehicles exceed contractual return thresholds. They are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. An estimate is made by the Company based on a variety of factors including market conditions and expected loan performance. In the following period, the true performance is measured and then adjusted to ensure that the fees accurately represent actual performance of Financing Vehicles. As such, there are revenues that result from performance obligations satisfied in the previous year. During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
2.5
 million and $
3.6
 million, respectively, worth of fees represent performance obligations satisfied in 2023 and 2022 that were greater than the original estimate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $
3.8
 million worth of fees represent performance obligations satisfied in the previous year that were lesser than the original estimate. The payment term is based on contract terms.
Servicing fees for the Financing Vehicles, which primarily involve collecting payments and providing reporting on the loans within the securitization vehicles, are recognized over the service period and the payment term is based on contract terms. These duties have been considered to be agent responsibilities and does not include acting as a loan servicer. Accordingly, servicing fees are recorded on a net basis. 
Total Revenue From Fees
The Company determines its contracts generally to not include a significant financing component since the Company's selling prices are not subjected to billing terms nor is its purpose to receive financing from its customers or to provide customers with financing. In addition, as a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between payment and the transfer of services is expected to be one year or less. 
Once revenue is recognized, it is recorded on the balance sheet in fees and other receivables until the payment is received from the customer. The timing of the recognition depends on the type of service as described above.

Risk Retention Master Repurchase 
In normal course of business, the Company, through consolidated VIEs, enters into repurchase agreements to finance the Company’s risk retention balance in notes and certificates retained from securitization transactions. Under these agreements, the Company pledges financial instruments as collateral. These agreements with counterparties generally contain contractual provisions allowing the counterparty the right to sell or repledge the collateral. Pledged securities owned that can be sold or repledge by the counterparty are included in Investments in loans and securities in our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the repurchase agreements was $
144.0
 million and $
251.4

Receivables Facility
In October 2022, Pagaya Receivables LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “LSA Agreement”) with certain lenders, which provides for a 
3-year
 loan facility (the “Receivables Facility”) in a maximum principal amount of $
22
 million to finance certain eligible receivables purchased from sponsored securitization transactions. In June 2023, the Company amended the agreement and increased the maximum principal amount by $
10
 million to $
32
 million. In June 2024, the Company amended the agreement pursuant to which the maximum principal amount was increased from $
32
 million to $
45
 million and the term was extended until June 2026. Borrowings under the Receivables Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (subject to a 
0.00
% floor) plus a margin of 
3.50
%, and the balance is repaid using cash proceeds received from the receivables. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the Receivables Facility was $
31.9
 million and $
20.3
 million, respectively, which is recorded within secured borrowing on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Credit Agreement
On February 2, 2024, the Company entered into a certain Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a 
5-year
 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an initial principal amount of $
25
 million, which subsequently increased to $
35
 million, and a 
5
 year senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility,” and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Facilities”) in an initial principal amount of $
255
 million. 
In November 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company incurred incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $
100
 million, bringing the total principal amount of the Term Loan Facility to $
355
 million. The Company also increased an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility of $
15
 million, bringing the total principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility to $
50
 million. In February 2025, the Company further increased the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility by $
8
 million, resulting in a total principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility of $
58
 million. 
The Facilities replace the SVB Revolving Credit Facility with proceeds of borrowings under the Facilities allowed to be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
No amortization payments are required to be made in respect of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Amortization payments are required to be made in respect of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility in amount of 
1.25
% per quarter of the original principal amount of the term loans under the Term Loan Facility.
Borrowings under the Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, (i) a base rate (determined based on the prime rate and subject to a 
2.00
% floor) plus a margin of 
6.50
% or (ii) an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (subject to a 
1.00
% floor) plus a margin of 
7.50
%. A commitment fee accrues on any unused portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum of 
0.25
% and is payable quarterly in arrears. Accrued interest of $
2.8
 million was recorded within accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an outstanding balance of $

Exchangeable Senior Notes
On October 1, 2024, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $
160
 million aggregate principal amount of its 
6.125
% Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Notes”) due 2029. The issuance was in connection with a purchase agreement dated September 26, 2024, with certain initial purchasers. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 
6.125
% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2025. The Notes will mature on October 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or exchanged.
The exchange rate will initially be 71.4669 Class A Ordinary Shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $
13.99
 per Class A Ordinary Share). The exchange rate is subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate for Notes exchanged during a specified period of time.
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations described below), at the option of the Company at any time, and from time to time, on or after October 5, 2027 and on or before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if (i) the notes are “freely tradable” (as defined in the Indenture), and all accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any, has been paid in full as of the first interest payment date occurring on or before the related “redemption notice date” (as defined in the Indenture); and (ii) the last reported sale price per Class A Ordinary Share exceeds 
130
% of the exchange price on (1) each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the related redemption notice date; and (2) the trading day immediately before the redemption notice date. However, the Company may not redeem less than all of the outstanding Notes unless at least $
50.0
 million aggregate principal amount of Notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the related Redemption Notice Date. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such Note called for redemption, in which case the exchange rate applicable to the exchange of such Note called for redemption will be increased in certain circumstances if it is exchanged during the related “redemption exchange period” (as defined in the Indenture).
If the Company undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions and except as set forth in the Indenture, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The Company accounted for the issuance of the Notes as a single liability at par as the conversion feature does not require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC 815 and the Notes were not issued at a substantial premium. Debt issuance costs related to the Notes totaled $
6.2
 million and consisted of underwriting fees and third-party offering costs, which are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. The Company recorded $
3.1
 million of interest expense, including $
0.6
 million of amortization of debt issuance costs, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The effective interest rate of the Notes is 
8.7
%.
The estimated fair value of the Notes as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $
163.4
 million, which represent Level 2 valuations in the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value was determined based on the estimated or actual bids and offers of the Notes in an over-the-counter market. The carrying value of the Notes as of December 31, 2024 was $
146.3
 million.

NOTE 8 - 
CONSOLIDATION AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
The Company has variable interests in securitization vehicles that it sponsors. The Company consolidates VIEs when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. In order to be primary beneficiary, the Company must have a controlling financial interest in the VIE. This is determined by evaluating if the Company has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. 
Consolidated VIEs
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of Pagaya Structured Holdings LLC, Pagaya Structured Holdings II LLC, and Pagaya Structured Holding III LLC (“Risk Retention Entities”). As sponsor of securitization transactions, the Company is subject to risk retention requirements and established the Risk Retention Entities to meet these requirements. 
Below is a summary of assets and liabilities from the Company’s involvement with consolidated VIEs (i.e., Risk Retention Entities) (in thousands):

Unconsolidated VIEs

The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts which hold the loans and issue securities associated with the securitization transactions the Company sponsors. The Company does not have the power to direct or control the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the trusts, which was determined to be servicing loans. 
The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from its involvement with unconsolidated VIEs represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for which the Company believes the possibility is remote, such as where the value of securitization notes and senior and residual certificates the Company holds as part of the risk retention requirement declines to zero.

NOTE 11 - 
WARRANT LIABILITY
Following the 1-for-12 reverse share split effective March 2024, each warrant entitles the holder to purchase 1/12 of a Class A Ordinary Share (or equivalently, 12 warrants are required to obtain 1 Class A Ordinary Share), and the redemption trigger prices described below have been adjusted accordingly. 
Public Warrants — 
Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. The Public Warrants became exercisable on July 22, 2022. The Public Warrants will expire on June 22, 2027 or upon liquidation.
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares, no par value (“Class A Ordinary Shares”), of the Company pursuant to the exercise of a public warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No public warrant will be exercisable, and the Company will not be obligated to issue a Class A Ordinary Share upon exercise of a public warrant unless the Class A Ordinary Share, issuable upon such warrant exercise, has been registered, qualified, or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the public warrants. 
Redemption of Public Warrants for Cash 
The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants: 
•
if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $
216.00
 per share (as adjusted for the reverse share split) for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
 trading day period ending 
three
 business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders;
•
in whole and not in part; 
•
at a price of $
0.01
 per warrant; and 
•
upon not less than 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder.
If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.
Redemption of Public Warrants when the per share price of Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $
120.00
The Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:
•
if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $
120.00
 per share (as adjusted for the reverse share split) for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
 trading-day period ending on, and including, the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders;
•
in whole and not in part; and
•
for cash at a price of at $
0.10
 per warrant upon a minimum of 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption; provided that holders will be able to exercise their public warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table included in the Warrant Agreement, based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of the Class A Ordinary Shares as described in the Warrant Agreement.
F-29
Table of 
Contents
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption as described above under “
—Redemption of Public Warrants for Cash,
” management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the Warrant Agreement. The exercise price and number of Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Class A Ordinary Shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net-cash settle the warrants. 
Private Placement Warrants — 
Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable for cash or cashless, at the holder’s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
These warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The warrant liability is measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within other expenses, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company used the value of the Public Warrants as an approximation of the value of the Private Warrants as they are substantially similar to the Public Warrants, but not directly traded or quoted on an active market.

NOTE 12 - 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Legal Proceedings 
— From time to time the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The results of such matters often cannot be predicted with certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrued liability for legal proceeding and claims when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable. All such liabilities arising from current legal and regulatory matters, to the extent such matters existed, have been recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and these matters are immaterial. 
Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
— During 2023 the Company entered into a purchase commitment with our third-party cloud computing web services provider, which included an annual purchase commitment of $
8.5
 million for the period from October 2023 through September 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the total remaining contractual obligations are approximately $
3.6
 million, all of which is for the next 12 months. We may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment based on usage. 
In October 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Theorem. See Note 3 for additional information regarding the transaction, including establishment of $
6.1
 million of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration liability is reported at fair value, which is determined based on the present value of an expected payment under the arrangement, using an option pricing model based on a number of assumptions, including certain unobservable assumptions discounted at an estimated market interest rate. The fair value of the liability is updated each reporting period, with changes in fair value reported within “Other expenses, net.” The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was $
6.1
 million as of December 31, 2024. 
Guarantees and Indemnifications 
—

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications or loss guarantees of varying scope and terms to customers and other third parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnifications may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future indemnification payments may not be subject to a cap. As of December 31, 2024, there have been no known events or circumstances that have resulted in a material indemnification liability and the Company did not incur material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications. For certain contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee or a derivative, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments the Company could be required to make under these guarantees totaled $
35.0
 million. In accordance with the guarantee contracts, the maximum potential payment amount has been segregated and recognized within restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet.

NOTE 14 - 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. In general, fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, when available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters to the greatest extent possible. 
Financial Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value
The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands):

Ordinary Share Warrants 
F-34
Table of 
Contents
The Company has accounted for the ordinary share warrants as equity-classified warrants as they met the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the ordinary share warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares. For warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and remeasured each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash other income or expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
433,942
 warrants expiring in March 2031 with an exercise price of $
0.00006

Ordinary Shares Purchase Agreement 
On August 17, 2022, the Company entered into an ordinary shares purchase agreement (the “Equity Financing Purchase Agreement”) and a registration rights agreement (the “Equity Financing Registration Rights Agreement”) with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC (“B. Riley Principal Capital II”). Pursuant to the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II, up to $
300,000,000
 of newly issued shares of the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares from time to time during the 
24-month
 term of the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement. Sales of Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, and the timing of any sales, are solely at the option of the Company, and the Company is under no obligation to sell any securities to B. Riley Principal Capital II under the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement. 
The per share purchase price for the shares of Class A Ordinary Shares that the Company elects to sell to B. Riley Principal Capital II in a Purchase pursuant to the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, if any, will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average price of the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares as defined within the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, less a fixed 
3
% discount. The Company cannot issue to B. Riley Principal Capital II more than 
3,344,967
 shares of Class A Ordinary Shares, which number of shares is approximately 
9
% of outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the execution of the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement.
The net proceeds under the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells shares of its stock to B. Riley Principal Capital II. 
As consideration for B. Riley Principal Capital II’s commitment to purchase shares of Class A Ordinary Shares at the Company’s direction upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, upon execution of the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 
3,878
 shares of Class A Ordinary Shares to B. Riley Principal Capital II. Expense of $
1
 million related to these shares was recognized within other income (loss), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 
814,569
 shares were issued under the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of $
11.9
 million, and related fee of $
0.4
 million was expensed. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 
1,587,157
 shares were issued under the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of $
27.2
 million, and related fee of $
0.7
 million was expensed. The Company terminated the Equity Financing Purchase Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Amended Letter Agreement
Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, dated June 1, 2020, the Company agreed to provide Radiance Star Pte. Ltd. (“Radiance”), an affiliate of GIC Private Limited, the right to purchase up to a certain amount of qualified securities in certain offerings by the Company and to provide Radiance with notice of any fund offerings or securitization offerings. On March 19, 2023, the Company and Radiance agreed to extend the term of the Letter Agreement by 
three years
 (the “Amended Letter Agreement”) to June 1, 2028 on the same terms and amount, including the issuance of 
220,000
 warrants to purchase Class A Ordinary shares at an exercise price of $
0.12
 that vest annually beginning from June 1, 2025 if certain investment thresholds by Radiance are met. There were no other material changes to the existing terms of the Letter Agreement.
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares
F-35
Table of 
Contents
In May 2023, the Company issued 
5,000,000
 Preferred Shares at $
15.00
 per share (the “Original Issue Price”) to Oak HC/FT Partners V, L.P., Oak HC/FT Partners V-A, L.P. and Oak HC/FT Partners V-B, L.P for gross total proceeds of $
75
 million. For accounting purposes, upon issuance of the Preferred Share, the Company recorded $
74.25
 million ($
75
 million net of direct offering costs of $
0.75
 million) as mezzanine equity (temporary equity) on the consolidated balance sheets because it is contingently redeemable outside of the control of the Company.  
The terms and preferences of the preferred shares are summarized as follows:
Conversion Features
Each one Preferred Share shall be convertible into 
one
 Class A Ordinary Share at the option of the holder thereof, at any time. 
At any time on or after the 
six
th anniversary of the issuance of the Preferred Shares, if the Preferred Shares have not already been converted, if and only if so elected by the Company, all Preferred Shares that remain outstanding shall automatically convert, with each Preferred Share then outstanding converting into the following number of Class A Ordinary Shares, based on the volume weighted average trading price of the Class A Ordinary Shares for 
30
 trading days immediately preceding the date of a written notice to the holders of the Preferred Shares of the Company’s election to automatically convert all then outstanding Preferred Shares (“
30
-Day VWAP Average”): 
•
if the 
30
-Day VWAP Average is equal to or greater than 
two
 times the Original Issue Price, one Class A Ordinary Share; or
•
if the 
30
-Day VWAP Average is less than 
two
 times the Original Issue Price but greater than 
25
% of the Original Issue Price, a number of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to (a) 
two
 times the Original Issue Price divided by (b) the 
30
-Day VWAP Average. 
If, based on the 
30
-Day VWAP Average, the value of a Preferred Share, on an as-converted basis, represents a return of the Original Issue Price ranging from a multiple of 
3.5
 to 
2.5
 of the Original Issue Price (“MOIP”) from the 
2
nd anniversary of the closing date to the 
5
th anniversary of the closing date, respectively, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, within 
five
 trading days thereafter, to notify the holders of the then outstanding Preferred Shares of the Company’s election to automatically convert without any further action by the holder thereof on the 
ten
th trading day following the achievement of the MOIP, each Preferred Share then outstanding into one Class A Ordinary Share. 
Liquidation
In the event of a Liquidation Event, the assets or proceeds available for distribution to the shareholders (the “Distributable Assets”) shall be distributed in the following order and preference:
First, the holders of Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be entitled to receive, from the Distributable Assets, prior and in preference to any distribution in respect of the Ordinary Shares, an amount for each Preferred Share held by them (the “Preference Amount”) equal to the greatest of 
•
(i) the sum of the Original Issue Price of such share plus an amount equal to 
3.0
% of the Original Issue Price for each full semi-annual period for which such Preferred Share has been outstanding (without compounding); 
•
(ii) the amount such holder would actually receive for each Preferred Share if such Preferred Share had been converted into Ordinary Shares immediately prior to such Liquidation Event; or 
•
(iii) 
two
 times the Original Issue Price. 
Second, after payment in full of the Preference Amount in respect of all Preferred Shares then outstanding, the remaining Distributable Assets, if any, shall be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the holders of Pagaya Ordinary Shares. 
In the event that the Distributable Assets are insufficient to pay in full the Preference Amount in respect of each Preferred Share then outstanding, then all of such Distributable Assets shall be distributed on a pari passu basis among the holders of the Preferred Shares in proportion to the respective full Preference Amount otherwise payable to such holders. 
Dividends
Preferred Shares, Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares shall be treated equally and ratably, on a per share basis with respect to any dividend or distribution paid or distributed by the Company. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not paid cash dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay cash dividends in the future.
F-36
Table of 
Contents
Voting
Each holder of Preferred Shares shall have 
one
 vote for each Ordinary Share into which the Preferred Shares held by such holder could be converted, as of the applicable record date set for the vote on any matter, whether the vote thereon is conducted by a show of hands, by written ballot or by any other means. 
Redemption
Preferred Shares are not redeemable at the election of the holder, except that in the event of a change in control resulting from the sale or transfer of the Company’s securities, which qualifies as a Liquidation Event.
The Company classifies its Preferred Shares as temporary equity because they may become redeemable due to certain change in control events that are outside the Company’s control, including a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets of the Company. The Company has not adjusted the carrying values of the Preferred Shares to its redemption value because redemption was not probable as of the balance sheet dates presented. The Company will adjust the carrying value of the Preferred Shares to its redemption value if redemption becomes probable in the future. 
Ordinary Share Offering
On March 13, 2024, the Company priced an offering of 
7,500,000
 of its Class A Ordinary Shares, no par value, pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Jefferies LLC as representatives of the several underwriters. The proceeds from the offer and sale of the securities are approximately $
90.0
 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and fees and offering expenses payable by the Company.

no
 grant of share options during the year ended December 31, 2023. The weighted-average grant date fair value of employee options granted for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $

approximately $
1.7
 million, $
10.9
 million and $
19.2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total fair value of share options vested for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $
57.2
 million, $
62.4
 million and $
36.0
 million, respectively.
Share-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value on a straight-line basis for graded awards with only service conditions, which is generally the option vesting term of 
four years
. The fair value of each option on the date of grant is determined using the Black Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model using the single-option award approach with the assumptions set forth in the table below. 
Fair Value of Ordinary Shares
—Prior to the Company’s public listing, the absence of an active market for the Company’s ordinary shares required the Company’s board of directors to determine the fair value of its ordinary shares for purposes of granting share options. The Company obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the board of directors in determining the fair value of the Company’s ordinary share. After the IPO, the fair value of each ordinary share was based on the closing price of the Company’s publicly traded ordinary shares as reported on the date of the grant.
Expected Volatility
—Expected volatility of share options was calculated based on the Company’s volatility as well as the implied volatilities from market comparisons of certain publicly traded companies and other factors.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
—The risk-free interest rate is determined using a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds for the period that coincides with the expected term set forth. 
Expected Term
— The expected term of share options represents the weighted average period the share options are expected to be outstanding. For option grants that are considered to be “plain vanilla”, the Company has opted to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term as provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. 
Expected Dividend Yield
—The dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical and future expectation of dividends payouts. Historically, the Company has not paid cash dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay cash dividends in the future. 
The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of share options granted for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

At December 31, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share options was approximately $
19.7
 million, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 
1.07
 years. 
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
—RSUs generally vest over 
two years
 of the employment commencement date with 
50
% vesting on the 
twelve-month
 anniversary of the employment commencement date, and the remaining on a pro-rata basis each quarter over the remaining 
twelve months
. RSUs granted are forfeited at termination of employment. Any RSUs, which are forfeited or not exercised before expiration, become available for future grants.

Options to Restricted Shares
In March 2021, the Company granted 
18.7
 million options to purchase restricted shares (the “First Awards”) at an exercise price of approximately $

The Qualifying Event, further, contains additional market-based vesting conditions driven by the total value of the Company. The First Awards do not get accelerated upon any events. Any Awards that do not vest on such date (if such date is triggered by a Qualifying Event) will remain eligible for vesting following a Qualifying Event. However, any Awards that do not vest on or before the earlier to occur of a Transaction and the expiration date (
10

60
) days). Any options or shares received in connection with the exercise of an option that have not satisfied the Valuation-Based Vesting Condition on or prior to the 
ten
th anniversary of the Grant Date (or such shorter period required by applicable law or for tax efficiency purposes) (the "Expiration Date") shall expire or be forfeited without consideration, as applicable, on the Expiration Date, and (ii) The

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
Deferred taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, a valuation allowance was provided reducing the deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from its net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.

NOTE 18 - 
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Net income (loss) per share is presented in conformity with the two-class method required for multiple classes of ordinary share and participating securities. 
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of share options, restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding share options, restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. 
The Company has 
two
 classes of ordinary share subsequent to the EJFA Merger on June 22, 2022: Class A and Class B. See Note 3 for additional information. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A Ordinary Shares assumes the conversion of Class B Ordinary Shares, while the diluted net income per share of Class B Ordinary Shares does not assume the conversion of those shares. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares are identical, except with respect to voting. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and result in an identical net loss per share for each class under the two-class method. 
The Preferred Shares are a participating security, whereby if a dividend is declared to the holders of ordinary shares, the holders of Preferred Shares would participate to the same extent as if they had converted the Preferred Shares to ordinary shares. Net loss is attributed to ordinary shareholders and participating securities based on their participation rights. Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders is not allocated to the Preferred Shares as the holders of the Preferred Shares do not have a contractual obligation to share in any losses. 
The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except share and per share data):
