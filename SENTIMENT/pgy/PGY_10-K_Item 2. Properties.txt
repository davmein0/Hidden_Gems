Item 2. Properties
Our main offices are in New York, NY (Headquarters) and Tel Aviv, Israel. We also lease offices in Austin, Texas, and San Mateo, CA. None of our facilities are owned by Pagaya. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and we believe we can acquire suitable additional or alternative space as needed.
