Market Information

Our common stock has been listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “ETNB” since November 11, 2019. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock.

Holders of Record

As of February 24, 2025, there were approximately five stockholders of record of our common stock. Since many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

Dividend Policy

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and have no present intention to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, earnings, projected capital and other cash requirements, legal requirements, restrictions in the agreements governing any indebtedness we may enter into, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K
.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. Our lead product candidate, pegozafermin, a specifically engineered glycoPEGylated analog of fibroblast growth factor 21 (“FGF21”), is currently being developed for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (“MASH”), previously known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (“SHTG”). Refer to the section titled “Business” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our clinical development programs in MASH and SHTG.

We commenced operations in 2018 and have devoted substantially all of our resources to raising capital, acquiring our initial product candidate, identifying and developing pegozafermin, licensing certain related technology, conducting research and development activities (including preclinical studies and clinical trials) and providing general and administrative support for these activities.

In April 2024, we entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with BiBo Biopharma Engineering Co., Ltd. (“BiBo”), pursuant to which BiBo will construct a production facility specifically designed to supply us with pegozafermin for commercialization, if approved (the “Production Facility”). Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, BiBo will build the Production Facility at BiBo’s facility in the Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to manufacture the bulk active ingredient (the “Drug Substance”) required to produce pegozafermin for commercial supply. The platform is expected to provide us with manufacturing capacity to meet our commercial needs.

We expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $440.0 million as of December 31, 2024, supplemented by $269.9 million in net proceeds from our February 2025 equity offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least one year following the filing of this Form 10-K
.

We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $367.1 million, $142.2 million and $102.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $824.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses as we advance pegozafermin and any future product candidates through clinical trials, seek regulatory approval for pegozafermin and any future product candidates, expand our clinical, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities, protect our intellectual property, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization of pegozafermin and any future product candidates, expand our general and administrative support functions, including hiring additional personnel, and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities.

Components of Results of Operations

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our lead product candidate, pegozafermin. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs related to preclinical and clinical development, including costs related to acquiring patents and intellectual property, expenses incurred under license agreements and agreements with contract research organizations and consultants, costs incurred pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement with BiBo, costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, including under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors,

65

costs related to the preparation of regulatory submissions and expenses related to laboratory supplies and services, as well as personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for individuals involved in research and development efforts.

We expense all research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. We accrue for costs incurred as services are provided based on invoices and statements received from our external service providers and by monitoring the status of their activities. We adjust our accrued expenses as actual costs become known.

Payments associated with licensing agreements to acquire licenses to develop, use, manufacture and commercialize products that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have alternate commercial use are expensed as incurred. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements or license agreements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, which is generally upon achievement of the milestone.

We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of pegozafermin and continue to invest in research and development activities. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of pegozafermin and any future product candidates is highly uncertain. To the extent that pegozafermin continues to advance into larger and later stage clinical trials, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. The actual probability of success for pegozafermin or any future product candidate may be affected by a variety of factors, including the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, investment in our clinical programs, manufacturing capability and competition with other products. As a result, we are unable to determine the timing of initiation, duration and completion costs of our research and development efforts or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of pegozafermin or any future product candidate.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resource, audit and accounting services, consulting costs and allocated facilities costs. Personnel and related costs consist of salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and other administrative functions. Facilities costs consist of rent and maintenance of facilities. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business and support our continued research and development activities.

Interest Expense

Interest expense consists of cash interest related to our term loan facility, noncash interest attributable to the accretion of end of term loan fees, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our term loan facility and loss on extinguishment of debt.

Interest Income and Other, Net

Interest income and other, net is primarily comprised of interest income derived from marketable securities, including the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums.

Income Taxes

We make estimates of the amounts to recognize for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, provisions are established for uncertain tax positions taken.

Research and development expenses increased by $222.8 million to $345.0 million in 2024, compared to $122.2 million in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a $156.4 million increase in contract manufacturing costs, which included $121.5 million 
(net of applicable value-added tax)
 in milestone payments made to BiBo pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement to secure manufacturing capacity to produce pegozafermin for our commercial needs. The remaining increase in contract manufacturing costs was primarily related to the supply of pegozafermin and clinical materials for our three Phase 3 clinical trials. Clinical development costs also increased by $55.4 million primarily due to the initiation and continuation of our Phase 3 clinical trials. Additionally, personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, increased by $9.4 million primarily due to increased headcount.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased by $10.6 million to $39.6 million in 2024, compared to $29.0 million in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a $5.4 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including a $2.3 million increase in stock-based compensation, reflecting higher headcount to support our growth. The increase was also driven by a $3.7 million increase in consulting and professional fees and a $1.5 million increase in facilities and other costs.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased by $0.5 million to $5.3 million in 
2024 
from $4.8 million in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances and interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023.

Interest Income and Other, Net

Interest income and other, net increased by $5.9 million to $23.6 million in 
2024 
from $17.7 million in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increased average investment balances and higher average yields earned on those balances in 2024, compared to 2023.

67

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense decreased by $3.2 million to $0.7 million in 2024 from $3.9 million in 2023. The 2023 income tax expense primarily related to a provision for uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

To date, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $440.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $824.5 million.

Sources of Liquidity

At-the-Market (“ATM”) Offerings

In March 2021, we entered into an ATM sales agreement (as amended, the “Sales Agreement”) with Leerink Partners LLC and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (the “Sales Agents”) pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $75.0 million of shares of our common stock (the “2021 ATM Facility”) from time to time pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Sales Agents are entitled to compensation at a commission of up to 3.0% of the aggregate gross sales price per share sold under the Sales Agreement. In February 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Sales Agreement, establishing a new ATM facility with an aggregate offering amount of up to $150.0 million of shares of our common stock (the “2023 ATM Facility”) pursuant to an effective registration statement.

In 2023, we sold 2,168,539 shares of our common stock under the 2021 ATM Facility and 2023 ATM Facility and received net proceeds of $37.1 million.

In 2024, we sold 1,396,888 shares of our common stock under the 2023 ATM Facility and received net proceeds of $21.0 million. There were no sales under the 2023 ATM facility for the three months ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there was $104.4 million remaining for future sales under the 2023 ATM Facility.

Underwritten Public Offerings

In March 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and raised net proceeds of $296.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $19.0 million and other offering costs of $0.5 million. In December 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of $161.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $10.4 million and other offering costs of $0.4 million.

In November 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of $136.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $7.2 million and other offering costs of $0.3 million.

In February 2025, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock and raised net proceeds of $269.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $17.3 million and other offering costs of $0.3 million.

Exercises of Common Stock Warrants

In 2023, warrants to purchase 2,927,570 shares of our common stock were exercised for cash generating proceeds of $15.6 million.

In 2024, pre-funded warrants to purchase 799,906 shares of our common stock were exercised via cashless exercises and warrants to purchase 10,179,789 shares of our common stock were exercised for cash generating proceeds of $54.2 million resulting in the issuance of a total of 10,979,695 shares of common stock.

68

Term Loan Facility

In January 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Original Loan Agreement”) with the lender parties thereto (the “Lenders”), K2 HealthVentures LLC as administrative agent and Ankura Trust Company, LLC as collateral agent. The Original Loan Agreement provided for a term loan facility with a maximum aggregate principal of $100.0 million, consisting of up to four separate delayed-draw term loans (“Initial Term Loan”). Upon execution of the agreement, we drew $25.0 million pursuant to the Original Loan Agreement. An additional $25.0 million expired undrawn and $50.0 million available at the Lenders’ discretion lapsed upon refinancing of the debt (discussed below).

In September 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Original Loan Agreement (the “Amendment” and the Original Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, the “Loan Agreement”) increasing the maximum aggregate principal amount in delayed-draw term loans to $150.0 million (the “Term Loan”) from $100.0 million. The Loan Agreement consists of (i) a first tranche of $70.0 million, of which $35.0 million was funded at closing (including the refinancing of the existing $25.0 million principal balance outstanding) and of which an additional $35.0 million is available through June 30, 2025, (ii) a second tranche of $30.0 million available to be funded upon the achievement of a specific clinical development milestone through December 31, 2025, and (iii) a third tranche of up to $50.0 million upon our request, subject to review by the Lenders of certain information from us and discretionary approval by the Lenders. We have not drawn any additional advances under the Loan Agreement since the September 2024 refinancing.

Funding Requirements

Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development and manufacturing expenditures related to our lead product candidate, pegozafermin. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical development of our current and future product candidates. At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical development, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs we will incur and the timelines that will be required to complete development, obtain marketing approval, and commercialize our current product candidate or any future product candidates. For the same reasons, we are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from product sales or our current or any future license agreements which we may enter into or whether, or when, if ever, we may achieve profitability. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast the timing and amounts of milestone, royalty and other revenue from licensing activities, which future product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.

Based on our current operating plan, we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $440.0 million as of December 31, 2024, supplemented by $269.9 million in net proceeds from our February 2025 equity offering, will be sufficient to fund our operations for a period of at least one year following the filing of this Form 10-K. However, our operating plans and other demands on our cash resources may change as a result of many factors, and we may seek additional funds sooner than planned. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:

•
the progress, timing, scope, results and costs of our clinical trials of pegozafermin and preclinical studies or clinical trials of other potential product candidates we may choose to pursue in the future, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner for our clinical trials;

•
the costs and timing of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies and validating the commercial manufacturing process for pegozafermin and any other product candidates we may identify and develop;

•
the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals;

•
the timing and amount of any milestone, royalty or other payments we are required to make pursuant to current or any future collaboration or license agreements;

•
costs of acquiring or in-licensing other product candidates and technologies;

69

•
the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;

•
the costs associated with attracting, hiring and retaining additional qualified personnel as our business grows;

•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;

•
the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and

•
the cost overruns under the Collaboration Agreement if the actual costs of the Production Facility are greater than the estimated budget.

We expect to continue to generate substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development activities. We will continue to fund our operations primarily through utilization of our current financial resources and through additional raises of capital to advance our current product candidate through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. However, there is no assurance that such funding will be available to us or that it will be obtained on terms favorable to us or will provide us with sufficient funds to meet our objectives. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies.

To the extent that we raise additional capital through partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our then-existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our clinical trials or preclinical studies, research and development programs or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves.

Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of $367.8 million reflects a net loss of $367.1 million and a net change of $14.5 million in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by aggregate noncash charges of $13.8 million. The net loss was driven by milestone payments of $121.5 million (net of applicable value-added tax) made to our contract manufacturing partner, BiBo, under the Collaboration Agreement to secure manufacturing capacity to produce pegozafermin for our commercial needs. Noncash charges primarily included stock-based compensation expense of $20.6 million, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million related to the refinancing of our term loan, noncash operating lease expense of $0.7 million and amortization of debt discount and accretion of deferred debt costs of $0.8 million, offset in part by net accretion of discounts on marketable securities of $10.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $14.5 million and was primarily due to an increase in prepaid and other assets of $21.7 million as we made prepayments related to the initiation and continuation of our Phase 3 clinical trials, and a decrease in lease liabilities of $0.5 million,

70

partially offset by a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.0 million driven by timing of payments made and an increase in services rendered by contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations in connection with the Phase 3 clinical trials.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities of $129.2 million reflects a net loss of $142.2 million, partially offset by aggregate non-cash charges of $12.3 million and a net change of $0.7 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.0 million due to the timing of payments to vendors and a $3.7 million increase in other non-current liabilities related to tax accruals, offset in part by an increase in prepaid and other assets of $6.9 million related to our clinical trials, contract manufacturing and scale-up activities. Non-cash charges primarily included stock-based compensation expense of $16.1 million, a loss on debt extinguishment of $1.2 million related to our prior term loan, amortization of debt discount and accretion of the end of term fee related to our term loan facility of $0.9 million, offset in part by net accretion of discounts on marketable securities of $6.2 million.

Investing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $40.9 million, which consisted of $376.1 million in purchases of marketable securities, offset in part by $335.2 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $123.0 million, which consisted of $341.1 million in purchases of marketable securities, offset in part by $218.1 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities.

Financing Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $218.6 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds of $136.3 million from the sale of common stock in public offerings, proceeds of $54.2 million from the exercise of common stock warrants, net proceeds of $21.0 million pursuant to the sale of our common stock under our 2023 ATM Facility, net proceeds of $9.3 million from borrowings under the Loan Agreement and proceeds of $0.6 million from employee stock plans. Partially offsetting these inflows were $2.9 million in cash outflows. This amount primarily reflects payments for employee withholding taxes associated with the net share settlement of restricted stock units. Additionally, a portion of these payments related to payments of deferred offering costs.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $513.1 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds of $458.8 million from the sale of common stock in public offerings, net proceeds of $37.1 million pursuant to the sale of our common stock under our 2021 ATM Facility and 2023 ATM Facility, net proceeds of $24.4 million from borrowings under a term loan, proceeds of $15.6 million from the exercise of warrants and proceeds of $0.9 million from employee stock plans. This was offset in part by the repayment in full of $21.4 million on a prior term loan, including end of term and prepayment fees, and payments for taxes of $2.3 million related to net share settlement upon vesting of restricted stock units.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

Our cash requirements greater than one year related to contractual obligations and commitments include the following:

Debt Obligations

As of December 31, 2024, the principal amount under our Loan Agreement was $35.0 million, which is scheduled to mature on October 1, 2028. The loan 
provides for interest-only payments until January 1, 2027, which can be extended to January 1, 2028 upon achievement of a clinical milestone
. 
For additional information regarding the terms of the debt and interest payable, see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Asset Transfer and License Agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

In April 2018, we concurrently entered into two Asset Transfer and License Agreements with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (“Teva”) under which we acquired certain patents and intellectual property relating to two programs: (1) Teva’s glycoPEGylated FGF21 program, including the compound TEV-47948 (pegozafermin), a glycoPEGylated long-acting FGF21 (the “FGF21 Agreement”) and (2) Teva’s development program of small molecule inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (the “FASN Agreement” and together with the FGF21 Agreement, the “Teva Agreements”). In the fourth quarter of 2024, we returned to Teva all rights associated with the program under the FASN Agreement. We did not develop any product candidates under the FASN Agreement. Pursuant to the Teva Agreements, we paid Teva an initial nonrefundable upfront payment of $6.0 million. Under the FGF21 Agreement, we are required to pay Teva $2.5 million upon the achievement of a specified clinical development milestone (payable once, upon the first time such milestone is achieved) and additional payments totaling up to $65.0 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Teva tiered royalties at percentages in the low-to-mid single-digits on worldwide net sales on all products containing pegozafermin. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made a $2.5 million milestone payment to Teva following the achievement of a clinical development milestone under the FGF21 program in SHTG. As of December 31, 2024, the timing and likelihood of achieving any remaining milestones under the FGF21 Agreement are uncertain.

The FGF21 Agreement can be terminated (i) by us without cause upon 120 days’ written notice to Teva, (ii) by either party, if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations under the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 60 days after receiving notice thereof, or (iii) by either party, if a bankruptcy petition is filed against the other party and is not dismissed within 60 days. In addition, Teva can also terminate the agreement related to their glycoPEGylated FGF21 program in the event we, or any of our affiliates or sublicensees, challenges any of the Teva patents licensed to us, and the challenge is not withdrawn within 30 days of written notice from Teva.

Production Facility Funding Commitments

In April 2024, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which BiBo will construct the Production Facility. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are required to pay BiBo an aggregate of $135.0 million (exclusive of applicable value-added tax) toward the construction of the Production Facility (collectively, the “Payment”), of which $121.5 million (net of applicable value-added tax) in milestone payments were paid during the year ended December 31, 2024. The remaining $13.5 million will become payable upon achievement of certain specified milestones. If the actual costs of the Production Facility are substantially greater than the estimated budget, the parties will negotiate a means of allocating such cost overruns.

Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments

As of December 31, 2024, our lease for our corporate headquarters represents substantially all of operating lease obligations and 
undiscounted future minimum lease payments of $2.1 million remain on our leases as of that date.

In addition, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other vendors for research and development services. Such agreements generally provide for termination upon written notice but obligate us to reimburse vendors for any time or costs incurred through the date of termination.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are

72

critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimate
s.

While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.

Accrued Research and Development Expenses

We record accrued expenses for estimated preclinical and clinical trial and research expenses related to the services performed but not yet invoiced or for which we have not received vendor statements pursuant to contracts with research institutions, contract research organizations and clinical manufacturing organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies, and clinical trials, and research services on our behalf. Payments for these services are based on the terms of individual agreements and payment timing may differ significantly from the period in which the services were performed. Our estimates are based on factors such as the progress of work completed, including patient enrollment levels. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent reasonably possible and make judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. Our estimates of accrued expenses are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time. If we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued expenses. To date, we have not experienced significant changes in our estimates of preclinical studies and clinical trial accruals.

Stock-Based Compensation

We utilize stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) for equity compensation. W
e measure compensation related to equity awards granted to employees, directors, and non-employee service providers based on estimated fair values and recognize stock-based compensation over the requisite service period. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.

We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant, and the resulting stock-based compensation, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize compensation for stock option awards, including awards with graded-vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards that requires the use of subjective assumptions to determine the fair value of equity awards. These assumptions include:

•
Expected volatility—We have a limited trading history for our common stock. As a result, we estimate the expected volatility based on a combination of our own historical stock price volatility and that of a publicly traded set of peer companies such that the time period over which historical volatility data used is at least equal to the expected term of the option award. The peer companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle, or area of specialty. We apply judgment in selecting a peer group as each of the peers are engaged in varied research and development activities, the timing and progress of which differ within the peer group.

•
Expected term—The expected term of options granted to employees and directors is determined using the “simplified” method. Under this approach, the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the weighted-average vesting term and the contractual term of the option. The simplified method makes the assumption that the employee will exercise stock options evenly over the period when the stock options are vested and ending on the date when the stock options would expire. The expected option term for options granted to non-employees is estimated on a grant-by-grant basis.

•
Risk-free interest rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds in effect on the grant date for periods with an equivalent expected term as the option.

•
Expected dividend—We have never paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to pay dividends on our shares of common stock. Therefore, we use an expected dividend of zero.

We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.

73

The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs are based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are service-based awards and are recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized over the estimated service period for each tranche of an award (the accelerated attribution method) when its performance condition is deemed probable of achievement. For PSUs containing performance conditions which were not deemed probable of achievement, no stock compensation expense is recognized. Additionally, at each reporting period, we evaluate the probable outcome of the performance conditions and as applicable, recognize the cumulative effect of the change in estimate in the period of the change.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in past fiscal years, and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations.

We have established a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. We intend to maintain the valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is based on the detailed facts and circumstances of each issue. For example, in December 2023, we received a primary assessment from the Israeli Tax Authorities (“ITA”) related to our 2019 reorganization and intercompany transaction to license the intellectual property rights from our Israeli subsidiary to our U.S. entity. The ITA has alleged that the transaction is deemed to be a sale of intellectual property rights. We are appealing the tax assessment and intend to continue to challenge the ITA’s position. We believe our accruals for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 are adequate. However, it is possible that the final resolution of this matter could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See further discussion in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to income tax expense in the period of change.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one yet, of their potential impact on our financial condition of results of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $440.0 million. We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds and certificates of deposit, securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities and commercial paper. We place our investments with high-quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. A portion of our investments consisting of interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value due to a rise in interest rates. The portfolio includes cash equivalents and marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments and the short-term maturities of our investments, 
we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment.

As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate outstanding principal balance under our term loan facility was $35.0 million. The term loan has a variable interest rate calculated by reference to the Prime Rate and matures on October 1, 2028. We carry these instruments at face value, less unamortized discounts and issuance costs, on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Based on the outstanding balance at December 31, 2024, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our term loan, and would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value.

Foreign Exchange Risk

As a result of our operations in Israel, we have exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates from transactions that are denominated in the New Israeli Shekel (“NIS”). The functional currency of our subsidiary in Israel is the U.S. Dollar. Our exposure arises primarily from cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses denominated in NIS. We have not hedged our foreign currency since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results. Based on our foreign currency exchange rate exposures at December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% adverse fluctuation in the average exchange rate of the NIS would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our exposure to foreign exchange risk as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.

89bio, Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 89bio, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance

77

with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

Notes to C
onsolidated Financial Statements

1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

Description of Business
89bio, Inc. (including its consolidated subsidiaries, also referred to as “89bio,” the “company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. Our lead product candidate, pegozafermin, a specifically engineered glycoPEGylated analog of fibroblast growth factor 21 (“FGF21”), is currently being developed for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (“MASH”), previously known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (“SHTG”).
89bio was formed as a Delaware corporation in 
June 2019
 to carry on the business of 89Bio Ltd., which was incorporated in Israel in January 2018.

Liquidity
We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit of 
$
824.5
 million
 as of December 31, 2024. We have historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, including warrants, and from borrowings under term loan facilities. To date, none of our product candidates have been approved for sale, and we have not generated any revenue from commercial products. We expect operating losses to continue and increase for the foreseeable future as we progress our clinical development activities for our product candidates.
We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 
$
440.0
 million
 as of December 31, 2024, 
supplemented by $
269.9
 million in net proceeds from our February 2025 equity offering, will be sufficient to fund our 
planned operating expense and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least one year from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policie
s
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 89bio and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to accruals for uncertain tax positions, accrued research and development expenses and the valuation of stock options. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts those estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currencies
We engage in foreign-currency-denominated transactions with certain vendors, as well as between subsidiaries with different functional currencies. Our
 subsidiary 
in Israel uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency for financial reporting. Gains and losses from foreign-currency-denominated transactions, primarily denominated in

83

New 
Israeli Shekels, were not material for all periods presented and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a component of interest income and other, net. Our subsidiary in Lithuania uses the Euro as its functional currency for financial reporting. The re-measurement from Euros to U.S. dollars results in translation gain and loss adjustments, which are included in the consolidated balance sheets as part of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels are directly related to the amount of subjectivity with the inputs to the valuation of these assets or liabilities as follows:
Level 1
—Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;

Level 2
—Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable inputs for similar assets or liabilities. These include quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and

Level 3
—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities and common stock warrants issued in connection with a term loan facility that do not meet all of the criteria for equity classification.
Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

Our financial instruments, including cash, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at cost which approximates their fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The fair value of our term loan approximates its carrying value, or amortized cost, due to the prevailing market rates of interest it bears.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Bank deposits are held by accredited financial institutions and these deposits may at times be in excess of insured limits. We limit our credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by placing them with financial institutions that we believe are of high quality. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash or cash equivalents. We have
 established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity and 
limit amounts invested in marketable securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. As of December 31, 2024, we do not believe a significant risk of loss from a concentration of credit risk exists with respect to our marketable securities.
Other Risks and Uncertainties

Our future results of operations involve a number of other risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include, but are not limited to, our early stages of clinical drug development; our ability to advance product candidates into, and successfully complete, clinical trials on the timelines we project; our ability to adequately demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy of our product candidates; our ability to enroll patients in our ongoing and future clinical trials; our ability to successfully manufacture and supply our product candidates for clinical trials; our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our operations; uncertainties related to the projections of the size of patient populations suffering from the diseases we are targeting; our ability to obtain, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights;

84

developments relating to our competitors and our industry, including competing product candidates and therapies; general economic and market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties.
Our product candidates will require approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and comparable foreign regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales in their respective jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that any product candidates will receive the necessary approvals. If we are denied approval, approval is delayed or we are unable to maintain approval for any product candidate, it could have a materially adverse impact on us.
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that have the following characteristics: (i) they engage in business activities from which they may earn revenue and incur expense, (ii) their operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for resource allocation decisions and performance assessment, and (iii) their discrete financial information is available. Our CODM is our 
Chief Executive Officer,
 who manages and allocates resources to our operations on a consolidated basis. We operate as 
one
 segment and our operations are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. Segment information is further described in Note 11.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less from the purchase date to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of amounts invested in money market funds, commercial paper and U.S. government treasury securities and are carried at fair value.
Marketable Securities
We invest our excess cash in marketable securities with high credit ratings including money market funds, commercial paper, securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and corporate debt securities. We account for all marketable securities as available-for-sale, as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity. These marketable securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for accretion of premiums and amortization of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion, as well as interest and dividends, are included in interest income and other, net. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are also included in interest income and other, net. We classify our marketable securities as current assets, which reflects our intention to use the proceeds from sales of these securities to fund our operations, as necessary, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date.
We periodically assess our available-for-sale marketable securities for impairment. For marketable securities in an unrealized loss position, this assessment first takes into account our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the marketable security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through interest income and other, net. For marketable securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we assess whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recorded in interest income and other, net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive loss. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectability of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. These changes are recorded in interest income and other, net. To date, we have not experienced any credit-related losses on our marketable securities.

85

Leases

We have noncancellable operating leases for office space. We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially all the economic benefit from or to direct the use of such assets. When we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date at the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. The present value of lease payments is determined by using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, we use our estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate that we would pay for a similar amount and term. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective-interest method. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets. We do not have any material short-term leases.
When our real estate lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components (for example, common area maintenance and other operating costs), we have applied the practical expedient to combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component, which increases assets and corresponding liabilities. Any variable payments are expensed as incurred and are not included in the operating lease asset and liability. Lease expense for an operating lease liability is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any rent-free periods, and is included in operating expenses.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally ranging from 
three
 to 
seven years
. 
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the assets’ estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
 Upon retirement or sale of the assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and ROU assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or group of assets may not be fully recoverable. If indicators of impairment exist and the undiscounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate are less than the carrying value of the assets, we reduce the carrying amount of the assets through an impairment charge, to their estimated fair values based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. There were no impairment indicators for the periods presented.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
We record preclinical and clinical study and research expenses based on the services performed, pursuant to contracts with research institutions that conduct and manage preclinical and clinical studies and research services on its behalf. The majority of these expenses are recorded based on invoices and statements received from these vendors. We also record these expenses based upon the estimated services provided but not yet invoiced. Liabilities associated with these expenses are included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are recorded as research and development expenses.
In 
making these estimates of services provided but not yet invoiced or for which statements have not been received from vendors, we consider factors such as estimates of the progress of work completed in accordance with agreements established with our third-party service providers. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued expenses. We have not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred. However, the status and timing of actual services performed may vary from our estimates, resulting in adjustments to expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to our accrued expenses

86

could 
materially affect our results of operations. Contingent milestone payments, if any, are recognized when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, which is generally upon achievement of the milestone.
Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
Warrants to purchase common stock are classified as either a liability or equity. If the warrants are mandatorily redeemable, require settlement in cash or a variable number of shares, they are classified as a liability. If not classified as a liability under those criteria, we then assess whether the warrants may require cash settlement. Warrants that may require cash settlement are classified as liabilities, regardless of the likelihood of that settlement. Liability-classified warrants are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a gain or loss. If the warrants do not require liability classification under those criteria, and are indexed to our common stock, they are classified as equity. Equity-classified warrants are initially measured at fair value, with no subsequent changes in fair value recognized.
Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our lead product candidate, pegozafermin. Research and development expenses consist primarily of external costs related to preclinical and clinical development and related supplies and personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of salaries, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for individuals involved in research and development efforts. Payments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services by the third parties are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.

Payments associated with agreements to acquire licenses to develop, use, manufacture and commercialize products and purchases of pegozafermin from contract manufacturing organizations that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have alternate future commercial use are expensed as incurred.  Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under license or other agreements, the milestone payment obligations are recognized as expense when achievement of the contingent milestone is probable, which is generally upon achievement of the milestone.
Stock-Based Compensation
We utilize stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) for equity compensation. We measure equity awards made to employees, directors, and

non-employee service providers based on estimated fair values and recognize stock-based compensation over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a

Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recognize compensation for stock option awards, including awards with graded-vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are expected volatility, expected option term (the time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire), risk-free rate, and expected dividend rate. These assumptions include:
•
Expected volatility—We have a limited trading history for our common stock. As a result, we estimate expected volatility based on a combination of our own historical stock price volatility and that of a publicly traded set of peer companies such that the time period over which historical volatility data used is at least equal to the expected term of the option award. The peer companies were chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle, or area of specialty.
•
Expected term—The expected term of options granted to employees and directors is determined using the “simplified” method. Under this approach, the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the weighted-average vesting term and the contractual term of the option. The simplified method makes the assumption that the employee will exercise stock options evenly over the period when the stock options are vested and ending on the date when the stock options would expire. The expected option term for options granted to non-employees is estimated on a grant-by-grant basis.

87

•
Risk-free interest rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds in effect on the grant date for periods with an equivalent expected term as the option.
•
Expected dividend—We have never paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to pay dividends on our shares of common stock. Therefore, an expected dividend of zero is used.
The grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs are based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs are service-based awards and are recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized over the estimated service period for each tranche of an award (the accelerated attribution method) when its performance condition is deemed probable of achievement. For PSUs containing performance conditions which were not deemed probable of achievement, 
no
 stock compensation expense is recognized. Additionally, at each reporting period, we evaluate the probable outcome of the performance conditions and as applicable, recognize the cumulative effect of the change in estimate in the period of the change.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.

A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We have established full valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income is not more likely than not as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We intend to maintain the valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances.
The calculation of our accruals for tax contingencies involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue are based on the detailed facts and circumstances of each issue. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Based on new information becoming available, or other relevant developments occur, we adjust our accrued amounts accordingly. Any adjustment will impact income tax expense or benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and the adjustment could be material. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within income tax expense.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share
Basic and diluted net loss per share is calculated based upon the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
. 
Shares of common stock that are potentially issuable for little or no cash consideration at issuance are included in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share
, 
even if they are antidilutive.

During periods of income, participating securities are allocated a proportional share of income determined by dividing total weighted-average participating securities by the sum of the total weighted-average common shares and participating securities (the “two-class method”). Shares of our common stock warrants participate in any dividends that may be declared by us and are therefore considered to be participating securities. Participating securities have the effect of diluting both basic and diluted earnings per share during periods of income. During

88

periods of loss, no loss is allocated to participating securities since they have no contractual obligation to share in our losses. Diluted loss per share is computed after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of stock options, RSUs, PSUs and common stock warrants, except where such non-participating securities would be anti-dilutive. 
As we incurred net losses for the periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and changes in unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM, a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires all annual disclosures required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods. The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. We adopted this ASU for the annual period ended December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. While the adoption had no impact on our financial statements, additional required disclosures have been included in Note 11.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-09”), which requires companies to disclose, on an annual basis, specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU 2023-09 requires companies to disclose additional information about income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for our annual periods beginning on January 1, 2025 and will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. There will be no impact to our consolidated financial statements; however, there will be changes to our consolidated financial statement disclosures, primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and cash paid for income taxes.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, that will require entities to provide enhanced disclosures related to certain expense categories included in income statement captions. The ASU aims to increase transparency and provide investors with more detailed information about the nature of expenses reported on the face of the income statement. The standard does not change the requirements for the presentation of expenses on the face of the income statement. The ASU is effective for our annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2027 and interim reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2028. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statement disclosures.

The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices when available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value for the security is estimated under the market or income approach using pricing models with market observable inputs.

Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Warrant Liability
As of December 31, 2024
, our only financial liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis relates to warrants to purchase up to 
311,996
 shares of our common stock issued in connection with the Term Loan (See Note 6). The number of warrants that become exercisable is contingent on subsequent loan advances drawn by us under the Term Loan facility. As such, the warrants are not considered to be indexed to our own stock and were accounted for as a liability. We recorded the fair value of the warrants upon issuance using a probability-weighted scenario analysis with a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We are required to revalue the warrants at each reporting date with any changes in fair value recorded on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss until the exercise contingencies are resolved. The valuation of the warrants is considered under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, taking into account the likelihood of the warrants becoming exercisable in addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The reconciliation of our warrant liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) is as follows:

5. Commitments and Contingencies

Leases
As of December 31, 2024, our lease for our corporate headquarters represents substantially all of operating lease obligations. In November 2023, we entered into a lease (“HQ Lease”) with respect to approximately 
17,616
 square feet of office space in San Francisco, California for a lease term commencing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and ending in March 2027. The HQ Lease does not provide for any extension or renewal options. The HQ Lease includes an abatement period during which we were not required to remit monthly rent payments until April 2024 and has escalating rent payments during the lease term. Additionally, the scheduled lease payments also include our proportionate share of certain 
operating expenses. All scheduled lease payments have been included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in accordance with our accounting policy election to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component.
Our lease for approximately 
3,600
 square feet of additional office space in San Francisco under a non-cancelable operating lease expired in 
January 2025
.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, lease expense was $
1.0
 million, $
0.3
 million and $
0.2
 million, respectively. Variable lease payments for the same periods were not material. As of 
December 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 
2.2
 years and the weighted-average incremental borrowing rate used to determine operating lease liabilities was 
13.4
%
.

Asset Transfer and License Agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd

In April 2018, we concurrently entered into two Asset Transfer and License Agreements with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (“Teva”) under which we acquired certain patents and intellectual property relating to two programs: (1) Teva’s glycoPEGylated FGF21 program, including the compound TEV-47948 (pegozafermin), a glycoPEGylated long-acting FGF21 (the “FGF21 Agreement”) and (2) Teva’s development program of small molecule inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (the “FASN Agreement” and together with the FGF21 Agreement, the “Teva Agreements”). In the fourth quarter of 2024, we returned to Teva all rights associated with the program under the FASN Agreement. We did not develop any product candidates under the FASN Agreement. Pursuant to the Teva Agreements, we paid Teva an initial nonrefundable upfront payment of $
6.0
 million. Under the FGF21 Agreement, we are required to pay Teva $
2.5
 million upon the achievement of a specified clinical development milestone (payable once, upon the first time such milestone is achieved) and additional payments totaling up to $
65.0
 million upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay Teva tiered royalties at percentages in the low-to-mid single-digits on worldwide net sales on all products containing pegozafermin.
The FGF21 Agreement can be terminated (i) by us without cause upon 
120 days
’ written notice to Teva, (ii) by either party, if the other party materially breaches any of its obligations under the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 
60 days
 after receiving notice thereof, or (iii) by either party, if a bankruptcy petition is filed against the other party and is not dismissed within 
60 days
. In addition, Teva can also terminate the agreement related to the glycoPEGylated FGF21 program in the event we, or any of our affiliates or sublicensees, challenges any of the Teva patents licensed to us, and the challenge is not withdrawn within 30 days of written notice from Teva.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, we made a $
2.5
 million milestone 
payment to Teva following the achievement of a clinical development milestone under the FGF21 program in SHTG. As of December 31, 2024, the timing and

92

likelihood 
of achieving any remaining milestones under the FGF21 program are uncertain. Milestone payment obligations will be recognized when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, which is generally upon achievement of the applicable milestone.
Bibo Collaboration Agreement
On 
April 4, 2024
, we entered into a collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with BiBo Biopharma Engineering Co., Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“BiBo”), pursuant to which BiBo will construct a production facility specifically designed to supply us with pegozafermin for commercialization, if approved (the “Production Facility”).
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, BiBo will build the Production Facility at BiBo’s facility in the Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to manufacture the bulk active ingredient (the “Drug Substance”) required to produce pegozafermin for commercial supply. The platform is expected to provide us with manufacturing capacity to meet our commercial needs. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are required to pay BiBo an aggregate of $
135.0
 million (exclusive of applicable value-added tax) toward the construction of the Production Facility (collectively, the “Payment”), of which $
121.5
 million (net of applicable value-added tax) in milestone payments were paid during the year ended December 31, 2024 and recorded in “Research and Development” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The remaining $
13.5
 million will become payable upon achievement of certain specified milestones. If the actual costs of the Production Facility are substantially greater than the estimated budget, the parties will negotiate a means of allocating such cost overruns.

6. Term Loan Facility
Original Loan Agreement
In January 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Original Loan Agreement”) with the lender parties thereto (the “Lenders”), K2 HealthVentures LLC as administrative agent and Ankura Trust Company, LLC as collateral agent. The Original Loan Agreement provided for a term loan facility with a maximum aggregate principal of $
100.0
 million, consisting of up to four separate delayed-draw term loans (“Initial Term Loan”). Upon execution of the agreement, we drew $
25.0
 million pursuant to the Original Loan Agreement. An additional $
25.0
 million expired undrawn and $
50.0
 million available at the Lenders’ discretion lapsed upon refinancing of the debt (discussed below). Additionally, the Lenders may elect to convert up to an aggregate of $
7.5
 million of the principal amount of the Initial Term Loan then outstanding into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $
12.6943
 per share. Notwithstanding the Loan Agreement (as defined below), this conversion right remains outstanding. The Initial Term Loan bore interest equal to the greater of (i) 
8.45
% and (ii) the sum of (a) the Prime Rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus (b) 2
.25
% and provided for interest-only payments through February 1, 2025. Upon prepayment or maturity, we were required to pay an end of term fee equal to 
5.95
% of the aggregate principal amount of term loans advanced. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Lenders agreed to defer the payment of the existing end of term fee of $
1.5
 million to its originally scheduled maturity date of 
January 1, 2027
.
In connection with the advance of the Initial Term Loan, we issued warrants to purchase 
51,204
 shares of our common stock, which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The warrants were exercisable from the date of issuance and have a term of 
ten year
s with an exercise price of $
9.76
 per share. We also issued to the Lenders warrants to purchase 
153,611
 shares of common stock that were contingently exercisable upon funding of delayed-draw term loans. These contingently exercisable warrants were either forfeited upon expiration of the respective delayed-draw period or canceled in connection with the Loan Agreement.

Amended Loan Agreement
In September 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Original Loan Agreement (the “Amendment” and the Original Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, the “Loan Agreement”) increasing the maximum aggregate principal amount in delayed-draw term loans to $
150.0
 million (the “Term Loan”) from $
100.0
 million. The Loan Agreement consists of (i) a first tranche of $
70.0
 million, of which $
35.0
 million was funded at closing (including the refinancing of the existing $
25.0
 million principal balance outstanding) and of which an additional $
35.0
 million is available through June 30, 2025, (ii) a second tranche of $
30.0
 million 
available to be funded upon the achievement of a specific clinical development milestone through December 31, 2025, and (iii) a third tranche of

93

up 
to $
50.0
 million upon our request, subject to review by the Lenders of certain information from us and discretionary approval by the Lenders.
Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property. The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, restricts certain activities and includes customary events of default, including payment default, breach of covenants, change of control, and material adverse effects. In addition, commencing January 1, 2026, we are required to maintain minimum unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities equal to 
5.0
 times the average change in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities measured over the trailing three-month period. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Loan Agreement.

Borrowings under the Loan Agreement mature on 
October 1, 2028
 and provide for interest-only payments until January 1, 2027, which can be extended to January 1, 2028 upon achievement of a clinical milestone.
 Consecutive equal payments of principal and interest are due once the interest-only period has lapsed. The Term Loan bears interest equal to the greater of (i) 
8.95
% and (ii) the sum of (a) the Prime Rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus (b) 
1.75
%. On the date the debt was refinanced and on December 31, 2024, the stated interest rate on the outstanding Term Loan was 
9.75
% and 
9.25
%, respectively. An end of term fee of 
5.95
% of the aggregate principal amount of term loans advanced is also payable. We have the option to prepay the entire outstanding balance of borrowings under the Loan Agreement, subject to a prepayment fee ranging from 
1.0
% to 
3.0
% depending on the timing of such prepayment.
In connection with the Amendment, we issued warrants to purchase up to 
406,951
 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $
7.3719
 per share that expire 
10 years
 from the date of issuance. Of the 
406,951
 shares underlying the warrants issued, 
94,955
 shares were immediately exercisable upon the advance of $
35.0
 million at closing (including the refinancing of the existing $
25.0
 million principal balance outstanding) and met the criteria for equity classification. The remaining 
311,996
 shares become exercisable proportionally to future advances of delayed draw term loans and were liability classified and subject to remeasurement at each reporting period (see Note 3). In addition to the conversion right carried over from the Initial Term Loan, the Lenders may elect to convert up to an additional aggregate of $
5.0
 million of the principal amount of the Term Loan then outstanding into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $
9.5835
 per share.

We evaluated the debt refinancing to determine if it was an extinguishment or a modification of the debt. Due to the addition of a substantive conversion feature (it is reasonably possible that the conversion feature may be exercised and affect the manner of the debt instrument’s settlement), we determined that the refinancing was an extinguishment of debt. We measured the loss on extinguishment of debt based on the difference between the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt and the reacquisition price of the new debt, which included $
0.7
 million for amendment fees paid to the lender. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $
1.5
 million as a component of “Interest Expense” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024.

We assessed the embedded conversion feature and concluded that bifurcation and separate accounting as a derivative liability were not required because the feature is indexed to our own stock and meets the criteria for equity classification. The immediately exercisable warrants to purchase 
94,955
 shares of our common stock issued to the Lenders had a fair value of $
0.6
 million and was recorded as debt discount with a corresponding amount to additional paid-in capital. The contingently exercisable warrants to purchase 
311,996
 shares of our common stock had a fair value of $
0.5
 million at issuance and was recorded as deferred debt issuance costs within other current assets with a corresponding entry to warrant liability (see Note 3). The deferred debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over the respective delayed-draw term loan commitment periods under the Loan Agreement.

At-the-Market (“ATM”) Offerings
In March 2021, we entered into an ATM sales agreement (as amended, the “Sales Agreement”) with Leerink Partners LLC and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (the “Sales Agents”) pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $
75.0
 million of shares of our common stock (the “2021 ATM Facility”) from time to time pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Sales Agents are entitled to compensation at a commission of up to 
3.0
% of the aggregate gross sales price per share sold under the Sales Agreement. In February 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Sales Agreement, establishing a new ATM facility with an aggregate offering amount of up to $
150.0
 million of shares of our common stock (the “2023 ATM Facility”) pursuant to an effective registration statement.

In 2022, we sold 
3,948,611
 shares of our common stock under the 2021 ATM Facility and received net proceeds of $
28.5
 million.

In 2023, we sold 
2,168,539
 shares of our common stock under the 2021 ATM Facility and 2023 ATM Facility and received net proceeds of $
37.1
 million.
In 2024, we sold 
1,396,888
 shares of our common stock under the 2023 ATM Facility and received net proceeds of $
21.0
 million. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
104.4
 million remaining for future sales under the 2023 ATM Facility.

Underwritten Public Offerings

In July 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. We sold 
18,675,466
 shares of its common stock with accompanying warrants to purchase up to 
9,337,733
 shares 
of our common stock at a 

95

combined 
public offering price of $
3.55
 per share. We also sold 
7,944,252
 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock with accompanying warrants to purchase up to 
3,972,126
 shares of our common stock at a combined public offering price of $
3.549
 per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share public offering price for the common stock less $
0.001
 per share, the exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. We raised net proceeds of $
88.2
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
5.7
 million and other offering costs of $
0.6
 million.

The exercise of the outstanding pre-funded warrants is subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 
9.99
%, or at the election of the holder prior to the issuance of the pre-funded warrant, 
4.99
%, which a holder may increase or decrease from time to time but shall not exceed 
19.99
%. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of pre-funded warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock split, recapitalization, or reorganization or similar transaction, as described in the agreements. Under certain circumstances, the pre-funded warrants may be exercisable on a “cashless” basis. The common warrants and pre-funded warrants are classified as a component of stockholders’ equity and additional paid-in capital because such common warrants and pre-funded warrants (i) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the equity instruments, (ii) are immediately exercisable, (iii) do not embody an obligation for us to repurchase the shares, (iv) permit the holders to receive a fixed number of common shares upon exercise, (v) are indexed to our common stock and (vi) meet the equity classification criteria. In addition, the common warrants and pre-funded warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return.
In March 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock. We sold 
19,461,538
 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $
16.25
 per share. We raised aggregate proceeds of $
296.8
 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $
19.0
 million and other offering costs of $
0.5
 million.
In December 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. We sold 
17,567,567
 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $
9.25
 per share. We also sold 
1,081,081
 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at $
9.249
 per share, which represents the per share public offering price for the common stock less $
0.001
 per share, the exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. We raised net proceeds of $
161.8
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
10.4
 million and other offering costs of $
0.4
 million. The terms and conditions of the pre-funded warrants and rights and obligations of the holder are the same as the pre-funded warrants sold in the July 2022 public offering and are described above.
In November 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. We sold 
13,661,764
 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $
8.50
 per share. We also sold 
3,250,000
 pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at $
8.499
 per share, which represents the per share public offering price for the common stock less $
0.001
 per share, the exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. We raised net proceeds of $
136.3
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
7.2

. Stock-Based Compensation
Summary of Equity Incentive Plans
2019 Plan
In September 2019, our board of directors adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), which also became effective in September 2019. We initially reserved 
2,844,193
 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2019 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will automatically increase on the first day of January for a period of up to 
ten years
 in an amount equal to 
4
% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors.
Under the 2019 Plan, we may grant incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs and other stock-based awards including PSUs. Terms of stock option agreements, including vesting requirements, are determined by our 
board of directors, subject to the provisions of the 2019 Plan. Stock option awards generally vest over a 
four-year
 period, with 
25
% of options vesting on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and 
75
% vesting ratably, on a quarterly basis, over the remaining 
three years
. Such awards have a contractual term of 
ten years 
from the grant date. The exercise price of awards granted will not be less than the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. RSUs generally vest over a 
two
 or 
three-year
 period.
Inducement Plan
In February 2023, our board of directors adopted the 2023 Inducement Plan (the “Inducement Plan”) and reserved 
1,500,000
 shares of common stock for issuance. The Inducement Plan is a non-stockholder approved stock plan adopted pursuant to the “inducement exception” provided under Nasdaq listing rules. Under the Inducement Plan, we may grant non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to new hires who satisfy the requirements to be granted inducement grants under Nasdaq rules as an inducement material to the individual’s entry into employment with us. The terms of the Inducement Plan are substantially similar to the terms of the 2019 Plan. In September 2024, the Inducement Plan was amended and restated to increase the total number of shares authorized for issuance from 
1,500,000
 shares to 
2,500,000
 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In October 2019, our board of directors adopted the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which became effective in November 2019. We initially reserved 
225,188
 shares of common stock for purchase under the ESPP. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of January for a period of up to 
ten years
 in an amount equal to 
1
% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors. We typically make two offerings each year to eligible employees to purchase stock under the ESPP with each offering having a duration of approximately six months. For each offering period, ESPP participants may purchase shares of common stock at a price per share equal to 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on (1) the first trading day of the applicable offering period or (2) the last trading day of the applicable offering period.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had valuation allowances of 
$
214.6
 million
 and $
108.2
 million, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. These valuation allowances relate to tax loss and credit carryforwards and other temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the time and amount of which are uncertain. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe based upon the weight of available evidence that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through an adjustment to income tax expense. The valuation allowance increased by 
$
106.4
 million
 in 2024 from 2023, which primarily relates to significant taxable losses.
Available Carryforward Tax Losses and Credits
As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated tax loss carryforward of approximately 
$
255.5
 million
, 
$
496.5
 million
, and 
$
35.3
 million
 for federal, state and Israeli tax purposes, respectively. As of December 31, 2023
, we had an accumulated tax loss carryforward of approximately $
195.0
 million, $
302.8
 million, and $
30.4
 million for federal, state and Israeli tax purposes, respectively. Federal net operating losses generated after 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely but utilization will be limited to 80% of taxable income in the period that net operating losses are being utilized. Carryforward tax losses in California will begin to expire in 
2039
. Carryforward tax losses in Israel have no expiration date.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately 
$
19.7
 million
 and $
7.5
 million, respectively, which expire beginning in 
2040
. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately 
$
4.0
 million
 and $
3.2
 million, respectively, which will carry forward indefinitely.

Our unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, totaled $
16.8
 million at December 31, 2024, of which $
3.6
 million, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense. A material portion of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would increase our net operating loss carryforward and would not have an impact to the effective tax rate as it would be offset by a full valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to prior year tax positions increased by $
1.7
 million primarily due to unresolved issues associated with tax returns for tax years 
2018 through 2021
 being audited by the Israel Tax Authority (“ITA”). Additionally, gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $
3.0
 million 
related to current year tax positions, primarily due to reserves established for the federal research and development tax credit. In December 2023, we received a primary assessment from the ITA related to our 2019 reorganization and intercompany transaction to license the intellectual property rights from our Israeli subsidiary. The ITA has alleged that the transaction is deemed to be a sale of intellectual property rights. Although we believe we have adequately accounted

101

for 
our uncertain tax positions, the ultimate resolution of the ITA audit may result in payments that are materially different from what was originally recognized in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2024, discussions with the ITA are ongoing and no new information has been received that would alter our conclusions regarding the recognition and measurement of our tax positions related to this matter. We do not expect a resolution to be finalized within the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. However, it is possible that such increases or decreases may occur.
We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024, the interest related to uncertain tax positions was approximately $
0.6
 million.
We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, as well as income taxes in the states of California, Colorado, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and in various foreign jurisdictions. To date, we have not been subject to any federal or state income tax audits. As of December 31, 2024, all tax years remain open to examination.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a change in the treatment of research and development (“R&D”) expenditures for tax purposes under Section 174. Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, specified R&D expenditures must undergo a five-year amortization period for domestic spend and a 15-year amortization period for foreign spend. Prior to the effective date (2021 tax year and prior), taxpayers were able to immediately expense R&D costs under Section 174(a) or had the option to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures over a five-year recovery period under Section 174(b). We have evaluated the current legislation at this time and prepared the provision by following the treatment of R&D expenditures for tax purposes under Section 174.

We operate and manage our business as 
one
 reportable segment, which is the business of developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. Our 
Chief Executive Officer
, as 
the CODM, uses consolidated net loss to evaluate our expenditures and monitor budget versus actual results.
 The monitoring of budgeted versus actual results and cash on hand are used in assessing performance of the segment and in establishing resource allocation across the organization.
Factors used in determining the reportable segment include the nature of our operating activities, the organizational and reporting structure and the type of information reviewed by the CODM to allocate resources and evaluate financial performance.

102

Significant expenses within net loss include research and development, general and administrative, interest expense, interest income and other, net and income tax expense, which are each separately presented on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Our long-lived assets primarily consist of right-of-use assets related to operating leases, which are located in the United States.

12. Subsequent Events
On February 3, 2025, we completed an underwritten public offering consisting of 
25,957,142
 shares of common stock at an offering price of $
8.75
 per share, including 
4,285,714
 shares of common stock upon the exercise in full of the overallotment option by the underwriters, as well as pre-funded warrants to purchase 
6,900,000
 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $
8.749
 per underlying share, in each case before underwriting discounts and commissions. We raised net proceeds of approximately $
269.9
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
17.3
 million and other offering costs of $
0.3
 million.

Item 9A. Controls
 and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2024, our management, with the participation and supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

As of December 31, 2024, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (“2013 Framework”). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as defined in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
