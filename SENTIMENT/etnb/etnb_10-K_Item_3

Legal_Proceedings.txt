FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, business trends and other information referred to in “Business,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “objective,” “intend,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “would,” “expect,” “believe,” “design,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “target,” “forecast,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts and reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth in “Risk Factors,” and the following risks, uncertainties and factors:

•
our plans to develop and commercialize pegozafermin or any future product candidates;

•
our ongoing and planned clinical trials;

•
the timing of and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for pegozafermin or any future product candidates;

•
our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, needs for additional financing, and the sufficiency of our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;

•
our ability to obtain additional capital;

•
supply chain interruptions, delays in patient enrollment or other delays in our clinical trials;

•
our ability to identify additional products or product candidates with significant commercial potential that are consistent with our commercial objectives;

•
the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of pegozafermin or any future product candidates, if approved;

•
our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy;

•
the expected potential benefits of strategic collaboration with third parties and our ability to attract collaborators with development, regulatory and commercialization expertise;

•
regulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or our competitors’ products and product candidates;

•
our intellectual property position;

•
loss of key members of management;

•
failure to successfully execute our growth strategy, including any delays in our planned future growth;

•
our inability to comply with, and the effect on our business of, evolving legal standards and regulations, including concerning data protection and consumer privacy and sustainability;

•
geopolitical instability, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas and the rising tensions between China and Taiwan, and the macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, general economic slowdown or a recession, rising interest rates, changes in monetary

policy, instability in financial institutions, and changes in trade policies, including tariffs or other trade restrictions or the threat of such actions;

•
our failure to maintain effective internal controls; and

•
the risk that our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by other political, economic, business and competitive factors.

There may be other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including factors disclosed in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in the context of these risks and uncertainties.

We caution you that the risks, uncertainties and other factors referred to above may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results, benefits or developments that we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our business in the way expected. All forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K apply only as of the date made and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
