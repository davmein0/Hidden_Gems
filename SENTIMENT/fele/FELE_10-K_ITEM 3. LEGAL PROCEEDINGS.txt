ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Discussion of the year-over-year comparison of changes in the Company's financial condition and results of operation as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
2024 vs. 2023 
OVERVIEW
Net sales in 2024 
decreased 2 percent co
mpared to the prior year.  The sales decrease in 2024 was primarily due to lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the incremental sales impact from recent acquisitions. The Company's consolidated gross profit was
 $717.3 m
illion for 2024, an increase of $20.3 million from the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was $3.86 for 2024, a decrease of $0.25 or 6 percent from the prior year. 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Sales
Net sales in 2024 were
 $2.0 billion and decreased 2 percent co
mpared to the prior year. Sales were negatively impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, principally due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Argentine Peso, Turkish Lira and Brazilian Real. However, the Company increases prices in the local currency to offset the impact of currency devaluation in the Argentina and Turkey highly inflationary economies. As a result, the net negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales was 1 percent in 2024.

Net Sales-Water Systems
Water Systems net sales 
decreased 2 percent 
in 2024, as compared to the prior year. This sales decline was primarily due to lower volumes, which decreased due to weaker end market demand for large dewatering equipment. Additionally, net sales 
decreased 2 percent 
in 2024 due to the negative impact from foreign exchange rates, as compared to prior year while the incremental sales impact from recent acquisitions favorably impacted sales 1 percent in 2024.
Water Systems net sales in the U.S. and Canada d
ecreased 5 percent
 in 2024, as compared to the prior year. In 2024, sales of large dewatering equipmen
t decreased 41 percent, s
ales of water treatment products increased 11 percent, sales of groundwater pumping equipme
nt increased 4 percent an
d sales of all other surface pumping equipment
 increased 5 percent compared to 
2023.  
Water Systems net sales in markets outside the U.S. and Canad
a increased 4 percent in 2024
, as compared to the prior year. Sales
 decreased 4 pe
rcent in 2024 due to the negative impact from foreign exchange rates, as compared to prior year.  In 2024 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, sales increased in all three major regions: EMEA, Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Net Sales-Energy Systems
Energy Systems net sale
s decreased 8 percent in 2024
, as compared to the prior year. This sales decline was primarily due to lower volumes. 
Energy Systems net sales in the U.S. and Canada 
decreased 3 percent in 2024, as compared to the prior year. Outside the U.S. and Canada, Energy Systems sales decreased 18 percent in 2024, as compared to the prior year. The decreases were across all product lines.
15
Net Sales-Distribution
Distribution net sale
s increased 2 percent in 2024
, as compared to the prior year. The Distribution segment sales increase was primarily due to the incremental sales impact from a recent acquisition, which favorably impacted net sales by 3 percent, partially offset by the negative impact of commodity pricing declines and unfavorable weather.

The SG&A expenses ratio was 23.3 percent and 21.0 percent in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Restructuring Expenses
Restructuring expenses were
 $3.5 million
 and $1.1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Restructuring actions in 2024 were primarily related to headcount reductions and facility closures to optimize the Company's cost structure. Restructuring expenses in 2023 were primarily from continued miscellaneous manufacturing realignment activities, branch closings and consolidations.

Operating Income-Water Systems
Water Systems operating income in 
2024
 was $197.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million as compared to the prior year. The 
2024
 operating income margin was 16.7 percent, an increase of 40 basis points from 16.3 percent in 
2023
. Operating income and operating margin increased in 
2024
 primarily due to price realization, cost management and a favorable product and geographic sales mix shift.
Operating Income-Energy Systems
Energy Systems operating income in 2024 was $93.6 million, an
 increase of $0.9 million
 as compared to the prior year. The 2024 operating income margin was 34.
2 percent, an increase of 290 basis points 
from 31.3 percent in 2023. Operating income and operating margin increased primarily due to a favorable geographic mix of sales, price realization and cost management.
Operating Income-Distribution
Distribution operating income in 2024 was $24.3 million, 
a decrease of $10.0 million
 as compared to the prior-year period. The 2024 operating income margin was 3.
5 percent, a decrease of 160 basis points from 
5.1 percent in 2023. Operating income and operating income margin decreased in 2024 primarily due to the negative impact on sales from wet weather across much of the United States, decreases in pricing of commodity-based products sold through the business and increased SG&A costs.
16
Operating Income-Corporate Expenses and Eliminations
Operating income-corporate expenses and eliminations is composed primarily of intersegment sales and profit eliminations and unallocated general and administrative expenses. The intersegment profit elimination impact in 2024 compared to 2023 was an unfavorable 
$2.7 million. T
he intersegment elimination of operating income effectively defers the operating income on sales from Water Systems to Distribution in the consolidated financial results until such time as the transferred product is sold from the Distribution segment to its end third party customer. General and administrative expense
s increased $8.3 million, co
mpared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by to higher employee compensation costs, including incremental expenses associated with the Company’s CEO transition.
Interest Expense
Interest expense wa
s $6.3 million in 2024 and $11.8 million in 
2023, respectively. The decrease in 2024 was primarily driven by lower average borrowings in 2024.
Other Income or Expense
Other income (expense), net was a benefit of $1.3 million in 2024 and $3.7 million in 2023. The benefit in 2024 was lower than 2023 due to lower interest income realized in Argentina as excess cash balances and interest rates have declined in 2024 compared to 2023.
Foreign Exchange
Foreign currency-based transactions produced an
 expense of $6.8 
million in 2024 and $12.1 million in 2023, respectively. The expense in 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to transaction losses associated with the Turkish Lira and A
rgentine Peso relative to the U.S. dollar.
 The Company reports the results of its subsidiaries in Argentina and Turkey using highly inflationary accounting, which requires that the functional currency of the entity be changed to the reporting currency of its parent. 
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes in 2024 and 2023 were $50.2 million and $47.5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2024 was about 22 percent and included a favorable benefit from discrete events of 1 percent. The effective tax rate for 2023 was about 20 percent and included a favorable benefit from discrete events of 1 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to U.S. states taxes, foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and nondeductible officer’s compensation, partially offset by the recognition of the U.S. foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) provisions, certain incentives, and discrete events.
Net Income
Net income for 2024 was $181.6 million compared to 2023 net income of $194.7 million. Net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. for 2024 was $180.3 million, or $3.86 per diluted share, compared to 2023 net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. of $193.3 million, or $4.11 per diluted share.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
Sources of Liquidity
The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations, revolving credit agreements, and long-term debt funds available. The Company believes its capital resources and liquidity position at December 31, 2024 is adequate to meet projected needs for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operations, capital expenditures, pension obligations, dividends, share repurchases, and debt service will be adequately funded from cash on hand, operations, and existing credit agreements. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had a $350.0 million revolving credit facility. The facility is scheduled to mature on May 13, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $304.1 million borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement as $4.5 million in letters of commercial and standby letters of credit were outstanding and undrawn and $41.4 million in revolver borrowings were drawn or outstanding.   
In addition, the Company maintains an uncommitted and unsecured private shelf agreement with NYL Investors LLC, an affiliate of New York Life, and each of the undersigned holders of Notes (the "New York Life Agreement"). On May 15, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 that increased the total available facility amount from lenders to $250.0 million from $200.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining borrowing capacity on the New York Life Agreement was $175.0 million. The Company also maintains an uncommitted and unsecured note purchase and private shelf agreement with PGIM, Inc. and its affiliates (the "Prudential Agreement"). On May 15, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 that increased the total available facility amount from lenders to $250.0 million from $150.0 million. The maturity dates of both agreements were extended from July 30, 2024 to May 15, 2027.
17
At December 31, 2024, the Company had $47.1 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions, which the Company intends to use to fund foreign operations. There is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
2024 vs 2023
Net cash provided by operating activities was $261.4 million for 2024 compared to $315.7 million for 2023. The change in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to changes in working capital and lower earnings. In 2023, the Company's cash flow benefited from actions it took to improve working capital including inventory reductions as its supply chain resiliency and lead times improved significantly compared to 2022.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
2024 vs. 2023
Net cash used in investing activities was $45.6 million in 2024 compared to $74.3 million in 2023. The change in investing cash flow was primarily attributable to decreased acquisition activity in 2024.
In February 2025, the Company acquired 100 percent of the ownership interests of PumpEng for a purchase price of AUD 24.0 million (approximately $15 million), subject to working capital and net debt closing adjustments. Also in February 2025, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Barnes for an enterprise value of $110.0 million, subject to working capital and net debt closing adjustments. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including Colombian antitrust clearance, and is expected to close on or about March 1, 2025.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
2024 vs. 2023
Net cash used by financing activities was $74.1 million in 2024 compared to $192.2 million in 2023. The change in financing cash flow was primarily due to net borrowings under the Company's credit facility in 2024 compared to net repayments in 2023, partially offset by lower proceeds from option exercises, increased share repurchase activity and higher dividends.
AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The majority of the Company’s contractual obligations to third parties relate to debt obligations. In addition, the Company has certain contractual obligations for future lease payments and purchase obligations. The payment schedule for these contractual obligations is as follows:

Interest payments on debt obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2024. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2024. 
18
The Company has pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations not included in the table above which will result in estimated future payments of approximately $7.3 million in 2025. In addition, due to the timing of funding in future periods being uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates, investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables, the table above excludes the non-current liability of $24.1 million for cash outflows related to the Company's pension plans.
The Company also has unrecognized tax benefits, none of which are included in the table above. The unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1.3 million have been recorded as liabilities and the Company is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, the Company has also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.1 million.
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2 - Accounting Pronouncements
, 
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the sections entitled ""Adoption of New Accounting Standards" and "Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted", included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There were no material changes to estimates or methodologies used to develop those estimates in 2024. The Company’s critical accounting estimates are identified below:
Inventory Valuation
The Company uses certain estimates and judgments to value inventory. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews its inventories for excess or obsolete products or components. Based on an analysis of historical usage, management’s evaluation of estimated future demand, market conditions, and alternative uses for possible excess or obsolete parts, carrying values are adjusted. The carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated product demand. If actual demand differs from the estimates, additional reductions would be necessary in the period such determination is made. Excess and obsolete inventory is periodically disposed of through sale to third parties, scrapping, or other means.

Business Combinations and Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets
The Company follows the guidance under FASB ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
. The acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The Company utilizes management estimates and may use an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed. The identifiable intangible assets acquired typically include customer relationships and trade names. Identifiable intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The fair value of customer relationships is measured using the multi-period excess earnings method ("MPEEM"). The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty ("RFR") approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted amount of cash flows that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. Higher royalty rates are assigned to premium brands within the marketplace based on name recognition and profitability, while other brands receive lower royalty rates. The basis for future sales projections for both the RFR and MPEEM are based on internal revenue forecasts which the Company believes represents reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable discount rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset.  The key uncertainties in the RFR and MPEEM calculations, as applicable, are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, assumptions used in developing estimates of future cash flows, including revenue growth and expense forecasts, assumed customer attrition rates, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the discount rate and risk premium.  There is inherent uncertainty in forecasted future cash flows and therefore, actual results may differ and could result in subsequent impairment charges of acquired intangible assets and/or goodwill.
19
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset and Goodwill Impairment Evaluation
According to FASB ASC Topic 350, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other
, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently as warranted by triggering events that indicate potential impairment. The Company has the option to assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is not required to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, or if it does not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, it performs a quantitative impairment test.
The Company uses a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments including qualitative reviews as well as quantitative reviews using the income and market approaches.
The market value approach compares the reporting units’ current and projected financial results to entities of similar size and industry to determine the market value of the reporting unit. The income approach utilizes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These cash flows consider factors regarding expected future operating income and historical trends, as well as the effects of demand and competition. The Company is required to record an impairment if these assumptions and estimates change whereby the fair value of the reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets are below their associated carrying values.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed its annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names. The Company determined it was not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units were lower than their carrying values. The Company also determined the fair value of all other indefinite-lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values. Significant judgment is required to determine if an indication of impairment has taken place. Factors to be considered include the following: adverse changes in operating results, decline in strategic business plans, significantly lower future cash flows, and sustainable declines in market data such as market capitalization. A 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of any of the indefinite-lived trade names would not have changed this determination. The sensitivity analysis required the use of numerous subjective assumptions, which, if actual experience varies, could result in material differences in the requirements for impairment charges. Further, an extended downturn in the economy may impact certain components of the operating segments more significantly and could result in an impairment determination.
Income Taxes
Under the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, the Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company analyzes the deferred tax assets and liabilities for their future realization based on the estimated existence of sufficient taxable income. This analysis considers the following sources of taxable income: prior year taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies that would generate taxable income in the relevant period. If sufficient taxable income is not projected then the Company will record a valuation allowance against the relevant deferred tax assets. 
The Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. These jurisdictions have different tax rates, and the Company determines the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions. In the normal course of business, the Company will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions. Such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. Although the Company has recorded all income tax uncertainties in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, these accruals represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process. Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, which, if actual experience varies, could result in material adjustments to tax expense and/or deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
Pension and Employee Benefit Obligations
The Company consults with its actuaries to assist with the calculation of discount rates used in its pension and post retirement plans. The discount rates used to determine domestic pension and post-retirement plan liabilities are calculated using a full yield curve approach. Market conditions have caused the weighted-average discount rate to move from 4.90 percent last year to 5.48 
20
percent this year for the domestic pension plans and from 4.88 percent last year to 5.47 percent this year for the postretirement health and life insurance plan. A change in the discount rate selected by the Company of 25 basis points would result in a change of about $0.1 million to employee benefit expense and a change of about $2.4 million of liability.
The Company consults with actuaries and investment advisors in making its determination of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Using input from these consultations such as long-term investment sector expected returns, the correlations and standard deviations thereof, and the plan asset allocation, the Company will use an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.75 percent in measuring net periodic cost for 2025. Market conditions have caused the expected long-term rate or return to decrease from 6.20 percent as used in measuring net periodic cost for 2024. A change in the long-term rate of return selected by the Company of 25 basis points would result in a change of about $0.3 million of employee benefit expense. 
FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
This annual report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking information, such as statements about the Company’s financial goals, acquisition strategies, financial expectations including anticipated revenue or expense levels, business prospects, market positioning, product development, manufacturing re-alignment, capital expenditures, tax benefits and expenses, and the effect of contingencies or changes in accounting policies. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “may increase,” “may fluctuate,” “plan,” “goal,” “target,” “strategy,” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.” While the Company believes that the assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements are reasonable based on present conditions, forward-looking statements made by the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including general economic and currency conditions, various conditions specific to the Company’s business and industry, new housing starts, weather conditions, epidemics and pandemics, market demand, competitive factors, changes in distribution channels, supply constraints, effect of price increases, raw material costs, technology factors, integration of acquisitions, litigation, government and regulatory actions, the Company’s accounting policies, and other risks, all as described in Item 1A and Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are based upon information presently available. The Company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking information, except as required by law.
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. These exposures are actively monitored by management. Exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs, revenue and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of the Company’s subsidiaries functional currency. Similarly, the Company is exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of financing.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Foreign currency exchange rate risk is mitigated through several means including maintenance of local production facilities in the markets served, invoicing of customers in the currency which the Company is billed for production inputs, prompt settlement of third party and intercompany balances, limited use of foreign currency denominated debt, maintaining minimal foreign currency denominated cash balances, and application of derivative instruments when appropriate. Based on the 2024 mix of foreign currencies, the Company estimates that a hypothetical strengthening of the US Dollar by about 2 percent would have reduced the Company’s 2024 sales by less than 1 percent.
Interest Rate Risk
The results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Borrowings in USD under the Credit Agreement may be made either at (i) a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Term

Benchmark plus an applicable margin or (ii) an alternative base rate as defined in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings in EUR under the Credit Agreement may be made either at (i) a Euro Interbank Offer Rate (EURIBOR) Term Benchmark plus an applicable margin or (ii) an alternative base rate as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company had $41.4 million borrowings at year-end 2024 under the Credit Agreement. The Company estimates that a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased interest expense by $0.3 million during 2024. The Company also has exposure to changes in interest rates in the form of the fair value of outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuating in response to changing interest rates. 
21
Commodity Price Exposures
Portions of the Company’s business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as copper, steel and aluminum, among others. The primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts. The Company generally maintains long-term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts; however, the Company is prone to exposure as these contracts expire. Based on the 2024 use of commodities, the Company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would result in less than 1 percent decrease of gross margin as a percent of net sales.

--The financial statements and accompanying notes are as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and referred to as 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Principles of Consolidation
--The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Business Combinations
--The Company allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests based upon their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The Company utilizes management estimates and may use inputs from an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining these fair values. The excess of the acquisition price over estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is adjusted for any changes to acquisition date fair value amounts made within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. If the preliminary, estimated fair values of the net assets acquired are in excess of the acquisition price, that represents a bargain purchase gain, and the Company records this amount in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet until it completes its determination of fair values for the net assets acquired. Once that fair value determination is completed, the bargain purchase gain is recognized on the consolidated statements of income in "Other income/(expense), net". Acquisition-related transaction costs are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
--Revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The promise in a contract to transfer goods or services to a customer represents a performance obligation. The Company typically sells its products to customers by purchase order and does not have any additional performance obligations included in contracts to customers. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. Therefore, the Company allocates the transaction price based on a single performance obligation. The Company typically ships products Free on Board (FOB) shipping point at which point control of the products passes to the customers. The Company considers the performance obligation satisfied and recognizes revenue at a point in time, the time of shipment. The Company applies a practical expedient to expense as incurred costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less as well as applies the financing component practical expedient when the duration of the financing is one year or less.
The Company’s products may include routine assurance-type warranties which do not qualify as separate performance obligations. In the event that significant post-shipment obligations were to exist for the Company’s products, revenue recognition would be deferred until the performance obligations were satisfied.

The Company records net sales after discounts at the time of sale based on specific discount programs in effect, related historical data, and experience.

Shipping and Handling Costs
--
Shipping and handling costs are considered activities required to fulfill the Company’s promise to transfer goods, and do not qualify as a separate performance obligation. Shipping and handling costs in the Company's Water Systems and Energy Systems segments are recorded as a component of cost of sales whereas shipping and handling costs in the Company's Distribution segment are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.
Research and Development Expense
--The Company’s research and development activities are charged to expense in the period incurred. The Company incurred expenses of approximately $
21.5
 million in 2024, $
17.7
 million in 2023, and $
16.7
 million in 2022 related to research and development.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
--The Company considers cash on hand, demand deposits, and highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
--Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standard established a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value within the hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;
Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
29
Accounts Receivable, Earned Discounts, and Allowance for Credit Losses
--Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. Accounts receivable are comprised of balances due from customers, net of earned discounts and estimated allowances for credit losses. Earned discounts are based on specific customer agreement terms. In determining allowances for credit losses, historical collection experience, current trends and reasonable, supportable future forecasts, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic credit evaluations of customers’ financial condition are reviewed.

Inventories
--Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The majority of the cost of inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method with a portion of inventory costs determined using the average cost method. The Company reviews its inventories for excess or obsolete products or components based on an analysis of historical usage and management’s evaluation of estimated future demand, market conditions, and alternative uses for possible excess or obsolete parts.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
--Property, plant, and equipment are stated at historical cost. The Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, which are included in property, plant, and equipment. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives:
Land improvement and buildings
10
 - 
40
 years
Machinery and equipment
5
 - 
10
 years
Software
3
 - 
7
 years
Furniture and fixtures
3
 - 
7
 years
Maintenance, repairs, and renewals of a minor nature are expensed as incurred. Betterments and major renewals which extend the useful lives or add to the productive capacity of buildings, improvements, and equipment are capitalized. The Company reviews its property, plant, and equipment for impairment at the asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If an indicator is present, the Company compares carrying values to undiscounted future cash flows; if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value.
The Company’s depreciation expense was $
37.2
 million, $
35.1
 million, and $
33.1
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Leases--
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and determines whether it is an operating or financing lease. Operating and financing leases result in the Company recording a right-of-use ("ROU") asset, current lease liability, and long term lease liability on its balance sheet. The Company has elected to not present leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. The ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Initial direct costs and lease incentives are generally not material when measuring the ROU asset present value. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
In determining the present value of the ROU liability, the Company utilizes interest rates from lease agreements unless the lease agreement does not provide a readily determinable rate. In these instances, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate based on the Company’s borrowing information available at inception of the lease. A portion of the Company’s leases include renewal options. The Company excludes these renewal options in the expected lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. In addition, the Company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components when initially recording the ROU asset and liability.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
--Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company has the option to assess goodwill for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if it does not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the quantitative impairment test, the Company calculates the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that its carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
30
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as certain trade names with indefinite lives, are subject to an impairment review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company has the option to assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first performing qualitative assessments to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the carrying amounts. If the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if the Company elects not to perform an initial qualitative assessment, the Company then performs the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Company writes the carrying amount down to the fair value.
Amortization is recorded and calculated for definite-lived intangible assets on a basis that reflects cash flows over the estimated useful lives. 
The estimated useful lives over which each intangible class is amortized is as follows:

Customer relationships
9
 - 
20
 years
Patents
17
 years
Technology
15
 years
Trade names
5
 - 
20
 years
Other
5
 - 
8
 years
Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever a triggering event, including a significant change in the use of the asset or unexpected change in financial condition, occurs that indicates the carrying value may be impaired. The Company tests for impairment at the asset group level by comparing the carrying value of an asset group that includes the applicable definite lived intangible asset(s) to that asset group's undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible asset(s) is higher than the fair value, and the Company would record an impairment charge for the difference.

Warranty Obligations
--The Company provides warranties on most of its products. The warranty terms vary but are generally 
2
 years to 
5
 years from the date of manufacture or 
1
 year to 
5
 years from the date of installation. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims. The Company actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims.
Income Taxes
--Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions by establishing a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Defined Benefit Plans
--The Company makes its determination for pension, post retirement, and post employment benefit plans liabilities based on management estimates and consultation with actuaries. The Company incorporates estimates and assumptions of future plan service costs, future interest costs on projected benefit obligations, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, expected investment returns on plan assets, asset allocation assumptions of plan assets, and other factors.
Earnings Per Common Share
--The Company utilizes the two-class method to compute earnings available to common shareholders. Under the two-class method, the Company allocates net earnings to each class of common stock and participating security as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed. The Company’s participating securities consist of share-based payment awards that contain a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends and therefore are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net earnings allocated to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings allocable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards and non-employee deferred shares.
Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements
--All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at year-end exchange rates. All revenue and expense accounts are translated at 
31
average rates in effect during the respective period. Transaction gains and losses and highly inflationary accounting adjustments are included in “Foreign exchange expense” within the Company’s consolidated statements of income, as incurred.
In the second quarter of 2022, the Company concluded that Turkey represents a highly inflationary economy as its three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent. As a result, the Company started remeasuring the financial statements for the Company’s Turkish operations in accordance with the highly inflationary accounting rules as of April 1, 2022. As a result, all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial results of operations and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings rather than as a component of the Company’s comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity. Additionally, the Company’s operations in Argentina have also been accounted for using the highly inflationary accounting rules since the date they were acquired in 2018.
Significant Estimates
--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, actual results could materially differ. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional and more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this ASU in 2024 and the required disclosures are included in Note 15 - Segment and Geographic Information.
Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. ASU 2023-09 is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This amendment modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) (disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes) as well as individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid net of refunds, (3) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (disaggregated between domestic and foreign) and (4) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (disaggregated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, while retrospective application is permitted. 
The Company will adopt this ASU effective with its 2025 annual financial statements and does not anticipate the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, which requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement. The standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented in the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The requirements should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its disclosures.

ACQUISITIONS
2024
During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of FSHS Incorporated, a water treatment systems distributor.  The all-cash purchase price for the acquisition was $
4.5
 million. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is preliminary as of December 31, 2024.
2023
During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Aqua Systems of Fort Myers, a water treatment systems distributor.  In another separate transaction, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Action Manufacturing and Supply, Inc., a water treatment equipment provider located in southwest Florida. The 
32
Company also acquired, in a separate transaction, substantially all of the assets of LCA Pump, LLC, which operates Water Works Pump, a Missouri based professional groundwater distributor. The combined, all-cash purchase price for the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $
36.0
 million, including contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of $
4.3
 million, after purchase price adjustments based on the level of working capital acquired. In 2024, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment of $
1.3
 million to increase the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration transferred. The measurement period adjustment resulted in an increase to acquired identifiable intangible assets of $
2.3
 million and a reduction to acquired goodwill of $
1.0
 million. The measurement period adjustments did not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations. 
During the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Phil-Good Products, Inc. ("Phil-Good"). Phil-Good is an injection molded plastics component manufacturer. In another separate transaction in the first quarter of 2023, the Company acquired 
100
 percent of the ownership interests of Hydropompe S.r.l. ("Hydropompe"). Hydropompe is a pump manufacturer with a focus in dewatering and sewage products. The combined, all-cash purchase price for both acquisitions in the first quarter of 2023 was $
8.7
 million after purchase price adjustments based on the level of working capital acquired.
The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for all 2023 acquisitions is final as of December 31, 2024.  
2022
During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired 
100
 percent of the ownership interests of Casper Well Products ("Casper") for a purchase price of $
2.0
 million after working capital adjustments. Casper conducts the sale and distribution of pumps, drilling equipment, tanks, pipe, accessories and other equipment used in drilling water wells and distribution of water-related products. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was final as of December 31, 2023. 
The Company has not included various disclosures for the 2022 through 2024 acquisitions including presenting separate results of operations of any of the acquired companies since the closing of the acquisitions or combined pro forma financial information of the Company and the acquired interests, as the Company does not consider any of the acquisitions to be material individually or in the aggregate.
Transaction costs for all acquisition-related activity were expensed as incurred under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations. 
Transaction costs are included in the "Selling, general, and administrative expenses" line of the Company’s consolidated statements of income and were immaterial for all periods presented.
Subsequent Event
In February 2025, the Company acquired 
100
 percent of the ownership interests of PumpEng Pty Ltd ("PumpEng") for a purchase price of AUD 
24.0
 million (approximately $
15.0
 million), subject to working capital and net debt closing adjustments. PumpEng, based in Australia, specializes in the design, manufacture and service of submersible pumps for the mining sector. The Company expects the purchase price to be primarily allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
Also in February 2025, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Barnes de Colombia S.A., a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial and commercial pumps based in Colombia for an enterprise value of $
110.0
 million, subject to working capital and net debt closing adjustments. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including Colombian antitrust clearance, and is expected to close on or about March 1, 2025.

New York Life Agreement
On May 27, 2015, the Company entered into an uncommitted and unsecured private shelf agreement with NYL Investors LLC, an affiliate of New York Life, and each of the undersigned holders of Notes (the “New York Life Agreement”) for $
150.0
 million maximum aggregate principal borrowing capacity. On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement. The Amendment was intended to make the covenants within the New York Life Agreement consistent with the covenants that were modified in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). On September 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement which increased the aggregate borrowing capacity to $
200.0
 million and authorized the issuance of $
75.0
 million of fixed rate senior noted due September 26, 2025. These senior notes bear an interest rate of 
4.04
 percent with interest-only payments due semi-annually. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to pay off existing variable rate indebtedness with New York Life. On July 30, 2021, the New York Life agreement was renewed with an expiration date of July 30, 2024. On May 15, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the renewal that increased the total available facility amount from lenders to $
250.0
 million from $
200.0
 million and changed the expiration date from July 30, 2024 to May 15, 2027. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
175.0
 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the New York Life Agreement. 
Project Bonds
On December 31, 2012, the Company, Allen County, Indiana and certain institutional investors entered into a Bond Purchase and Loan Agreement. Under the agreement, Allen County, Indiana issued a series of Project Bonds entitled “Taxable Economic Development Bonds, Series 2012 (Franklin Electric Co., Inc. Project).” The aggregate principal amount of the Project Bonds that were issued, authenticated, and are now outstanding thereunder was limited to $
25.0
 million. The Company then borrowed the proceeds under the Project Bonds through the issuance of Project Notes to finance the cost of acquisition, construction, installation and equipping of the new Global Corporate Headquarters and Engineering Center. These Project Notes (“Tax increment financing debt”) bear interest at

 percent per annum. Interest and principal balance of the Project Notes are due and payable by the Company directly to the institutional investors in aggregate semi-annual installments commencing on July 10, 2013, and concluding on January 10, 2033. The use of the proceeds from the Project Notes was limited to assist the financing of the new Global Corporate Headquarters and Engineering Center.

110.0
 million on April 30, 2007 (the “B-1 Notes”) and $
40.0
 million on September 7, 2007 (the “B-2 Notes”). The B-1 Notes and B-2 Notes bear a coupon of

35
EBITDA ratio covenant in order to be equivalent to that under the Agreement. On December 31, 2012, the Company and Prudential Insurance Company of America entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement to extend the effective date to December 31, 2015. On May 5, 2015, the Company entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Second Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement. This amendment provided for debt repayment guarantees from certain Company subsidiaries and waived certain non-financial covenants related to subsidiary guarantees. On May 28, 2015, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential to increase the total borrowing capacity from $
200.0
 million to $
250.0
 million. On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Third Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement. This amendment was intended to make the covenants within the Prudential Agreement consistent with the covenants that were modified in the Credit Agreement (below). On July 30, 2021, the Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, which reduced the borrowing capacity to $
150.0
 million and extended the expiration date to July 30, 2024. On May 15, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Fourth Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement that increased the total available facility amount from lenders to $
250.0
 million from $
150.0

250.0
 million borrowing capacity available under the Prudential Agreement.
Credit Agreement
On May 13, 2021, the Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of the Company’s previous credit agreement to May 13, 2026, and decreased the commitment amount from $
300.0
 million to $
250.0
 million. On May 11, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 that increased the commitment amount from $
250.0
 million to $
350.0
 million. The Credit Agreement provides that the Borrowers may request an increase in the aggregate commitments by up to $
125.0
 million (not to exceed a total commitment of $

All of the Company’s present and future material domestic subsidiaries unconditionally guaranty all of the Borrowers’ obligations under and in connection with the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Company unconditionally guaranties all of the obligations of Franklin Electric B.V. under the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers are required to pay certain fees, including a facility fee of 
0.100
 percent to 
0.275
 percent (depending on the Company’s leverage ratio) of the aggregate commitment, payable quarterly in arrears. USD loans may be made either at (i) a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Term

The affirmative covenants relate to financial statements, notices of material events, conduct of business, inspection of property, maintenance of insurance, compliance with laws and most favored lender obligations. The negative covenants include limitations on loans, advances and investments, and the granting of liens by the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as prohibitions on certain consolidations, mergers, sales and transfers of assets. The covenants also include financial requirements including a maximum leverage ratio of 
3.50
 to 
1.00
 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 
3.00
 to 
1.00
. Cross default is applicable with the Credit Agreement, the Prudential Agreement, the Project Bonds, and the New York Life Agreement, but only if the Company is defaulting on an obligation exceeding $
10.0
 million. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2024.

7. 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In 2011, the Company became aware of a review of alleged issues with certain underground piping connections installed in filling stations in France owned by the French Subsidiary of Exxon Mobile, Esso S.A.F. A French court ordered that a designated, subject-matter expert review 103 filling stations to determine what, if any, damages are present and the cause of 
36
those damages. The Company has participated in this investigation since 2011, along with several other third parties including equipment installers, engineering design firms who designed and provided specifications for the stations, and contract manufacturers of some of the installed equipment. In May 2022, the subject-matter expert issued its final report, which indicates that total damages incurred by Esso amounted to approximately 
9.5
 million Euro. It is the Company’s position that its products were not the cause of any alleged damage. The Company submitted its response to the expert's final report in February  2023. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Any exposure related to this matter is neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time. If payments result from a resolution of this matter, depending on the amount, they could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position,  results of operations, or cash flows.
The Company is defending other various claims and legal actions which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based on current knowledge of the facts and after discussion with counsel, these claims and legal actions can be defended or resolved without a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and net cash flows.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
12.6
 million of commitments primarily for capital expenditures and the purchase of raw materials to be used in production.
At December 31, 2024, the Company has a contingent consideration liability with an estimated fair value of $
5.0
 million, the maximum potential payout, that was paid in early 2025.
The changes in the carrying amount of the warranty accrual, as recorded in the “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” line of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets for 2024 and 2023, are as follows:

8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Share-based Compensation

In 2023, the Company amended The Franklin Electric Co., Inc. 2017 Stock Plan, which is called The Franklin Electric Co., Inc. Amended and Restated 2017 Stock Plan ("the 2017 Amended and Restated Stock Plan") and increased the number of shares available under the Plan by 
900,000
 to 
2,300,000
. The 2017 Amended and Restated Stock Plan is a stock-based compensation plan that provides for discretionary grants of stock options, stock awards, stock unit awards, and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) to key employees and non-employee directors. Stock options and SARs reduce the number of available shares by 
one
 share for each share subject to the option or SAR, and stock awards and stock unit awards settled in shares reduce the number of available shares by 
1.5
 shares for every one share delivered.
The Company also maintains the Franklin Electric Co., Inc. 2012 Stock Plan (the “2012 Stock Plan”), which is a share-based compensation plan that provides for discretionary grants of stock options, stock awards and stock unit awards to key employees and non-employee directors. 
The 2012 Stock Plan authorized 
2,400,000
 shares for issuance as follows: 
2012 Stock Plan
Authorized Shares
Stock Options
1,680,000
Stock/Stock Unit Awards
720,000
No additional options and awards are granted out of the 2012 Stock Plan. However, there are still unvested awards and unexercised options under this plan.
The Company currently issues new shares from its common stock balance to satisfy option exercises and the settlement of stock awards and stock unit awards made under the outstanding stock plans.
The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense only for the portion of shares that it expects to vest. As such, an estimated forfeiture rate is applied to calculate the share-based compensation expense, which is based on historical forfeiture data. The total share-based compensation expense recognized in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
12.1
 million, $
10.1
 million, and $
11.0
 million, respectively. The tax benefit recognized in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
5.0
 million, $
5.6
 million, and $
4.7
 million. Included in the benefit in 2024, 2023, and 2022 were excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $
2.3
 million,  $
3.2
 million, and $
2.1
 million, respectively. 
Stock Options:
Under the above plans, the exercise price of each option equals the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and the options expire 
10
 years after the date of the grant. Options vest at 
33
 percent a year and become fully vested and fully exercisable after 
3
 years. Vesting is accelerated upon retirement, death or disability. Subject to the terms of the plans, in general, the aggregate option exercise price and any applicable tax withholding may be satisfied in cash or its equivalent, by the plan participant’s delivery of shares of the Company’s common stock having a fair market value at the time of exercise equal to the aggregate option exercise price and/or the applicable tax withholding or by having shares otherwise subject to the award withheld by the Company or via cashless exercise through a broker-dealer.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with a single approach and amortized using a straight-line attribution method over the option’s vesting period. Options granted to retirement eligible employees are immediately expensed. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected volatility of its stock, the weighted average expected life, the period of time options granted are expected to be outstanding, and its dividend yield. The risk-free rates for periods within the contractual life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

The table below provides the weighted average grant-date fair values and key assumptions used for the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of options granted during 2024, 2023, and 2022:

2.2
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted under the stock plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.90
 years.
Stock/Stock Unit Awards:
Under the 2017 Stock Plan, non-employee directors and employees may be granted stock awards and stock units. Stock awards to non-employee directors are generally fully vested when made. Stock/stock unit awards to employees cliff vest over 
3
 years (subject to accelerated vesting of a pro rata portion in the case of retirement, death or disability) and may be contingent on the attainment of certain performance goals. Dividends are paid to the recipient prior to vesting, except that dividends on performance-based stock awards under the 2012 Stock Plan and the 2017 Stock Plan will be paid only to the extent the performance goals are met. 
Stock/stock unit awards granted to retirement eligible employees are expensed over the vesting period. Compensation cost for the performance stock/stock unit awards is accrued based on the probable outcome of specified performance conditions.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined Benefit Plans
 - As of December 31, 2024, the Company maintained 
two
 domestic pension plans and 
three
 German pension plans. The Company used a December 31, 2024 measurement date for these plans. One of the Company’s domestic pension plans covers one active management employee, while the other domestic plan covers all eligible employees. Both domestic plans were frozen as of December 31, 2011. The 
two
 domestic and 
three
 German plans collectively comprise the ‘Pension Benefits’ disclosure caption. 
Other Benefits
 - The Company’s other post-retirement benefit plan provides health and life insurance to domestic employees hired prior to 1992. The Company effectively capped its cost for those benefits through plan amendments made in 1992, freezing Company contributions for insurance benefits at 1991 levels for current and future beneficiaries with actuarially reduced benefits for employees who retire before age 
65
. The disclosures surrounding this plan are reflected in the “Other Benefits” caption.
41
The following table sets forth aggregated information related to the Company’s pension benefits and other postretirement benefits, including changes in the benefit obligations, changes in plan assets, funded status, amounts recognized in the balance sheet, amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, and actuarial assumptions that the Company considered in its determination of benefit obligations and plan costs.

The increased discount rate, partially offset by unfavorable returns on assets were the largest contributors to the net actuarial gains recorded in 2024. The decreased discount rate is the largest contributor to the net actuarial losses affecting the benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans in 2023.

The Company consults with a third party investment manager for the assets of the funded domestic defined benefit plan. The plan assets are currently invested primarily in pooled funds, where each fund in turn is composed of mutual funds that have at least daily net asset valuations. Thus, the Company’s funded domestic defined benefit plan assets are invested in a “fund of funds” approach.
The Company’s Board has delegated oversight and guidance to an appointed Employee Benefits Committee. The Committee has the tasks of reviewing plan performance and asset allocation, ensuring plan compliance with applicable laws, establishing plan policies, procedures, and controls, monitoring expenses, and other related activities.
The plan’s investment policies and strategies focus on the ability to fund benefit obligations as they come due. Considerations include the plan’s current funded level, plan design, benefit payment assumptions, funding regulations, impact of potentially volatile business results on the Company’s ability to make certain levels of contributions, and interest rate and asset return volatility among other considerations. The Company currently attempts to maintain plan funded status at approximately 
80
 percent or greater pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2007. Given the plan’s current funded status, the Company’s cash on hand, cash historically generated from business operations, and cash available under committed credit facilities, the Company sees ample liquidity to achieve this goal.
Risk management and continuous monitoring requirements are met through monthly investment portfolio reports, quarterly Employee Benefits Committee meetings, annual valuations, asset/liability studies, and the annual assumption process focusing primarily on the return on asset assumption and the discount rate assumption. 
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, funds were invested in equity, fixed income, and other investments as follows:

The Company does not see any particular concentration of risk within the plans, nor any plan assets that pose difficulties for fair value assessment. The Company currently has no allocation to potentially illiquid or potentially difficult to value assets such as hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and real estate.
The Company works with actuaries and consultants in making its determination of the asset rate of return assumption and also the discount rate assumption. 
Asset class assumptions are set using a combination of empirical and forward-looking analysis for long-term rate of return on plan assets. A variety of models are applied for filtering historical data and isolating the fundamental characteristics of asset classes. These models provide empirical return estimates for each asset class, which are then reviewed and combined with a qualitative assessment of long-term relationships between asset classes before a return estimate is finalized. This provides an 
44
additional means for correcting for the effect of unrealistic or unsustainable short-term valuations or trends, opting instead for return levels and behavior that are more likely to prevail over long periods. With that, the Company has assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 
5.75
 percent for the 2025 net periodic benefit cost, down from 
6.20
 percent in the prior year.
The Company uses the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median curve to determine the discount rate. All cash flow obligations under the plan are matched to bonds in the Aon Hewitt universe of liquid, high-quality, non-callable / non-puttable corporate bonds with outliers removed. From that matching exercise, a discount rate is determined.
The Company’s German pension plans are funded by insurance contract policies whereby the insurance company guarantees a fixed minimum return. Due to tax legislation, individual pension benefits can only be financed using direct insurance policies up to certain maximums. These maximum amounts in respect of each member are paid into such an arrangement on a yearly basis.

The Company designated all equity and most domestic fixed income plan assets as Level 1, as they are mutual funds with prices that are readily available. The U.S. Treasury securities and German plan assets are designated as Level 2 inputs. The fair value of the German plan assets are measured by the reserve that is supervised by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. The U.S. Treasury securities are administered by the United States government. 
The fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets for 2024 and 2023 by asset category are as follows:

The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 
21
 percent primarily due to U.S. state taxes, foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and nondeductible officer’s compensation, which were partially offset by the recognition of the U.S. foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) provisions, certain incentives, and discrete events.
The Company recorded discrete excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $
2.3
 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company recorded an increased benefit in the U.S. foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) provisions related to a prepayment of inventory from foreign subsidiaries, that is unlikely to recur in future periods.

The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss for certain U.S. state and foreign income tax purposes incurred over the 3-year period ended December 31, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company's projections for future growth. 
47
On the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance of $
4.4
 million has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. 
The Company has foreign income tax net operating loss (“NOL”) and credit carryforwards of $
8.1
 million and U.S. state income tax credit carryforwards of $
3.7
 million, which will expire on various dates as follows:

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain foreign NOL carryforwards as well as certain U.S. state credit carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $
3.2
 million on the deferred tax assets related to these foreign NOL carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $
1.2
 million on the deferred tax assets related to these U.S. state credit carryforwards. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has estimated accumulated undistributed earnings generated by the Company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $
542.4
 million. Any taxes due with respect to such earnings or the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of its foreign investments would generally be limited to foreign and U.S. state taxes. The Company intends, however, to indefinitely reinvest these earnings and expects future U.S. cash generation to be sufficient to meet future U.S. cash needs. The Company, therefore, has not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $
4.4
 million.
As of the beginning of 2024, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $
0.8
 million, excluding accrued interest and penalties. The unrecognized tax benefits increased due to uncertain tax positions identified for the current and prior years based on evaluations made during 2024, which were offset by statute expirations. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued interest and penalties, of $
1.3
 million as of December 31, 2024.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024, 2023, and 2022 (excluding interest and penalties) is as follows:

0.9
 million as of year-end 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company has accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 of approximately $
0.1
 million, $
0.1
 million, and $
0.2
 million, respectively.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, as of  December 31, 2024, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2021 and is no longer subject to foreign or U.S. state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019.
It is reasonably possible that the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of an audit or due to the expiration of a statute of limitation. Based on the current audits in process and pending statute expirations, the payment of taxes as a result could be up to $
0.1
 million.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company calculates basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to each class of common stock and participating security as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed. The Company’s participating securities consist of share-based payment awards that contain a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends and therefore are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. 
Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net earnings allocable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings allocated to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company’s non-employee directors' deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and, accordingly, is adjusted for changes in the Company’s stock price at the end of each reporting period. The Company has entered into share swap transaction agreements (“the swap”) to mitigate the Company’s exposure to these fluctuations in the Company’s stock price. The swap has not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes and is cancellable with 
30
 days written notice by either party. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the swap had a notional value based on 
250,000
 shares and 
240,000
 shares, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the swap resulted in a loss of $
1.3
 million, a gain of $
2.5
 million, and a loss of $
3.4
 million, respectively. Gains and losses resulting from the swap were primarily offset by gains and losses on the fair value of the deferred compensation stock liability. All gains or losses and expenses related to the deferred compensation stock liability and the swap are recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income within the “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” line.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business including making sales and purchases of raw materials and finished goods in foreign denominated currencies with third party customers and suppliers as well as to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.  To reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility, the Company enters into various forward currency contracts to offset these fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency contracts only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and to minimize earnings volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not elected to use hedge accounting. Decisions on whether to use such derivative instruments are primarily based on the amount of exposure to the currency involved and an assessment of the near-term market value for each currency.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 
no
 foreign currency contracts outstanding. For the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the forward currency contracts resulted in a loss of $
0.2
 million, a gain of $
1.6
 million, and a gain of $
1.2
 million, respectively. This is recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of income within the "Foreign exchange expense" line.

The Company’s Level 1 cash equivalents assets are generally comprised of foreign bank guaranteed certificates of deposit and short term deposits. The share swap transaction is recorded within the "Accounts Payable" and "Receivables" lines of the consolidated balance sheets and is further described in Note 13 - Financial Instruments.
The Company has no assets measured on a recurring basis classified as Level 2 excluding the recurring fair value measurements in the Company's pension and other retirement plans as discussed in Note 10 - Employee Benefit Plans.
The Company's Level 3 category includes contingent consideration related to acquisitions, which valuation inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.  Projections and estimated probabilities are used to estimate future contingent earn-out payments, which are discounted back to present value to compute contingent earn-out liabilities. 
The following table provides a roll-forward of the contingent consideration liability, which is included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" as of December 31, 2024 and "Other long-term liabilities" as of December 31, 2023 in the consolidated balance sheets:

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The Company’s business consists of the Water Systems, Distribution, and Energy Systems reportable segments, based on the principal end market served. The Company changed the name of the Fueling Systems segment to Energy Systems to reflect its diverse portfolio and growth strategy, as well as to better reflect the markets and customers served by the segment. The Company includes unallocated corporate expenses and intercompany eliminations that are not part of a reportable segment in its reconciliations to consolidated results. 
The Water Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells motors, pumps, electronic controls, water treatment systems and related parts and equipment primarily for use in submersible water or other fluid system applications. The Energy Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells pumps, electronic controls and related parts and equipment primarily for use in submersible fueling system applications. The Energy Systems segment integrates and sells motors and electronic controls produced by the Water Systems segment. The Company reports these product transfers between Water Systems and Energy Systems as inventory transfers since a significant number of the Company's manufacturing facilities are shared across segments for scale and efficiency purposes. The Distribution segment sells to and provides presale support and specifications to the installing contractors. The Distribution segment sells products produced by the Water Systems segment. The Company reports intersegment transfers from Water Systems to Distribution as intersegment sales at market prices to properly reflect the commercial arrangement of vendor to customer that exists between the Water Systems and Distribution segments.
The accounting policies of the Company’s reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company's chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. Performance is evaluated based on the sales and operating income of the segments. Operating income and margin are used to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding whether to reinvest profits into each segment or other parts of the entity.  Operating income is also used to monitor budget versus actual results, for purposes of determining portions of management compensation and for benchmarking against similar measures used by peers and competitors. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented as corporate expenses are not allocated to segments. Interest expense, other income (expense), net, foreign exchange expense and income tax expense are also not allocated to each segment.

The Company offers a large array of products and systems to multiple markets and customers. Product sales information is tracked regionally and products are categorized differently between regions based on local needs and reporting requirements. However, net sales by segment are representative of the Company’s sales by major product category. The Company sells its products through various distribution channels including wholesale and retail distributors, specialty distributors, industrial and petroleum equipment distributors, as well as major oil and utility companies and original equipment manufacturers.
No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company’s net sales in 2024, 2023, or 2022. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company’s gross accounts receivable in 2024 or 2023.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions — Refer to Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements 
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions by establishing a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Accruals for income tax uncertainties represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process.
Because of the numerous taxing jurisdictions in which the Company files its tax returns and the complexity of tax laws and regulations, auditing uncertain tax positions and the determination of whether the more likely than not threshold was met requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our income tax specialists.
55
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to unrecognized tax benefits included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over income taxes, including those over identifying and evaluating uncertain tax positions. 
•
We evaluated, with the assistance of our tax specialists, a selection of the Company’s uncertain tax positions and the Company’s application of the more likely than not principle by performing the following: 
•
Obtaining management memoranda, including, as applicable, third-party specialist memoranda, regarding the analysis of uncertain tax positions and identifying the key judgments and evaluating whether the analysis was consistent with our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations. 
•
Evaluating the matters raised by tax authorities in former and ongoing tax examinations and considering the implications of these matters on open tax years.
•
Assessing changes and interpretation of applicable tax law.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 under the Exchange Act during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting of the Company. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management excluded the asset acquisition of FSHS, Incorporated (Note 3 - Acquisitions) from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as the acquisition occurred in 2024. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. The net sales and total assets of the current year acquisition represented less than 1 percent of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Based on its evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This report appears on page

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Franklin Electric Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at FSHS Incorporated, which was acquired in 2024. This acquired business constitutes less than 1% of net sales and total assets of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at this acquired business.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
