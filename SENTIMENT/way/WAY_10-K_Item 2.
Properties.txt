Properties
Our corporate headquarters are co-located in Lehi, Utah and Louisville, Kentucky. In addition to our headquarters, we have offices in Atlanta, Georgia and Duluth, Georgia. All of our facilities are leased and none of our facilities are used for any purpose other than general office use. We believe that our current facilities meet our needs and we are confident that we will be able to obtain, if needed, additional or different space on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate future growth.
