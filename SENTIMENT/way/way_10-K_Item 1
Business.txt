Our Mission
Our mission is to simplify healthcare payments through our modern cloud-based software, enabling our healthcare clients to prioritize patient care and optimize their financial performance.
Overview
Waystar provides healthcare organizations with mission-critical cloud software that simplifies healthcare payments. Our enterprise-grade platform streamlines the complex and disparate processes our healthcare provider clients must manage to be reimbursed correctly, while improving the payments experience for providers, patients, and payers. We leverage internally developed AI as well as proprietary, advanced algorithms to automate payment-related workflow tasks and drive continuous improvement, which enhances claim and billing accuracy, enriches data integrity, and reduces labor costs for providers.
Put simply, our software helps providers get paid faster, accurately, and more efficiently, while ensuring patients receive a modern, transparent, and consumer-friendly financial experience.
The healthcare payment ecosystem is highly complex, beginning with pre-service patient onboarding and extending through post-service revenue collection, with dozens of interdependent steps in between. Within this multi-step workflow, the process for determining how much a provider should be reimbursed involves millions of permutations of variables, such as over 10,000 diagnosis codes that are constantly changing and unique payer contracts, each with individual rules, processes, and reimbursement requirements. The burden borne by providers of tracking and managing all of these variables, coupled with a constantly evolving regulatory framework, often results in incorrect payments or denials that require time-consuming appeals procedures to resolve. Historically, healthcare providers have relied upon a patchwork of manual processes and systems to navigate these complexities and support their payment functions. However, this legacy approach has resulted in workflow delays, lost revenue, and slower time to payment. Our purpose- built software platform addresses these challenges and optimizes healthcare payments across all stages of the patient journey. Our clients utilize our software to manage pre-encounter workflows such as eligibility checks and prior authorization approvals, as well as mid- and post-encounter workflows such as co-pay collection, claims submission and monitoring, and payer remittances. Our software helps to avoid or reduce billing errors throughout the healthcare payment workflow, from pre-encounter eligibility verification to determine patient insurance eligibility and benefits prior to rendering service, to mid- and post-encounter solutions such as our revenue capture suite which identifies and resolves missing charges and errors in claims submissions by providers, our claims management suite which helps ensure submissions in accordance with payer contracts, and our denial avoidance solution which offers a root cause reporting tool for denied claims to help reduce preventable denials in the future.
Our software is used daily by providers of all types and sizes across the continuum of care, including physician practices, clinics, surgical centers, and laboratories, as well as large hospitals and health systems. We currently serve over 30,000 clients of various sizes, representing over one million distinct providers practicing across a variety of care sites, including 16 of the top 20 U.S. News Best Hospitals. Our client base is highly diversified, and for the year ended December 31, 2024, our top 10 clients accounted for only 11.2% of our total revenue for such period. Our business model is designed such that as our clients grow to serve more patients, their claims and transactional volumes increase, resulting in corresponding growth in our business. In addition, our clients frequently adopt a greater number of our solutions over time and introduce our solutions across new sites of care. In 2024, we facilitated over six billion healthcare payments transactions, including over $1.8 trillion in gross claims volume. As of 2023, we facilitated healthcare payments transactions spanning approximately 50% of patients in the United States.
Our platform benefits from powerful network effects. Our cloud-based software is driven by a sophisticated, automated, and curated rules engine, employing AI to generate and incorporate real-time feedback from millions of network transactions processed through our platform each day. Every transaction we process provides additional data insights across providers, patients, and payers, which are embedded in updates that are deployed efficiently across our client base. This results in cumulative benefits to us over time - as we capture more data from each transaction we process, we leverage that data to continue to improve the Waystar platform through embedded machine learning, advanced algorithms, and other in-house AI technologies to deliver added value to our clients. In turn, the more value we create for our clients, the more likely it is that they will continue to use our products, allowing us to continue to capture more data that results in tangible improvements to our platform. As a result, our clients benefit from faster and more efficient performance from software that is evolving to meet ever-changing regulatory and payer requirements, enabling accurate and timely reimbursement.

Industry Background
Healthcare is one of the largest and most complex vertical end-markets within the U.S. economy, accounting for 17.6% of the U.S. gross domestic product as of 2023. According to CMS, total U.S. healthcare spending was $4.9 trillion in 2023. National health expenditures are expected to grow 5.6% annually reaching $7.6 trillion in 2032, or 19.7% of GDP. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, the annual cost of wasteful spending in healthcare has ranged from $760 billion to $935 billion in recent years, or nearly one-quarter of total healthcare spending. Of this, $350 billion is administrative- related, which is inclusive of healthcare payments-related waste.
The Waystar platform is purpose-built to address the administrative headwinds faced by healthcare providers, including:
●
Antiquated, legacy technology systems and data silos
. The historically slow pace of digital adoption by healthcare organizations has led to a patchwork of disparate point-solutions. These software tools, most of which are hosted or installed on-premises, lack the interoperability and scalability of a modern cloud-based technology architecture, which is designed to enable the safe and efficient dissemination of critical information. This patchwork approach has also led to data silos, which inhibit transparency and data sharing and often result in denials or the inability to process claims efficiently.
●
Reliance on inefficient, manual processes
. Poorly integrated legacy systems have led many healthcare organizations to employ labor-dependent solutions to address the critical demands of their businesses, often resulting in suboptimal financial performance for providers and a substandard experience for patients.
●
Increasing labor and administrative costs
. According to an American Hospital Association report, labor constituted 60% of hospital expenses in 2023. Hospital labor costs increased by $42.5 billion, reaching a total of $839 billion from 2021 to 2023. Over the period from 2014 to 2023, compensation for hospital employees has significantly outpaced overall inflation, with a 45% increase compared to a 28.7% rise in overall inflation.
●
Reimbursement complexity and collection challenges
. Determining reimbursement to a provider from a payer or a patient is dependent on a myriad of factors that are both highly complex and constantly evolving. According to KFF research, approximately 17% of 2021 healthcare claims were initially denied, leaving a significant unmet need for solutions that reduce denials, increase first pass acceptance, and simplify appeals. Providers bear the burden of navigating reimbursement obstacles, and missteps can ultimately result in lost revenue or delayed cash flow. In addition, healthcare providers often struggle to convert patient bills (i.e., patient responsibility) to cash payments as patients are also tasked with navigating ever-changing benefits policies and interacting with outdated technology.
●
Accelerating consumer demand for digital tools
. Patients are bearing a greater burden of healthcare costs than ever before, with more than 50% of American private industry workers enrolling in high deductible health plans according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data (2023). Out-of-pocket costs constituted 10% of total U.S. personal healthcare expenditures in 2023 according to CMS, and the estimated average patient lifetime spending is $1.4 million, based on a 2021 Health Management Academy Research report. Despite these trends, patients lack access to digital tools and accurate information for healthcare payments, such as transparency in insurance coverage and out-of-pocket cost estimates pre-service, as well as flexible payment arrangements to pay for care.
Our Market Opportunity
Over time, administrative workflows (e.g., human resources, information technology, accounting and finance, and customer service) that were traditionally insourced by healthcare providers have undergone a meaningful transformation. Seeking more effective solutions to address industry challenges, providers initially outsourced these functions to third-party specialized services vendors. However, with advances in technology infrastructure and cloud-based software, as well as increased interoperability between systems, providers are increasingly utilizing automated software solutions to further enhance efficiency. We believe the healthcare payments workflow is currently undergoing such an evolution, and that Waystar is well- positioned to benefit from providers gravitating towards more modern, software-oriented solutions.

Table of Contents
We estimate that our TAM with respect to our current software solution set was $15 billion in 2022. To estimate our market opportunity, we categorized the United States healthcare provider market into tiers based on setting of care and size of practice. We then applied our average pricing by product, accounting for pricing differences at varying sized providers, and multiplied the average product price by the corresponding practice count per setting of care to determine our TAM. Based on a third-party study commissioned by the Company, we believe our TAM has the potential to increase to almost $20 billion in 2027, reflecting a 5% CAGR from 2022 to 2027, driven by growth within healthcare payments (notably, in prior authorizations, patient payments, and revenue cycle management analytics), increased outsourcing in revenue cycle management, as well as secular technology tailwinds such as greater utilization of AI. We expect to expand our TAM further over time as we develop new solutions and address adjacent workflows. We believe we have consistently grown in excess of the market since 2016 and expect we will continue to grow our market share in the future by virtue of our differentiated platform and capabilities. We believe the market share of our solutions within the hospital segment and ambulatory practice segment is approximately 4% and 8% (calculated as a percentage of our revenue as compared to our TAM estimates by setting of care), respectively, demonstrating the ample white space in which we can continue driving our growth.
The Waystar Platform
Our innovative cloud-based software platform is purpose-built to simplify our clients’ payment-related challenges. We believe our platform significantly outperforms those of our competitors, who lack either modern functionality or the ability to address the full end-to-end payments workflow.
The key components of our platform include:
●
Modern, differentiated software
. We provide modern, scalable healthcare payments software solutions. Our platform is in alignment with best-in-class offerings in other industry verticals that include multi-tenancy, micro-services architecture, and robust data security. Our technology is cloud- native, allowing us to deploy it across any type and size of provider, from single-physician practices to the most sophisticated multi-site health systems. This single-instance, multi-tenant infrastructure is underpinned by an event-driven microservices architecture, all of which we have built in-house.
●
A comprehensive solution set
. Our software addresses the entire healthcare payments workflow, from pre-service patient onboarding and prior authorization through post-service payment collection. Rather than attacking individual pain points for a client user, our solutions can meet the full demands of an entire organization, eliminating the need for point solutions, boosting productivity through a seamless end-user experience, and reducing the risk of loss of data or information.
●
Seamless integrations
. Our solutions are integrated with a broad range of systems provided by over 200 channel partners, including ERP applications, as well as PM and EHR systems. This deep connectivity is an important point of differentiation and makes our solutions faster to implement, easier to use, and harder to replace.
●
An expansive network
. Our extensive network of clients and counterparties underpins our platform.

Advanced AI capabilities driven by proprietary data asset
. We build predictive scoring capabilities using extensive training data sets and advanced machine learning which we apply to data that passes through our platform. Using these machine-learning models, we are able to predict an outcome for a variety of reimbursement workflows, which we incorporate into our solutions to drive improved results for payers, providers, and patients. Our data asset is comprised of the billions of transactions we facilitate each year as well as the numerous variables that factor into each of those payments. This allows us to leverage the compounding value of this data asset to advance our AI and automation capabilities, which continuously learn and improve our platform. Our data include elements such as demographics, geography, diagnosis and prognosis, and care provider, as well as a variety of counterparty details. For example, we leverage AI in our denials prevention and recovery platform, where it helps us predict denied claim appeals success based on a variety of factors including patient benefits, procedure performed, applicable payer involved, and codes used. This enables providers to prioritize their workflow efforts and drive maximum recovery value on denied claims. In addition, we use AI to discover missing charges and capture otherwise lost revenue, to align claim status and escalation efforts with claim-specific expected remit timeframe, to drive work queue prioritization by expected value, to predict the likelihood of charity qualification driving pre-service financial intervention, and for behavior modeling to align patient collection costs.

We believe that the strengths of our platform and solutions provide us with a significant competitive advantage. Following a recent cybersecurity incident involving one of our competitors, more than 30,000 providers, including a significant number of large health systems and ambulatory providers, began adopting our solutions, and we were able to implement our solutions for many of these new clients in as little as 48 hours. This also allowed us to establish direct connectivity with large, national health plans, who previously had exclusive portal connections with the competitor. We expect to build enduring relationships with these new clients, the vast majority of whom have signed contracts with initial terms of two to three years, with one- year automatic renewals.
Our Growth Strategy
We plan to capitalize on our market opportunity by executing on the following growth strategies:
●
Expand our relationships with existing clients
. We believe we have a meaningful opportunity to continue driving growth within our current client base. We grow with existing clients in three ways- first, as they expand their businesses, provide more healthcare services, and see more patients; second, through cross-selling as they adopt additional Waystar offerings; and third, through up-selling as they leverage our solutions across additional providers and sites of care. We have a track record of building long-standing relationships with our clients, often growing from an initial solution to multi- solution adoption. Based on the estimated whitespace within our existing clients for the solutions we currently provide, we believe we have the opportunity to approximately double our revenue through cross-sell and up-sell of our solutions to existing clients.
●

These acquisitions complement our organic product roadmap and have helped us enhance our platform, add new solutions, and expand our market reach. For example, we acquired eSolutions in 2020, adding Medicare-specific solutions that allow us to address both commercial and government payers on a single cloud-based platform. Our acquisitions are fully integrated with and consolidated into the Waystar platform, which enables us to provide a seamless user experience for our clients, as well as drive innovation on the combined platform. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that improve our offering and accelerate our growth.
Our Solutions
Our comprehensive solution set streamlines the complex and disparate processes relating to payments received by healthcare providers and addresses related pain points for providers, patients, and payers. Our solutions include:
●
Financial clearance
. Our platform automates insurance verification processes and validates that patients are eligible for care through the prior authorization process, helping eliminate downstream rejections and denials that lead to revenue delays and leakage. Based on a Company survey, 81% of patients would more actively pursue care if they knew the cost upfront. Our financial clearance solutions provide patients with price transparency tools and cost estimation data points that offer them better clarity around their expected costs.
●
Patient financial care
. Our platform enables digital interactions between the patient and provider, including delivery of electronic statements and processing of patient payments through our patient portal. We offer an omni-channel payment experience, with multiple ways for patients to pay, as well as flexible payment arrangements. These solutions deliver a better financial experience for patients, as well as faster collection times and higher collection rates for providers.
●
Claims and payer payment management
. Our platform streamlines the cumbersome reimbursement process that providers follow to submit claims and receive remittance information. Our solutions ensure submission of appropriate documentation and claim submission in accordance with payer contracts and automate workstreams that help our clients avoid denials and rejections, monitor in- process claims, and process payer remittances. In addition, we offer claim scrubbing capabilities to check for errors and verify accuracy to limit billing mistakes. Built upon over two decades of industry experience, we believe that our AI-enabled rules engine drives an industry-leading first pass clean claims rate across both commercial and government (Medicare & Medicaid) claims.

12

Table of Contents
We sell our platform through our sales team comprised of over 100 representatives. Our sales teams are dedicated to either ambulatory providers or hospital and health system clients given the specific needs, call points, and sales cycles of those client types. Our sales approach to ambulatory provider clients consists of high velocity direct enterprise go-to market strategy, with a shorter sales cycle, whereas our direct enterprise go-to-market strategy for hospital and health systems clients typically has a longer sales cycle. The team is further specialized, with certain individuals focused on winning new clients and others focused on cross- selling into existing clients. We leverage data and analytics to manage the effectiveness of our sales force, as well as identify areas for potential improvement. Our client-centric sales model is fueled by frequent engagement with our clients. We have assigned dedicated client success managers to clients that have generated almost half our revenue since the beginning of 2021.
In addition to our direct sales force, we have a team focused on strengthening and expanding our channel partner and alliance relationships. We have established strong partnerships with the nation’s leading EHR and PM providers for integration and joint go-to-market efforts to providers. In addition, our strategic partners extend our sales presence and accelerate direct sales of our solutions by actively referring and promoting us to their client bases, enabling incremental touchpoints for our sales team who is ultimately responsible for marketing and selling to the client. We also partner with and sell to outsourced revenue cycle or billing service providers, who leverage our technology to help providers manage their administrative processes and payments.
Our go-to-market representatives are supported by a commercial operations team that is focused on developing strategic plans and driving team member development to enhance our effectiveness. Our go-to- market team also works with our product subject-matter experts, who help identify prospective client pain points and business challenges and help configure optimal solutions. Additionally, we have built a high- performance marketing function that has significantly elevated Waystar’s voice in the industry, expanding awareness of our brand over time.
Our Business Model
Over 99% of our revenue is either recurring subscription or based on highly predictable volumes. Our contracts with clients generally include a subscription fee component as well as a volume-based component, although some contracts include only one of these components. The subscription fee provides us with a fixed, recurring revenue stream while the volume-based component allows us to benefit from our clients’ growth. We generate greater revenue as our clients see more patients and greater utilization of their healthcare services. In addition, based on our contract structures, our proprietary data asset, our predictive analytics capabilities, and our deep understanding of the healthcare market, we believe we have visibility into and an ability to predict both subscription-based and volume-based revenue. For instance, 98% of revenue in 2024 was generated from clients already under contract as of the beginning of the year. Our client contracts are typically two or three years in length with automatic renewals for successive one-year terms that include standard price escalators. Client billing generally occurs monthly.
Our Clients
Our clients represent healthcare providers across all types of care settings, including physician practices, clinics, surgical centers, and laboratories, as well as large hospitals and health systems. Generally, 30% of our revenue comes from hospitals and health systems, while 70% comes from ambulatory and alternate sites of care. The over 30,000 clients we currently serve also vary significantly in size and represent over one million distinct providers in total, including 16 of the top 20 U.S. News Best Hospitals. As a result of our broadly applicable model, our client base is highly diversified, and for the year ended December 31, 2024, our top 10 clients accounted for only 11.2% of our total revenue. The number of clients from whom we generate over $100,000 of revenue has grown from 982 in the year ended December 31, 2022 to 1,203 in the year ended December 31, 2024, driven by large, new client wins and successful cross-selling and up-selling efforts.
Our clients have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our platform solutions after the initial term expires, which is typically a two to three-year term. Our contracts generally provide for the automatic renewal for one-year subsequent terms, with the ability for our clients to terminate the contract with limited notice to us. However, we believe that due to the breadth, depth, and quality of our products, as well as the significant time and resources it takes to switch to a different healthcare payments provider, we will be able to retain our existing clients and upsell and cross-sell to them, as evidenced by our Net Revenue Retention Rate of 110.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024.

We also provide our team members with paid leave for volunteer time, as we believe it is important for Waystar and its team members to give back to the community. We regularly celebrate individuals and team members who exemplify Waystar’s values. We believe this helps us reinforce our values and creates a performance-focused culture that enables us to continue to attract, retain, and develop talent, which is critical to our long-term success.
Training, Development, Leadership, and Engagement
To engage and incentivize our workforce, we provide a wide range of training and development opportunities to support and motivate our team members to operate at their best and succeed. These opportunities include, but are not limited to, Front Line Leadership training for people leaders, Emerging Leader Training for potential leaders, and an annual Leadership Summit for our top leaders. All team members participate in annual training that reinforces our values, certifies team members on key business processes, and helps to promote a workplace of respect, safety, and engagement.
The continued engagement of our talented and committed team is critical to our business. Each year, we gauge our team members’ level of engagement and satisfaction by conducting an employee engagement survey with the assistance of a third-party. As a part of this process, we solicit feedback from team members on training and development opportunities, benefits, well-being, and our ethical culture. We also ask for feedback about their people leader’s effectiveness and ability to foster a more inclusive and diverse workplace.

Inclusion and Diversity
At Waystar, we aspire to create an environment where every team member, with their unique background, feels a sense of belonging. We believe that we rise by lifting others up and provide a safe, inclusive work environment where every team member can be their whole, authentic self-no matter their age, race, sexual orientation, gender, or unique background. We have an Inclusion & Diversity Council that oversees various events and initiatives, including various mentorship programs that provide underrepresented students with salaried internships. We also have a “Waystar Day” every quarter that focuses on different initiatives such as kindness, diversity and inclusion, and volunteering, as well as education assistance opportunities in furtherance of self-advancement and development. In addition, we have five Affinity Groups (BIPOC, Families, LGBTQIA+, Military, and Women) which seek to foster a sense of shared community and empowerment for employees who share a common social identity, such as gender, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Team members can voluntarily join an Affinity Group to network, discuss and exchange ideas, and enhance their professional development.
Research and Development
We believe that our research and development function and our cloud-based product portfolio provides us with a competitive advantage that enables us to innovate faster and more efficiently, while simultaneously delivering better solutions for our clients. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our products and software. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately more than 280 team members dedicated to product and research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 our research and development expense was $48.8 million, $35.3 million, and $32.8 million, respectively.
Competition
We operate in a highly fragmented and competitive market that is characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, evolving regulatory requirements, and frequent changes in client needs and introduction of new products and solutions. However, we believe we have a competitive advantage based on the breadth, depth, and quality of our solutions, our innovative cloud-based software platform, our deep domain expertise developed over two decades of industry experience, the differentiated client service we provide, and the ROI we deliver.
Our current principal competitors include, but are not limited to:
●
Revenue cycle technology vendors
: vendors varying in scale that specialize in revenue cycle management. These vendors frequently utilize legacy technology, have a limited breadth of solutions or typically focus on providers in specific settings of care, such as hospitals or ambulatory practices.
●
Point solution vendors
: vendors that specialize or focus on point solutions for a specific healthcare payment workflow without addressing the entire healthcare payments workflow from pre-encounter to post-encounter. In addition, certain vendors focus exclusively on patient payments.
●
EHR and PM systems providers
: certain EHR and PM systems, including certain of our strategic partners and those with which we integrate, offer, or may begin to offer, solutions such as claim management and patient management solutions, payment processing tools, and direct patient communication solutions.
●
Internally developed software or manual processes
: large healthcare providers may have sufficient IT resources to develop and maintain proprietary internal systems, or to consider developing new custom systems. Many healthcare providers may also rely on manual tasks and labor, without the use of technology enabled systems.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
●
breadth, depth, and quality of products and solutions;
●
ability to deliver financial and operational performance improvement through the use of products and solutions;
●
quality and reliability of solutions;
15

Table of Contents
●
ease of use and convenience;
●
brand recognition;
●
price; and
●
the ability to integrate our platform solutions with various EHR and PM systems and other technology.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. However, we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on the continued success of our disciplined investments in research and development and sales and marketing programs. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and our Industry—We operate in a highly competitive industry.”
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, trade secret, copyright, and other intellectual property laws, as well as contractual provisions, including in employment, confidentiality, and inventions assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property, intangible assets, and associated proprietary rights. Our intellectual property, particularly our know-how is material to the conduct of our business. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to use our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property in the operation of our business and platform. In the United States, we have 19 trademark registrations, 15 issued patents, and 26 copyright registrations. In addition, we have registered the www.waystar.com domain name, which we use in connection with our platform.
We have procedures in place to monitor for potential infringement of our intellectual property, and it is our policy to take appropriate action to enforce our intellectual property, taking into account the strength of our claim, likelihood of success, cost, and overall business priorities. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology Systems, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Intellectual Property.”
Security and Compliance
Security and compliance are our top priorities. We maintain a comprehensive security program designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our clients’ data. In particular, we deploy physical, administrative, and technical controls to protect the security and privacy of patient information.
We operate a cloud-based platform that offers reliability, performance, security, and privacy for our clients. We have infrastructure in place with co-located data centers, and within Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service, and Google Cloud Platform environments, to securely manage and maintain our clients’ patient information.
We use external security auditors and industry-leading vendors, such as CrowdStrike and CYE to ensure we have the controls and procedures in place to protect our clients’ sensitive information. We have industry certifications, including HITRUST, PCI-DSS Level 1 Service Provider, SSAE 18 SOC 2, and validated PCI Point-to-Point Encryption. As a PCI-DSS Level 1 Service Provider, we are committed to upholding industry security standards to cardholder data. We received our HITRUST CSF certification in 2021.
We are committed to protecting the information and privacy of our clients and their patients. We are both a “covered entity” when we provide our clearinghouse services and a “business associate” as defined under HIPAA or subcontractor to a business associate to healthcare providers or revenue cycle management companies. We sign business associate agreements (“BAA”) that govern our uses and disclosures of protected health information (“PHI”) to our own business associates and on behalf of our covered entity clients that engage us to provide our software solutions. Such BAAs must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances as to how we will use and disclose PHI; that we will implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such PHI from misuse; that we will enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information; that we will report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of PHI; and that we will assist the client with certain of its duties under HIPAA.

Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive, complex, and rapidly changing federal and state laws, regulations, and industry standards. These laws and regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations by governmental and regulatory authorities may change periodically. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or governmental or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
Federal and State Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information, including individually identifiable health information. In particular, HIPAA established privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI, and required the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individually identifiable health information in both paper and electronic form. HIPAA also required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to adopt national standards establishing electronic transaction standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. For example, claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to payors must comply with specific formatting standards, and these standards apply whether the payor is a government or a private entity. We are contractually required to structure and provide our solutions in a way that supports our clients’ HIPAA compliance obligations to use prescribed electronic formats.
HIPAA requires us to enter into written agreements with covered entities, business associates, and subcontractors with respect to uses and disclosures of PHI. Covered entities, such as us and our clients, may be subject to penalties for, among other activities, failing to enter into a BAA where required by law or as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity and acting within the scope of the agency. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under HIPAA. In instances where we act as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond our status as a covered entity. Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil and criminal penalties, as well as monitoring or resolution agreements. A single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards.
We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule and equivalent state breach notification laws. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which compromises the privacy or security of the PHI, but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Many state laws and regulations require affected individuals to be notified in the event of a data breach involving PHI within a shorter timeframe. Under HIPAA, all impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless an exception to the definition of breach applies or the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised based on a risk assessment of at least four regulatory factors. In addition, notification must be provided to HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects 500 or more individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit, or otherwise) alleging non-compliance with HIPAA in our maintenance of PHI. Violations of HIPAA by providers like us, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties.
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, the HITECH Act mandated that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine paid by the violator.
In the past year, HHS has also issued new final and proposed regulations and guidance on cybersecurity of electronic PHI (“ePHI”) uses and disclosures of substance use information, reproductive health information, and online tracking technologies that access individually identifiable health information. For example, in April 2024, a new HHS final rule amending substance use confidentiality regulations (42 C.F.R. Part 2 or Part 2) took effect. The final rule included changes to better facilitate care coordination, updates to the fine structure for Part 2 violations to align with the civil and criminal enforcement authorities that apply to HIPAA violations, and increases in penalties for Part 2 violations to a $50,000 maximum penalty for failure to comply with the Part 2 requirements and a $250,000 maximum penalty for the wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information.

Table of Contents
In December 2024, HHS Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to better protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. The proposed rule would, among other requirements, remove the distinction between “required” and “addressable” implementation specifications and make all implementation specifications required with specific, limited exceptions; require written documentation of all HIPAA Security Rule policies, procedures, plans, and analyses; require regulated entities to conduct compliance audits at least once every twelve months to ensure their compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule requirements; require encryption of ePHI at rest and in transit; require the use of multi-factor authentication, with limited exceptions; and require network segmentation and separate technical controls. The proposed rule remains subject to public comment until March 2025.
In April 2024, HHS OCR issued a final rule that amended HIPAA privacy regulations to prohibit the disclosure of PHI related to lawful reproductive health care in certain circumstances. The final rule prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI when PHI is sought for certain investigations or to impose liability on individuals, health care providers, or others who seek, obtain, provide, or facilitate reproductive health care that is lawful under the circumstances in which such health care is provided. It also requires a health care provider, health plan, clearinghouse, or their business associates, to obtain a signed attestation that certain requests for PHI potentially related to reproductive health care are not made for these prohibited purposes. The final rule took effect on June 25, 2024.
Additionally, in a 2023 guidance document, HHS OCR took the position that entities regulated under HIPAA are not permitted to use tracking technologies in a manner that would result in an impermissible disclosure of PHI. Such tracking technologies have been used to collect and analyze information about user behavior and enhance the user experience. In March 2024, HHS OCR updated its 2023 guidance on the use of online tracking technologies on webpages and applications by HIPAA covered entities and business associates to address the disclosure of individually identifiable health information through unauthenticated, public-facing webpages. There have been several class action lawsuits asserting that HIPAA covered entities and business associates improperly used or disclosed PHI through tracking technologies.
Other Data Privacy Laws, Regulations, and Industry Standards
In addition, because our business and platform involve the Processing of personal information and other confidential and regulated information, we are also subject to numerous additional laws, regulations, and industry standards. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was subsequently amended by the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), originally took effect in 2020, and provides California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for certain violations. Many additional jurisdictions around the world, including many additional U.S. states, have adopted or are proposing to adopt laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, and we may become subject to additional requirements and obligations as we expand the scope of our business and operations. Further, we are also subject to industry standards such as PCI-DSS as a result of the credit card payments initiated by patients and provider staff members. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to compliance with data privacy laws and regulations, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology Systems, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Intellectual Property.”
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Provisions
A number of federal and state laws, generally referred to as fraud and abuse laws, apply to healthcare providers, physicians and others that make, offer, seek or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state healthcare program and in some instances any private program. Given the breadth of these laws and regulations, they may affect our business, either directly or because they apply to our clients.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “AKS”) is broadly worded and prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce (1) the referral of an individual covered by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, or (2) the purchasing, leasing, or ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program. Court decisions have held that the AKS can be violated even if only “one purpose” of remuneration is to induce or reward referrals or other business generated between the parties. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the AKS include imprisonment for up to ten years, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, potential liability under the federal civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq. (the “FCA”) (as discussed below), and significant civil and criminal fines and monetary penalties, plus a civil assessment of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the AKS are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years in the case of criminal conviction.

Table of Contents
In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the HHS, Office of Inspector General has promulgated safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed not to be in violation of the AKS, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that particular arrangement violates the AKS, but instead will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. Arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
Under HIPAA, there are additional provisions regarding healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters, which if not complied with, could have an impact on our business. The healthcare fraud provision prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud provision or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The false statements provision prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Violations of these provisions are felonies and may result in fines or imprisonment, or, in the case of the healthcare fraud provision, exclusion from government programs.
Additionally, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
●
presenting, or causing to be presented, claims, reports, or records relating to payment by Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed, is false or fraudulent, or was presented for a physician’s service by a person who knows or should know that the individual providing the service is not a licensed physician, obtained licensure through misrepresentation or represented certification in a medical specialty without in fact possessing such certification;
●
offering remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular provider;
●
arranging contracts with or making payments to an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal healthcare programs or included on CMS’ preclusion list;
●
violating the AKS;
●
making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal healthcare program;
●
making, using, or causing to be made any false statement, omission, or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid, or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal healthcare program; and
●
failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government.
Violations of applicable fraud and abuse laws could result in substantial civil monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, should an individual providing services under our client contracts become excluded, we may be in violation of our agreements with clients and required to refund amounts attributable to services performed or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual.

False and Fraudulent Claims Laws
There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid (i) submitting a false claim, (ii) causing the submission of a false claim, (iii) retaining a known overpayment, or (iv) engaging in similar types of conduct. The FCA, among other things, prohibits an individual or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government, including but not limited to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and related managed care programs. Many states have their own false claims laws prohibiting similar conduct to the extent the claim seeks payment from state funds, including Medicaid, and states are becoming increasingly active in using such laws to police false bills, false requests for payment, and other activities. The standard for “knowledge” under the FCA includes “reckless disregard” or “deliberate ignorance” of the truth or falsity of the information. There are a number of other potential bases for liability under the FCA, including knowingly and improperly avoiding an obligation to repay money to the government (often called the “reverse false claims” provision). The government has used the FCA to bring civil claims for Medicare and other government program fraud based on allegations including but not limited to those involving coding issues (including up-coding), the submission of false cost or other reports, and billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate. Violations of other laws, such as the AKS and the Stark Law, can serve as a basis for liability under the FCA.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, provides that claims for payment that are tainted by a violation of the AKS (which could include, for example, illegal incentives, or remuneration) are false for purposes of the FCA. In addition, amendments to the FCA and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments from government payors. The FCA may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a private qui tam plaintiff (a “relator”) on the government’s behalf. In the latter circumstance, the government is required to investigate the allegations brought by the relator, and then must decide whether or not to intervene. Even if the government declines to intervene, the relator may continue to proceed with the lawsuit on the government’s behalf. When a relator brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant often will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination whether or not it will intervene.
If a defendant is found liable under the FCA, the defendant is subject to penalties for each separate false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. These penalties are adjusted annually. A successful qui tam relator is entitled to receive a share of any settlement of judgment. In addition to civil enforcement under the FCA, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. It is difficult to predict how future enforcement initiatives may impact our business.
Stark Law and Similar State Laws
The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and healthcare entities and thus potentially applies to our clients. The law prohibits a physician who has (or whose immediate family member has) a financial relationship with a provider from making referrals to that entity for “designated health services” if payment for the services may be made under Medicare or Medicaid. If such a financial relationship exists, referrals are prohibited unless a statutory or regulatory exception is available. Further, an entity that furnishes designated health services pursuant to a prohibited referral may not present or cause to be presented a claim or bill for such services to the Medicare program or to any other individual or entity. Violations of the Stark Law can result in civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs and form the basis for liability under the FCA. Laws in many states similarly forbid billing based on referrals between individuals and entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships. Any such violations by, and penalties and exclusions imposed upon, our clients could adversely affect their financial condition and, in turn, could adversely affect our own financial condition.

State Fraud and Abuse Laws
Many states, including certain states in which we conduct our business, have adopted fraud and abuse laws similar to the federal laws described above. These laws are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion, and the scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items and services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers. For example, several states have anti-kickback and self-referral prohibitions, which may apply regardless of whether the payor for such claims is Medicare or Medicaid and which may affect our ability to enter into financial relationships with certain entities or individuals. A determination of liability under state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines, penalties, and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions, administrative sanctions, exclusions from governmental healthcare programs, refund requirements, and disciplinary action by the applicable governmental authority, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.
Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee Splitting
We enter into contracts with healthcare providers pursuant to which we provide them with software solutions, and may be subject to regulatory oversight, including corporate practice of medicine and fee- splitting prohibitions. Some states have enacted laws and regulations prohibiting business corporations from practicing medicine and limiting the extent to which physicians and certain other healthcare professionals may be employed by non-physicians or business corporations. These laws are intended to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing or splitting professional services income or fees with lay entities or persons. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. The scope and enforcement of such corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws varies from state to state. Violations of these laws could require us to restructure our operations and arrangements and may result in penalties or other adverse action.
Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our agreements with healthcare providers licensed in the state. Governmental or regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with healthcare providers constitute unlawful fee splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our healthcare provider clients, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, the need to make changes to our contracts, and other materially adverse consequences.
Government Regulation of Reimbursement
Our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, our clients are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates. Our clients may also be impacted by recent or future federal government cost-cutting and efficiency measures and any actual or potential reduction in the federal workforce that administers federal healthcare programs. During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other healthcare providers. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases or changes in reimbursement or that there will be substantial changes to federal healthcare programs or other government programs or spending that adversely affect our clients, or our cost of providing our solutions. Any such changes could adversely affect our own financial condition by reducing the reimbursement rates of our clients or otherwise materially impacting our clients.
Consumer Protection Laws
We may also be subject to both federal and state regulatory agencies who have the authority to investigate consumer complaints relating to a variety of consumer protection laws, including but not limited to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (the “FDCPA”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non- Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the “CAN-SPAM Act”), and any state equivalent(s) of the foregoing. Our business practices involve assisting clients in collecting non-defaulted amounts owed by patients for current and prior services activities, which may subject us to the FDCPA. The FDCPA restricts the methods we may use to contact and seek payment from patients regarding past due accounts. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection practices, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. Moreover, regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. Such laws and regulations, if deemed to apply to us, are continually evolving and any enforcement actions under such laws could result in fines, penalties, litigation, and increased expenses associated with compliance.

Indemnification and Insurance
Our business exposes us to potential liability including, but not limited to, potential liability for breach of contract or negligence claims by our clients, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, we may also be liable for the acts or omissions of others, such as our vendors or suppliers. On occasion, we enter into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual. Maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future but have not yet been made. We have not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements.
We attempt to manage our potential liability to third-parties through contractual protection (such as indemnification and limitation of liability provisions) in our contracts with clients and others, and through insurance. The contractual indemnification provisions vary in scope and may not protect us against all potential liabilities, such as liability arising out of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, in the event that we seek to enforce such an indemnification provision, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient resources to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or may otherwise not comply with its contractual obligations.
We may require our clients and other counterparties to maintain adequate insurance, and we currently maintain errors, omissions, and professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe to be appropriate. The coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims made and such claims may be contested by applicable insurance carriers.
