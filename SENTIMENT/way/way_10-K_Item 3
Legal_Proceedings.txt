Legal Proceedings
We are subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including claims resulting from employment related matters. We believe that we are not party to any material pending legal proceedings and we are not aware of any claims that could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “WAY.” As of February 12, 2025, there were approximately 21 shareholders of record. This does not include persons whose stock is held in nominee or “street name” accounts through brokers.
Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we granted an aggregate of 4,003,703 stock options which were not registered under the Securities Act to employees, directors, and consultants under our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, with per share exercise prices ranging from $21.50 to $37.20. In addition, we issued 2,420 shares of common stock that were not registered under the Securities Act to employees, directors, or consultants under our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan upon the exercise of vested stock options with per share exercise prices ranging from $16.53 to $36.37.
None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. The sales of the above securities were deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act (or Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated thereunder) or Rule 701 promulgated under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering or pursuant to benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation as provided under Rule 701. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in these transactions.
Purchases of Equity Securities by Issuer
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities that are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Dividend Policy
We currently expect to retain all future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock. The declaration, amount, and payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and will depend on, among other things, general and economic conditions, our results of operations and financial condition, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, including restrictions under our credit agreements and other indebtedness we may incur, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. If we elect to pay such dividends in the future, we may reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of Waystar Holding Corp. (“Waystar”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors outside the Company’s control, as well as assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described under the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” above and 
Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” 
in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.
Overview
Waystar provides healthcare organizations with mission-critical cloud software that simplifies healthcare payments. Our enterprise-grade platform streamlines the complex and disparate processes our healthcare provider clients must manage to be reimbursed correctly, while improving the payments experience for providers, patients, and payers. We leverage AI as well as proprietary, advanced algorithms to automate payment-related workflow tasks and drive continuous improvement, which enhances claim and billing accuracy, enriches data integrity, and reduces labor costs for providers.
Our software is used daily by providers of all types and sizes across the continuum of care, including physician practices, clinics, surgical centers, and laboratories, as well as large hospitals and health systems. We currently serve over 30,000 clients of various sizes, representing over one million distinct providers practicing across a variety of care sites, including 16 of the top 20 institutions on the U.S. News Best Hospitals Honor Roll. Our business model is designed such that as our clients grow to serve more patients, their claims and transactional volumes increase, resulting in corresponding growth in our business. In addition, our clients frequently adopt a greater number of our solutions over time and introduce our solutions across new sites of care. In 2024, we facilitated over six billion healthcare payments transactions, including over $1.8 trillion in gross claims volume. As of 2023, we facilitated healthcare payments transactions spanning approximately 50% of patients in the United States.
Our platform benefits from powerful network effects. Our cloud-based software is driven by a sophisticated, automated, and curated rules engine, employing AI to generate and incorporate real-time feedback from millions of network transactions processed through our platform each day. Every transaction we process provides additional data insights across providers, patients, and payers, which are embedded in updates that are deployed efficiently across our client base. This results in cumulative benefits to us over time —as we capture more data from each transaction we process, we leverage that data to continue to improve the Waystar platform through embedded machine learning, advanced algorithms, and other in-house AI technologies to deliver added value to our clients. In turn, the more value we create for our clients, the more likely it is that they will continue to use our products, allowing us to continue to capture more data that results in tangible improvements to our platform. As a result, our clients benefit from faster and more efficient performance from software that is evolving to meet ever-changing regulatory and payer requirements, enabling accurate and timely reimbursement.
We have demonstrated an ability to drive recurring, predictable, and profitable growth. Over 99% of our revenue is either recurring subscription or based on highly predictable volumes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, our Net Revenue Retention Rate was 110.1% and we have 1,203 clients as of December 31, 2024 generating over $100,000 over the same twelve-month period. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated revenue of $943.5 million (reflecting a 19.3% increase compared to revenue of $791.0 million for the same period in the prior year), net loss of $19.1 million (compared to net loss of $51.3 million for the same period in the prior year), and Adjusted EBITDA of $383.5 million (reflecting a 14.9% increase compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $333.7 million for the same period in the prior year).
Initial Public Offering
In June 2024, we completed an IPO of 45,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $21.50 per share. After underwriting discounts and commissions of $53.2 million, we received total proceeds from the offering of $914.3 million. On July 5, 2024, pursuant to the option granted to the underwriters for a period of 30 days from the date of the prospectus to purchase up to 6,750,000 additional shares of common stock from us at the IPO price less the underwriting discount, the underwriters exercised the right to purchase 5,059,010 additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $102.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.0 million. The remaining option to purchase additional shares expired unexercised at the end of the 30-day period. See Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements—Note 1 (Business)”, for more information.

Significant Items Affecting Comparability
We believe that the future growth and profitability of our business, and the comparability of our results from period to period, depend on numerous factors, including the following:
Our Ability to Expand our Relationship with Existing Clients
As our clients grow their businesses and provide more services and see more patients, our volume-based revenues also increase. In addition, our growth in revenues also depends on our ability to sell more products and solutions to existing clients, including through cross-selling as our clients adopt additional Waystar offerings as well as up-selling as our clients leverage our solutions across additional providers and sites of care.
Our Ability to Grow our Client Base
We are focused on continuing to grow our client base, which will depend in part on our ability to continue to maintain our product leadership, invest in our research and development team, and maintain our reputation and brand.
Timing and Number of Acquisitions
Since 2018, we have completed and successfully integrated nine acquisitions, two of which closed in the second half of 2023; HealthPay24 on August 3, 2023; and certain assets of Olive AI, Inc.’s Clearinghouse and Patient Access business on October 31, 2023. The historical results of operations of our acquisitions are only included starting from the date of closing of such acquisition. As a result, our consolidated statements of operations for any given period during which an acquisition closed may not be comparable to future periods, which would include the results of operations of such acquisition for the entirety of such future period.
Impacts of Our Competitor’s Cybersecurity Attack
Following the February 2024 cybersecurity incident involving one of our competitors, more than 30,000 providers, including a significant number of large health systems and ambulatory providers, began adopting our solutions, and we were able to implement our solutions for many of these new clients in as little as 48 hours. This incident and our response to it generated approximately $34 million in additional revenue in the year ended December 31, 2024 due to increased win rates above our historically competitive rates and associated accelerated implementation timeline.
Impacts of the IPO
●
Debt Repayment
. In connection with the closing of the IPO, we repaid $909.1 million outstanding principal amount and $2.8 million accrued interest on our First Lien Credit Facility and incurred debt extinguishment costs of $9.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. On July 12, 2024, we utilized the additional proceeds from the underwriters’ exercise of the overallotment option, as well as cash on hand, to repay $110.9 million outstanding principal and $0.4 million accrued interest on our First Lien Credit Facility. The debt repayments will result in lower interest expense moving forward, partially offset by losses on extinguishment of debt in the period the debt repayment is made.
●
Stock-Based Compensation Expenses. 
We expect to recognize stock-based compensation expense of $17.9 million per year over the applicable vesting periods in connection with equity awards granted in connection with the IPO. 
Such
 stock-based compensation expense will be reflected in our results of operations from the closing date of the IPO through the applicable vesting periods of such awards. Additionally, we recognized $33.1 million of stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 as the vesting of our performance condition options became probable upon the closing of the IPO as the implicit service period for the awards established at the grant date had elapsed.
●
Incremental Public Company Expenses. 
Following the IPO, we have begun to incur significant expenses on an ongoing 
basis
 that we did not incur as a private company. Those costs include additional director and officer liability insurance expenses, as well as third-party and internal resources related to accounting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, legal, and investor and public relation expenses. These costs will generally be expensed under general and administrative expenses.

Table of Contents
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We primarily generate two types of revenue: (i) subscription revenue and (ii) volume-based revenue, which account for 99% of total revenue for all periods presented. We believe we have high visibility into our volume-based and subscription revenue from existing clients. We refer to the solutions our clients use to better process and understand their payment workflows from payers as provider solutions, and we refer to the products that assist healthcare providers in collecting payments from patients as patient payment solutions. We expect provider solutions will continue to generate the substantial majority of our total revenue, although the revenue mix attributable to patient payment solutions is expected to increase slightly over time.
●
Subscription revenue
. Reflects recurring monthly provider count fees and minimum amounts owed. The vast majority of subscription revenue is generated by provider solutions, which constitute approximately 70% of total revenue for the periods presented.
●
Volume-based revenue
. Represents recurring fees associated with transaction count or dollar volumes in excess of minimums. Generally, approximately half of our volume-based revenue is generated from provider solutions that are based on transaction count, with the other half from patient payments solutions that are based on either dollar volumes or transaction count.
We also derive revenue from implementation fees for our software, as well as hardware sales to facilitate patient payments. Our implementation fees are billed upfront, and the revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term.
Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)
Cost of revenue includes salaries, stock-based compensation, and benefits (“personnel costs”) for our team members who are focused on implementation, support, and other client-focused operations, as well as team members focused on enhancing and developing our platform. Cost of revenue also includes costs for third-party technology such as interchange fees and infrastructure related to the operations of our platform, including communicating and processing patient payments, and services to support the delivery of our solutions. Third-party costs for patient payments solutions are approximately 60% of the revenue generated from these solutions, while third-party costs for provider solutions are approximately 6% to 8% of the associated revenue, in each case, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing costs consist primarily of personnel costs, internal sales commissions, channel partner fees, travel, and advertising costs.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs incurred in our corporate service functions such as finance expenses, legal, human resources, and information technology, as well as other professional service costs.
Research and Development
Research and development (“R&D”) costs consist primarily of personnel costs for team members engaged in research and development activities as well as third-party fees. All such costs are expensed as incurred, except for capitalized software development costs.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of certain intangible assets, including capitalized software.
61

Table of Contents
Other Expense
Other expense consists primarily of interest expense and related-party interest expense, inclusive of the impact of interest rate swaps.
Income Tax Benefit
Income tax benefit includes current income tax and income tax credits from deferred taxes. Income tax benefit is recognized in profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the income tax expense is also recognized in equity or other comprehensive income.

Additionally, there was an increase in third party fees of $14.1 million expensed as incurred, of which $10.3 million related to the debt modification related to the refinancing of the First Lien Credit Facility in February, $2.4 million related to the debt re-pricing in June, $1.3 million related to the debt re-pricing in December and $0.1 million relates to the payoff of the Second Lien Credit Facility in February.
General and administrative expense was $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $10.2 million, or 13.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by an impairment expense recognized in 2022 related to leasehold improvements and right-of-use assets at closed office locations of $10.9 million.
Research and Development
Research and development expense was $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $13.4 million, or 38.0%. The increase was driven by higher personnel costs, net of capitalized expenses, of $7.3 million increase and increased third party consulting and engineering efforts. Additionally, there was increased stock-based compensation expense of $7.0 million primarily related to the recognition of performance condition options and new option and RSU grants related to the June IPO.

Table of Contents
Research and development expense was $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $32.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $2.5 million, or 7.7%. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, net of capitalized expenses, of $1.5 million and increased third party consulting and engineering efforts, net of capitalized amounts, of $0.4 million.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $186.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $10.2 million, or 5.8%. Due to the relocation of one of our offices, we reduced the useful life of the related finance lease and leasehold improvement assets which represented $17.9 million of accelerated depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2024. This was offset by several intangibles fully matured in 2024, driving a decrease in intangible amortization.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $183.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $6.7 million, or 3.7%. The decrease was primarily driven by $6.3 million of amortization in 2022 related to intangible assets that were fully amortized as of January 1, 2023.
Other Expense
Total interest expense was $146.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $205.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $59.6 million, or 29.0%. The decrease was driven by the First Lien Credit Facility paydown during 2024 totaling $1.0 billion and the full paydown of the Second Lien Credit Facility.
Total interest expense was $205.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $50.6 million, or 32.6%, of which $48.6 million was primarily related to higher interest expense driven by higher interest rates with respect to our First Lien Credit Facility and Second Lien Credit Facility, which is net of the impact of interest rate swaps.
Income Tax Expense/ (Benefit)
Income tax benefit was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to an income tax benefit of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $9.1 million. The decrease was primarily driven by our net loss has decreased year over year, which is driven by a decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Income tax benefit was $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 13.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by decrease in pre-tax loss.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss), and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide.

Table of Contents
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income / (loss), and non-GAAP net income / (loss) per share are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or net income (loss) margin as measures of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, and debt service requirements. The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. A reconciliation is provided below for our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, net, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, and as further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, asset and lease impairments, costs related to amended debt agreements, and IPO related costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

Non-GAAP Net Income / (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income / (Loss) Per Share
We define non-GAAP net income as GAAP net income excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration costs, asset and lease impairments, IPO related costs, costs related to amended debt agreements and amortization of intangibles. We updated the definition of non-GAAP net income to include amortization of intangibles to align with a more common definition used by our peers. We have revised prior year disclosures to align with this updated definition. The tax effects of the adjustments are calculated using a management estimated annual effective non-GAAP tax rate of 21%.
Non-GAAP net income / (loss) per share is shown on both a basic and diluted basis and is defined as non-GAAP net income / (loss) divided by the basic or diluted weighted-average shares, respectively.

​
Our Net Revenue Retention Rate compares twelve months of client invoices for our solutions at two period end dates. To calculate our Net Revenue Retention Rate, we first accumulate the total amount invoiced during the twelve months ending with the prior period-end, or Prior Period Invoices. We then calculate the total amount invoiced to those same clients for the twelve months ending with the current period-end, or Current Period Invoices. Current Period Invoices are inclusive of upsell, downsell, pricing changes, clients that cancel or chose not to renew, and discontinued solutions with continuing clients. The Net Revenue Retention Rate is then calculated by dividing the Current Period Invoices by the Prior Period Invoices. Our total invoices included in the analysis are greater than 98% of reported revenue. We use Net Revenue Retention Rate to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Acquired businesses are included in the last-twelve month Net Revenue Retention Rate in the ninth quarter after acquisition, which is the earliest point that comparable post-acquisition invoices are available for both the current and prior twelve-month period.
Customer Count with >$100,000 Revenue
We also regularly monitor and review our count of clients who generate more than $100,000 of revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current and future needs. Our expected primary uses on a short-term and long-term basis are for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, and investments in future growth, including acquisitions. We have historically funded our operations and acquisitions through our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and debt financings. We believe that our existing unrestricted cash on hand, expected future cash flows from operations, and additional borrowings will provide sufficient resources to fund our operating requirements, as well as future capital expenditures, debt service requirements, and investments in future growth for at least the next 12 months. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings, or a combination of these potential sources of funds. In the event that we need access to additional cash, we may not be able to access the credit markets on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures and our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors beyond our control, including those described under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report.
On December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had restricted cash of $22.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively, which consists of cash deposited in lockbox accounts owned by us which are contractually required to be disbursed to participating clients on the following day, as well as cash collected on behalf of healthcare providers from patients that have not yet been remitted to providers. These funds payable are not available for our use and liquidity, and are offset on our balance sheet by an aggregated funds payable liability.
Our liquidity is influenced by many factors, including timing of revenue and corresponding cash collections, the amount and timing of investments in strategic initiatives, our investments in property, equipment, and software, as well as other factors described under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may not be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all.

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $169.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was largely driven by the changes in working capital, increases in revenue and profits, and decreases in the cash paid for interest due to the multiple paydowns on our First Lien Credit Facility in 2024.
67

Table of Contents
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $102.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the change in deferred income taxes and income tax receivable resulting in a decrease of $43.4 million and by an impairment expense of $10.9 million recognized in 2022 related to leasehold improvements and right-of-use assets at closed office locations.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
Cash flows used in investing activities were $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased due to the $40.0 million of cash used in the 2023 acquisitions of HealthPay24 and certain assets of Olive AI (see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements—Note 6”).
Cash flows used in investing activities were $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2023 relative to 2022 as we used $40.0 million for acquisitions completed in 2023.
Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities
Cash flows provided by financing activities were $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to cash flows used of $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to the proceeds from our IPO net of third-party IPO issuance costs (see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements—Note 1”), as well as the issuance of debt, net of creditor fees (see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements—Note 11). These increases were offset by increased payments on our debt compared to the prior period (see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements—Note 11”).
Cash flows used in financing activities were $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased in 2023 relative to 2022 primarily due to the $47.0 million partial pay down in principal of the Second Lien Credit Facility in April 2022.
Indebtedness
First Lien Credit Facilities
Our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Waystar Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), is the Borrower under a first lien credit agreement, dated as of October 22, 2019 (as amended from time to time, the “First Lien Credit Agreement”), that initially provided for an $825.0 million senior secured first lien term loans and commitments under a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million, with a sub-commitment for issuance of letters of credit of $25.0 million. The initial first lien term loans are scheduled to mature on October 22, 2026 and commitments under the revolving credit facility and the loans thereunder were initially scheduled to terminate and mature on October 22, 2024.
On December 1, 2019, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to add 2019 first lien incremental term loans in the amount of $100.0 million to be used for certain acquisitions consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of such amendment. The terms of such 2019 first lien incremental term loans were the same as the terms of the initial first lien term loans, including in respect of maturity, and were considered an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the initial first lien term loans outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement and were part of the initial first lien term loans.
On September 23, 2020, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to (i) add 2020 first lien incremental term loans in the amount of $620.0 million to be used for certain acquisitions consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of such amendment and (ii) add revolving credit commitments in the amount of $75.0 million to increase the revolving credit commitments available under the First Lien Credit Agreement to $200.0 million. Such 2020 first lien incremental term loans constituted a separate class of first lien term loans from the initial first lien term loans but were otherwise on the same as the terms of the initial first lien term loans (other than with respect to the “LIBOR-floor” applicable thereto).
On March 24, 2021, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to (i) reduce the “LIBOR-floor” applicable to the 2020 first lien incremental term loans and (ii) in connection therewith, combine the initial first lien term loans with the 2020 first lien incremental term loans which thereafter then constituted one class of first lien term loans.
68

Table of Contents
On August 24, 2021, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to add 2021 first lien incremental term loans in the amount of $247.0 million to be used for certain acquisitions consummated substantially simultaneously with the closing of such amendment. The terms of such 2021 first lien incremental term loans were the same as the terms of the initial first lien term loans outstanding at such time, including in respect of maturity, and were considered an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the initial first lien term loans outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement at such time and were part of the initial first lien term loans.
On June 1, 2023, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to replace all LIBOR-based interest rates applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility with a Term SOFR-based rate plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.11%.
On June 23, 2023, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to replace all LIBOR-based interest rates applicable to the first lien term loans with a Term SOFR-based rate plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.11%.
On October 6, 2023, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among others, (i) increase the revolving credit commitments under the First Lien Credit Agreement by $142.5 million to a total of $342.5 million, with a sub-commitment for issuance of letters of credit of $50.0 million, (ii) amend the applicable margin with respect thereto upon the consummation of a qualifying initial public offering, and (iii) extend the availability period of such revolving credit commitments and the maturity date of loans thereunder from October 22, 2024 to October 6, 2028; 
provided
 that if, prior to October 6, 2028, either (i) on the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the first lien term loans (or any loans refinancing such first lien term loans), more than $150.0 million of such first lien term loans (or any such loans refinancing such first lien term loans) are outstanding or (ii) on the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the second lien term loans under the Second Lien Credit Facility (or any loans refinancing such second lien term loans), any such second lien term loans (or any such loans refinancing such second lien term loans) are outstanding, the commitments under the revolving credit facility and the loans thereunder will terminate and mature on such date (the “Springing Maturity Condition”). The revolving credit commitments as increased by the amendment replaced the existing revolving credit commitments under the First Lien Credit Agreement.
On February 9, 2024, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among others, (i) increase the total First Lien Credit Facility term loan balance to $2.2 billion, $449.6 million of which was utilized to pay off the remaining principal and interest on the Second Lien Credit Facility, and (ii) extend the maturity date of the First Lien Credit Facility to October 22, 2029. As of February 9, 2024, the effective interest rate under the First Lien Credit Facility was 4.00% per annum above the SOFR rate.
On June 27, 2024, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among other things, reprice the outstanding balance bearing an interest rate of 2.75% per annum above the SOFR rate with a minimum base of 0.00%.
On December 30, 2024, the Borrower and certain lenders amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) fully refinance the Borrower’s $1,166,772,750 aggregate outstanding principal amount of term loans under the Existing
 Credit Agreement with replacement term loans bearing reduced interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the election of the Borrower, either (a) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) subject to a floor of 0.00%, plus an applicable rate of 2.25% (compared to the previous applicable rate of 2.75%) or (b) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) subject to a floor of 1.00%, plus an applicable rate of 1.25% (compared to the previous applicable rate of 1.75%), (ii) increase the maximum borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $342.5 million to $400.0 million and (iii) reduce the interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facility to (a) Adjusted Term SOFR, plus an initial applicable rate of 1.75% (compared to the previous applicable rate of 2.25%) with adjustments to an applicable rate between 1.75% and 2.50% and (b) the Alternate Base Rate, plus an initial applicable rate of 0.75% (compared to the previous applicable rate of 1.25%) with adjustments to an applicable rate between 0.75% and 1.50%. Such adjustments will depend on the achievement of certain leverage ratios specified in the First Lien Credit Agreement.
All obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior first lien priority basis by, subject to certain exceptions, the Borrower and each of the Borrower’s existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly owned restricted subsidiaries organized in the United States. Additionally, the obligations under First Lien Credit Agreement and such guarantees are secured on a first lien priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and excluded assets, by (i) the equity securities of the Borrower and of each subsidiary guarantor and (ii) security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all personal property and material owned real property by the Borrower and each subsidiary guarantor.

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement currently bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Borrower, either (i) (x) the Term SOFR rate for the applicable interest period, with a floor of 0.00%, plus (y) an applicable margin rate of, for the first lien term loans, between 3.75% and 3.50% and, for loans under the revolving credit facility, between 3.00% and 2.25%, in each case, depending on the applicable first lien leverage ratio or (ii) (x) an alternate base rate (“ABR”), with a floor of 1.00%, plus (y) an applicable margin rate of, for the first lien term loans, between 2.75% and 2.50% and, for loans under the revolving credit facility, between 2.00% and 1.25%, in each case, depending on the applicable first lien leverage ratio (with the ABR determined as the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (c) the Term SOFR rate plus 1.00%).
In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the first lien term loans and the revolving credit facility, the Borrower is required to pay a commitment fee, payable quarterly in arrears, of 0.375% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility, with step-down to 0.25% per annum, in each case, on such portion upon achievement of certain first lien leverage ratios. The Borrower must also pay customary letter of credit issuance and participation fees and other customary fees and expenses of the letter of credit issuers.
The Borrower is required to repay installments on the first lien term loans in quarterly principal amounts equal to approximately $2.9 million on the last business day of each March, June, September, and December of each year, with the balance payable on October 22, 2029. Additionally, the entire principal amount of revolving loans outstanding (if any) under the revolving credit facility are due and payable in full at maturity on October 6, 2028, subject to the Springing Maturity Condition, on which day the revolving credit commitments thereunder will terminate.
The Borrower is required, subject to certain exceptions, to pay outstanding amounts of the first lien term loan, (i) with 50% of excess cash flow, with step-downs upon achievement of certain first lien net leverage ratios, (ii) with 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries, subject to customary reinvestment right, and (iii) with 100% of the net cash proceeds of issuances of debt obligations of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries, other than permitted debt. Additionally, the Borrower may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the first lien term loan and the revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty. In addition, the Borrower may elect to permanently terminate or reduce all or a portion of the revolving credit commitments and the letter of credit sub-limit under the revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty.
The First Lien Credit Agreement also includes customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable).
As of December 31, 2024, we had $1,164 million of outstanding borrowings on the first lien term loan and $400 million of availability under the revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement, and outstanding letters of credit of $0 million under the First Lien Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants under the First Lien Credit Agreement.
Second Lien Credit Facilities
Our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Waystar Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”), is the Borrower under a second lien credit agreement, dated as of October 22, 2019 (as amended from time to time, the “Second Lien Credit Agreement”), that initially provided for a second lien term loan of $255.0 million. On September 23, 2020, we increased the second lien term loan by an incremental $190.0 million (“2020 Incremental Second Lien Term Loan”) to a total of $445.0 million. On August 24, 2021, we increased the second lien term loan by an incremental $70.0 million to a total of $515.0 million in conjunction with the acquisition of Patientco (“2021 Incremental Second Lien Term Loan”). We refer to the term loan facilities under the Second Lien Credit Agreement as the “Second Lien Credit Facility.” The Second Lien Credit Facility matures on October 21, 2027. On June 27, 2023, we amended the Second Lien Credit Agreement to replace all LIBOR-based interest rates applicable to the second lien term loans with a Term SOFR-based rate plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.11%. On February 9, 2024, we utilized proceeds from the amended First Lien Credit Facility to paydown the remaining principal and interest on the Second Lien Credit Facility.

Receivables Facility
On August 13, 2021, the Borrower, as servicer, and Waystar RC LLC, a wholly-owned “bankruptcy remote” special purpose vehicle, as “Receivables Borrower”, entered into a receivables financing agreement (the “Receivables Financing Agreement”), providing for an aggregate borrowing of up to $50 million. Loans under the Receivables Financing Agreement mature on August 13, 2024. Borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement accrue interest at a rate per annum of, at the option of the Receivables Borrower, either Term SOFR or base rate plus 2.00%. All amounts outstanding under the Receivables Financing Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the accounts receivables and unbilled revenue of the Receivables Borrower. On October 31, 2023, the Borrower and Receivables Borrower amended the Receivables Financing Agreement to increase the aggregate borrowing availability to up to $80 million and extend the maturity date to October 30, 2026. On September 6, 2024, we drew $10.0 million on the Receivables Facility and used the proceeds to paydown $10.0 million on the First Lien Credit Facility.
In connection with the Receivables Financing Agreement, eligible accounts receivable of certain of our subsidiaries are sold to the Receivables Borrower. The Receivables Borrower pledges the receivables as security for loans. The accounts receivable owned by the Receivables Borrower are separate and distinct from our other assets and are not available to our other creditors should we become insolvent.
The Receivables Financing Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and default provisions.
As of December 31, 2024, the Receivables Borrower had $80 million in outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Receivables Financing Agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Critical accounting policies are those that we consider to be the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of judgments by management. Judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation upon transfer of control of the software solutions to the client in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. Revenues are recognized net of any taxes collected from clients and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
We derive revenue primarily from providing access to our solutions for use in the healthcare industry and in doing so generate two types of revenue: (i) subscription revenue and (ii) volume-based revenue, which account for 99% of total revenue for all periods presented. We also derive revenue from implementation fees for our software, as well as hardware sales to facilitate patient payments.
Revenue from our subscription services as well as from our volume-based services represents a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e., a stand-ready obligation) to our software solutions in the form of a service. Our software products are made available to our clients via a cloud-based, hosted platform where our clients do not have the right or practical ability to take possession of the software. As each day of providing access to the software solutions is substantially the same and the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as services are provided, these services are viewed as a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services.
71

Table of Contents
Revenue from our subscription services is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the service is made available to the client. Volume-based services are priced based on transaction, dollar volume, or provider count in a given period. Given the nature of the promise is based on unknown quantities or outcomes of services to be performed over the contract term, the volume-based fee is determined to be variable consideration. The volume-based transaction fees are recognized each day using a time-elapsed output method based on the volume or transaction count at the time the clients’ transactions are processed.
Our other services are generally related to implementation activities across all solutions and hardware sales to facilitate patient payments. Implementation services are not considered performance obligations as they do not provide a distinct service to clients without the use of our software solutions. As such, implementation fees related to our solutions are billed upfront and recognized ratably over the contract term. Implementation fees and hardware sales represent less than 1% of total revenue for all periods presented.
Revenue recorded where we act in the capacity of a principal is reported on a gross basis equal to the full amount of consideration to which we expect in exchange for the good or service transferred. Revenue recorded where we act in the capacity of an agent is reported on a net basis, exclusive of any consideration provided to the principal party in the transaction.
The principal versus agent evaluation is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement and is dependent on whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the client or whether we are acting as an agent of a third party. This evaluation is performed separately for each performance obligation identified. For the majority of our contracts, we are considered the principal in the transaction with the client and recognize revenue gross of any related channel partner fees or costs. We have certain agency arrangements where third parties control the goods or services provided to a client and we recognize revenue net of any fees owed to these third parties.
Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill and long-lived assets comprise 88.7% of our total assets as of December 31, 2024. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair value of the net intangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1st or whenever there is an impairment indicator. Potential impairment indicators may include, but are not limited to, the results of our most recent annual or interim impairment testing, downward revisions to internal forecasts, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management and key personnel, changes in composition or carrying amount of net assets, and changes in share price.
ASC Topic 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), allows entities to first use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment by determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment supports that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is not required. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset does not exceed its carrying value, we will perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, in which we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component). Our single operating segment is also our single reporting unit as we do not have segment managers and there is no discrete information reviewed at a level lower than the consolidated entity level. All of our assets and liabilities are assigned to this single reporting unit.
For our annual goodwill impairment test during the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment. Our assessment of relevant events and circumstances was designed to indicate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The assessment considered whether or not we observed changes in market conditions within the industry and macroeconomy, changes in cost factors which could result in a negative effect on earnings or financial performance of the reporting unit, such as negative or declining cash flows compared to prior period results, and other entity-specific events or conditions impacting the reporting unit. There were no indicators that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the asset did not exceed its carrying value. In connection with our goodwill impairment testing performed as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we concluded that there was no impairment to goodwill.
72

Table of Contents
Prior assessments have indicated that the fair value exceeds the carrying value for the reporting unit with reasonable headroom and no indication of impairment. However, we elect to perform a goodwill impairment test utilizing a quantitative approach every fourth year in order to calculate a new fair value “base” to which future qualitative tests can be compared. Our most recent quantitative assessment was performed as of October 1, 2024. We utilized both an income approach and market approach to calculate a fair value of our single reporting unit, Waystar, and compared that value to the company’s carrying value as of October 1, 2024. As a result of this analysis, our fair value under each method exceeded our carrying value and therefore, no impairment was recorded.
Long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful life of long-lived assets periodically to determine if events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements—Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies)”.
JOBS Act Election
We are currently an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.
Item 7A.
Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business. Such risks are principally associated with credit risk and interest rate risk.
Credit Risk
Credit risk involves the possibility that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or client contract, leading to a financial loss. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to our clients are limited due to our diversified client base.
We routinely assess the financial strength of our clients through a combination of third-party financial reports, credit monitoring, publicly available information, and direct communication with those clients. We establish payment terms with clients to mitigate credit risk and monitor its accounts receivable credit risk exposure. However, while we actively seek to ensure credit risk, there can be no assurance that in the future it will be able to obtain credit risk insurance at commercially attractive terms or at all.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our First Lien Credit Facility, which bears interest at SOFR plus 2.25% as of December 31, 2024. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the current effective rate would have an impact on our interest expense of approximately $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
In order to limit exposure to risk, we maintain derivative instruments with creditworthy institutions to hedge against changing interest rate fluctuations. We utilize interest rate swap contracts and other non- derivative hedging instruments to manage such risk.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Waystar Holding Corp.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Waystar Holding Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Business
Waystar Holding Corp. (“Waystar”, “we” or “our”) is a provider of mission-critical cloud technology to healthcare organizations. Our enterprise-grade platform transforms the complex and disparate processes comprising healthcare payments received by healthcare providers from payers and patients, from pre-service engagement through post-service remittance and reconciliation. Our platform enhances data integrity, eliminates manual tasks, and improves claim and billing accuracy, which results in better transparency, reduced labor costs, and faster, more accurate reimbursement and cash flow. The market for our solutions extends throughout the United States and includes Puerto Rico and other U.S. Territories.
Risks and Uncertainties
 — We are subject to risks common to companies in similar industries, including, but not limited to, our operation in a highly competitive industry, our ability to retain our existing clients and attract new clients, our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships, the growth and success of our clients and overall healthcare transaction volumes, consolidation in the healthcare industry, our selling cycle of variable length to secure new client agreements, our implementation cycle that is dependent on our clients’ timing and resources, our ability to develop and market new solutions, or enhance our existing solutions, to respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards, the interoperability, connectivity, and integration of our solutions with our clients’ and their vendors’ networks and infrastructures, the performance and reliability of internet, mobile, and other infrastructure, the consequences if we cannot obtain, process, use, disclose, or distribute the highly regulated data we require to provide our solutions, impact of government regulations on our market, and our reliance on certain third-party vendors and providers.
On occasion, we enter into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future but have not yet been made. Historically, we have not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements.
We have entered into agreements with our directors or officers that may require us to indemnify them against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from their willful misconduct.
No liability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Reverse Stock Split
On May 15, 2024, we effected a 
0.605
-for-1 reverse stock split of our common stock and a 
0.605
-for-1 reverse stock split of our Class A common stock. The reverse stock split did not result in an adjustment to the par value of common stock or Class A common stock. The reverse stock split was originally made effective on May 15, 2024 with a 
0.62
-for-1 ratio and this was retroactively amended on May 22, 2024 which updated the ratio to 
0.605
-for-1. All references in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related Note 15, Note 17, and Note 19 have been updated to reflect the effects of the reverse stock split at the amended 
0.605
-for-1 ratio. The number of shares of common stock, Class A common stock, additional paid-in-capital, options to purchase common stock, and loss per share amounts, which are presented and disclosed in the financial statements and aforementioned footnotes, have been restated on a retroactive basis for all periods presented to reflect the effects of this action.
Initial Public Offering
In June 2024, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in which we issued and sold 
45,000,000
 shares of our common stock at $
21.50
 per share. We received total proceeds of $
914.3
 million after deducting the underwriters’ discounts and commissions of $
53.2
 million. Deferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly related to the IPO, were capitalized and offset against proceeds upon the consummation of the IPO. Through the date of the IPO, we had capitalized $
8.8
 million of deferred offering costs. These costs were offset against proceeds upon the consummation of the IPO.
As part of the IPO we granted the underwriters an overallotment option, for a period of 30 days from the date of the prospectus, to purchase up to 
6,750,000
 additional shares of common stock from us at the initial public offering price less the underwriting discount. On July 5, 2024, the underwriters exercised the overallotment option to purchase 
5,059,010
 additional shares of common stock, resulting in additional net proceeds of $
102.8
 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $
6.0
 million. The remaining option to purchase additional shares expired unexercised at the end of the 30-day period.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
The financial statements include the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive loss, statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, and statements of cash flows of Waystar and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Emerging growth company status
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies.
We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Segment information
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. We define the term “chief operating decision maker” to be our Chief Executive Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer reviews the financial information presented on an entire company basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating our financial performance. Accordingly, we have determined that we operate in a single reportable operating segment.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) revenue recognition, including estimated expected customer life; (2) recoverability of accounts receivable and taxes receivable; (3) impairment assessment of goodwill and long-lived intangible assets; (4) fair value of intangibles acquired in business combinations; (5) litigation reserves; (6) depreciation and amortization; (7) fair value of stock options issued to employees and assumed as part of business combinations; (8) fair value of interest rate swaps; and (9) leases, including incremental borrowing rate. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. We evaluate and update assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.
Principals of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Waystar Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Revenue Recognition
We derive revenue primarily from providing access to our solutions for use in the healthcare industry and in doing so generate two types of revenue: (i) subscription revenue and (ii) volume-based revenue, which account for 
99
% of total revenue for all periods presented. We also derive revenue from implementation fees for our software, as well as hardware sales to facilitate patient payments.
82

Table of Contents
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”), through the following five steps:
●
identification of the contract, or contracts, with a client;
●
identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
●
determination of the transaction price;
●
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
●
recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation
Our customers, referred to as clients elsewhere in this report, represent healthcare providers across all types of care settings, including physician practices, clinics, surgical centers, and laboratories, as well as large hospitals and health systems.
We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The length of our contracts vary but are typically 
two
 to 
three years
 and generally renew automatically for successive 
one-year
 terms. Our revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax and is recognized as, or when, control of these services or products are transferred to clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the contract’s performance obligations.
Revenue from our subscription services as well as from our volume-based services represents a single promise to provide continuous access (i.e., a stand-ready obligation) to our software solutions in the form of a service. Our software products are made available to our clients via a cloud-based, hosted platform where our clients do not have the right or practical ability to take possession of the software. As each day of providing access to the software solutions is substantially the same and the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as services are provided, these services are viewed as a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services.
Revenue from our subscription services is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the service is made available to the client. Volume-based services are priced based on transaction, dollar volume or provider count in a given period. Given the nature of the promise is based on unknown quantities or outcomes of services to be performed over the contract term, the volume-based fee is determined to be variable consideration. The volume-based transaction fees are recognized each day using a time- elapsed output method based on the volume or transaction count at the time the clients’ transactions are processed.
Our other services are generally related to implementation activities across all solutions and hardware sales to facilitate patient payments. Implementation services are not considered performance obligations as they do not provide a distinct service to clients without the use of our software solutions. As such, implementation fees related to our solutions are billed upfront and recognized ratably over the contract term. Implementation fees and hardware sales represent less than 
1
% of total revenue for all periods presented.
Our contracts with clients typically include various combinations of our software solutions. Determining whether such software solutions are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment. Specifically, judgment is required to determine whether access to the Company’s SaaS solutions is distinct from other services and solutions included in an arrangement.
We follow the requirements of ASC 606-10-55-36 through -40, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal Agent Considerations, in determining the gross versus net revenue presentations for our performance obligations in the contract with a client. Revenue recorded where we act in the capacity of a principal is reported on a gross basis equal to the full amount of consideration to which we expect in exchange for the good or service transferred. Revenue recorded where we act in the capacity of an agent is reported on a net basis, exclusive of any consideration provided to the principal party in the transaction.
The principal versus agent evaluation is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement and is dependent on whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the client or whether we are acting as an agent of a third party. This evaluation is performed separately for each performance obligation identified. For the majority of our contracts, we are considered the principal in the transaction with the client and recognize revenue gross of any related channel partner fees or costs. We have certain agency arrangements where third parties control the goods or services provided to a client and we recognize revenue net of any fees owed to these third parties.
83

Table of Contents
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although our standard payment terms generally require payment within 
30
 to 
60 days
. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payment, we have determined our contracts do not generally include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide clients with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our clients or to provide clients with financing.
Contract Costs 
Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract primarily include commissions paid to our internal sales personnel. We consider all such commissions to be both incremental and recoverable since they are only paid when a contract is secured. These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which is determined based on the average customer life, which includes anticipated renewals of contracts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total unamortized costs reported as deferred costs on our balance sheet amounted to $
29.0
 million and $
22.8
 million, respectively, for internal sales commissions. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, amortization related to the sales commission asset was $
10.7
 million, $
7.6
 million, and $
4.9
 million, respectively. The aforementioned amortization amounts are included in sales and marketing in our consolidated statements of operations.
Costs to Fulfill a Contract
We capitalize costs incurred to fulfill contracts that i) relate directly to the contract, ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations under the contract, and iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Costs incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated customer life if we expect to recover those costs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total unamortized costs reported as deferred costs on our balance sheet amounted to $
53.8
 million and $
43.0
 million, respectively, for fulfillment costs. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, amortization related to the fulfillment cost asset was $
12.3
 million, $
8.8
 million, and $
5.8
 million, respectively. The aforementioned amortization amounts are included in the costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.
There were 
no
 impairment losses relating to deferred costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Channel Partners
We account for fees paid to channel partners within sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recorded fees to all channel partners of $
65.3
 million, $
52.3
 million, and $
46.0
 million, respectively. As we are primarily responsible for contracting with and fulfilling contracts for the end user, we record revenue gross of related channel partner fees.
Cash and cash equivalents
We consider highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any credit losses in such accounts.
Restricted cash
For a fee, we provide lockbox solutions through a banking institution to certain clients. When participating customers’ cash is received from their clients or patients, it is deposited in a lockbox account owned by us and is contractually required to be disbursed to the participating clients the following day. Any funds residing in these accounts are categorized as restricted cash.
Our restricted cash balance also consists of cash collected on behalf of healthcare providers from patients that has yet to be remitted to the providers. There is also an associated liability corresponding to cash held for others.
84

Table of Contents
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are primarily generated from billings related to our cloud-based technology and do not bear interest. Unbilled accounts receivable arise when services have been rendered for which revenue has been recognized but the customers have not been billed. Substantially all accounts receivable are from companies in the healthcare service industry. Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are considered past due when they are outstanding beyond agreement terms. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based primarily on an analysis of historical collections experience, review of accounts receivable aging schedules, and specific identification of individual clients management believes to be at risk. If additional amounts become uncollectible, they will be charged to operations when that determination is made. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted, and recovery is deemed remote. If amounts previously written off are collected, they will be included as a deduction in general and administrative expense when received. Credit is extended based on historical experience with similar clients. Generally, collateral is not required.
Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows (in thousands):

Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes at rates based on the estimated useful lives and pattern of usage of the assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets are 
5 years
 for computer hardware and 
office equipment
, 
7 years
 for furniture and fixtures, and 
40 years
 for buildings. Purchased computer software is depreciated over the estimated useful life of 
3
–
5 years
. 
Leasehold improvements
 are amortized over the life of the lease or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Refer to Note 7 for more information on property and equipment.
Software licenses and maintenance contracts
Software licenses and prepaid software maintenance contracts are accounted for as prepaid expenses and are amortized over the related service period, which is typically twelve months or less. In instances where contracts exceed twelve months, a portion of the contract is recorded as other long-term assets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total unamortized costs of $
7.2
 million and $
5.5
 million, respectively, were included in prepaid expenses. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total unamortized costs of $
0.1
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively, were included in other long-term assets.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful life of long-lived assets periodically to determine if events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of the asset groups, then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. Refer to Notes 7, 8, and 9 for more information on long-lived assets.

Table of Contents
Goodwill
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
We account for goodwill under the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually on October 1st or whenever there is an impairment indicator. There was 
no
 impairment to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 8 for more information on goodwill.
Deferred Offering Costs
We capitalize within other assets certain legal, accounting, and other third-party fees that are directly related to our in-process equity financings, including the planned IPO, until such financings are consummated. After consummation of the equity financing, these costs are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received as a result of the offering. Should a planned equity financing be abandoned, terminated, or significantly delayed, the deferred offering costs are immediately written off to operating expenses. Through June 6, 2024, the effective date of the Prospectus for our IPO, we had capitalized $
8.8
 million of deferred offering costs, which were recorded in shareholders’ equity upon the completion of the IPO (see Note 1). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred offering costs capitalized were $
0
 million and $
5.4
 million, respectively.
Capitalized software development costs
We capitalize internal-use software costs under the provisions of ASC 350 which includes costs incurred in connection with the development of new software solutions and enhancements to existing software solutions that are expected to result in increased functionality. The costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once the software has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is complete and available for general release. Capitalized software development costs are recorded in property and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 
two years
. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There were 
no
 impairments of capitalized software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Research and development costs
Research and development (“R&D”) costs consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for employees engaged in research and development activities as well as third-party fees. All such costs are expensed as incurred, except for capitalized software development costs.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs, net of amortization, are reflected on our balance sheet as a direct reduction in the carrying amount of our long-term debt. In addition, debt issuance costs, net of amortization, related to our revolver debt are included in other assets. Debt issuance costs include fees paid to creditors and third-party fees incurred for the issuance of new debt. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the respective term of the debt instruments using the effective interest method, and amortization charges are included in interest expense.
Derivative instruments
We hold 
one
 interest rate swap maturing on January 31, 2026. We held 
one
 interest rate swap that matured on October 31, 2024 and 
two
 interest rate swaps that matured on November 30, 2022 designated as cash flow hedges to a portion of our outstanding debt. At inception and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether our swaps qualify for hedge accounting. These interest rate swaps have been deemed highly effective under ASC 815 so they meet the hedge accounting treatment criteria and qualify for hedge accounting. The swaps have been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities and any changes to the fair value are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Cash flows from interest rate swaps are reported in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.
86

Table of Contents
Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It also establishes a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
●
Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
●
Level 2—Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
●
Level 3—Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Swaps are Level 2 instruments whose fair value is derived from discounted cash flows adjusted for nonperformance risk.
Stock-based compensation
We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and members of the Board of Directors based on estimated fair values and when vesting criteria is assessed as probable of being achieved. We utilize the straight-line vesting method to recognize compensation expense for all service-based payment awards. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the consolidated statement of operations. Such expense consists of stock-based compensation expense related to stock option grants to employees and directors. See Note 17 for additional information.
We estimate the fair value of service condition stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (“Black-Scholes”). We estimate the fair value of the performance condition stock-based payment awards that include a market condition on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo pricing model. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Our determination of fair value is affected by an estimate of our stock value as well as assumptions regarding several highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected term of the awards. We estimate expected stock price volatility using historical data of a peer group of public companies.
Advertising costs
We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $
12.5
 million, $
10.5
 million, and $
10.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Any change in the valuation allowance is charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made. Deferred tax balances are presented as noncurrent liabilities. See Note 10 for additional information.
We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon examination by the applicable tax authority, based on the technical merits of the tax position, and then recognizing the tax benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized.
Interest and penalties on material uncertain tax positions are classified as interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

Table of Contents
Loss contingencies
In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, estimated losses from contingencies are accrued when both of the following conditions are met: (1) it is probable a loss has been incurred; and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any legal fees are recognized as incurred.
Revision of previously issued financial statements
In preparing fiscal year 2023 financial statements, we identified an error in our 2022 consolidated financial statements consisting of an understatement of deferred tax liabilities of $
7.8
 million, and overstatement of income tax benefit of $
7.4
 million and overstatement of other comprehensive loss of $
0.4
 million. We have concluded the error is not material to our fiscal year 2022 financial statements and have corrected the error in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 as well as the related disclosure in Note 10—Income Taxes. There was no impact to our total operating, investing, or financing cash flows as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023 - 07, “Segment Reporting-Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The standard is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. For public business entities, the ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The guidance will be applied retrospectively unless it is impracticable to do so. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 4 for further details.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. For public business entities, the ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the ASB issued ASU 2024-13, “Expense Disaggregation Disclosures.” The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed information about expenses that is critically important in understanding an entity’s performance, assessing an entity’s prospects for future cash flows, and comparing an entity’s performance over time and with that of other entities. For public companies, this ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this Update or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements.

Contract Liabilities
We derive our revenue from contracts with clients primarily through subscription fees and volume-based fees. Our payment terms with the client generally comprise an initial payment for implementation services, which includes client enrollment and the setup of contracted solutions on our platform. These implementation fees are due upon contract execution. Additionally, subscription fees are earned on an ongoing basis, which are invoiced monthly.
Client payments received in advance of fulfilling the corresponding performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities. Implementation fees are recognized over the customer life, with any unrecognized amounts deferred as contract liabilities. These amounts are reported as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet.

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, the transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are expected to be recognized for the next 
12 months
 and greater than 
12 months
 was $
52.2
 million and $
17.9
 million, respectively.
The transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) for executed contracts does not include revenue related to performance obligations that are part of a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less. Additionally, the balance does not include variable consideration that is allocated entirely to wholly unsatisfied promises that form part of a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services.
Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations and changes in the timing and scope of contracts, arising from contract modifications.

Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. We have one business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for products or components below the consolidated unit level. The geographical location of our customers has no impact on strategy or products offered. The “chief operating decision maker,” or CODM, assesses performance and allocates resources using a consolidated profitability metric as discussed below. Accordingly, we have determined that we operate in a single reportable operating segment.
Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. On a monthly basis, our CODM reviews the following financial information presented on a consolidated basis. The key profitability metric used for purposes of making key personnel staffing decisions, approving operating budgets and forecasts, and making strategy decisions is Net Income as detailed below. See Note 3 for our disaggregated revenue by type.

The fair values of our interest rate swaps are based on the sum of all future net present value cash flows. The future cash flows are derived based on the terms of our interest rate swaps, as well as considering published discount factors, and projected SOFR curve. The fair value of long-term debt was determined using the present value of future cash flows based on the borrowing rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities. The carrying value of our First Lien Credit Facility was $
1,163.5
 million and $
1,730.8
 million compared to a fair value of $
1,169.4
 million and $
1,735.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there is no balance for our second lien term loan facility given the paydown outlined below in Note 12. The carrying value of our second lien term loan facility approximated fair value as of December 31, 2023. There were 
no
 transfers in or out of Level 3 during the periods presented.

Acquisitions
HealthPay24 Acquisition
On August 3, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding membership interests of HealthPay24, which offers patient engagement and payment solutions. We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The total consideration paid was allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess consideration paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill for the acquisition primarily represents future customer relationships. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. We have included the financial results of HealthPay24 in the consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. Pro forma results, including the acquired business since the beginning of fiscal 2023, would not be materially different than the reported results. Revenue and net earnings since the completion of the acquisition were immaterial. The total consideration paid for HealthPay24 was $
31.4
 million which entirely consisted of cash consideration.

The fair values of the tangible assets were determined primarily using the income approach. The fair values of the acquired identifiable intangible assets were determined using Level 3 inputs such as discounted cash flows which are not observable in the market. Intangible assets acquired from the acquisition include customer relationships, developed technologies, and trade names and trademarks which are all amortized on a straight-line basis approximating the use of the assets. The useful lives of the acquired identifiable intangible assets are 
19 years
 for customer relationships, 
8 years
 for developed technology, and 
2 years
 for trade names and trademarks. The weighted-average remaining useful life for all acquired intangibles is 
12.1
 years. 
Total acquisition costs of $
0.9
 million were expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Olive AI Asset Acquisition
On October 31, 2023, we acquired certain assets of Olive AI, Inc.’s Clearinghouse and Patient Access businesses for total consideration of $
10
 million. We accounted for the Olive AI acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As part of the acquisition, we recognized total intangible assets of $
10.6
 million, including goodwill of $
6.5
 million.

 impairments of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment expense of $
4.6
 million related to leasehold improvements at closed office locations as general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Due to the relocation of one of our offices, we reduced the useful life of the related finance lease and leasehold improvement assets which represented $
17.9
 million of incremental depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2024. The aforementioned assets have been fully depreciated and disposed of as of December 31, 2024.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill has a balance of $
3.0
 billion as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment to record a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset for the future benefit of rollover options originally issued in 2019 in connection with a change of control. The recorded adjustment increased deferred tax assets by $
9.1
 million, decreased income tax benefit by $
0.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and decreased goodwill by $
10.0
 million.

Leases
We determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception. At the lease commencement date, we record a liability for the lease obligation and a corresponding asset representing the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and are recognized in expense using a straight-line basis for all asset classes. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred, which primarily include maintenance costs, services provided by the lessor, and other charges reimbursed to the lessor.
We lease office space and data center facilities with remaining lease terms ranging from 
one year
 to 
10 years
, some of which contain renewal options. The exercise of these options is at our sole discretion.
Certain of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. For leases held on or after January 1, 2022, we have elected the practical expedient under ASC 842-10-15-37 for all asset classes which allows companies to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Our leases do not contain an implicit rate of return; therefore, an incremental borrowing rate was determined. We assessed which rate would be most reflective of a reasonable rate we would be able to borrow based on credit rating and lease term.
Finance lease right-of-use assets of 
zero
 and $
16.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in 
property and equipment, net 
on the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the relocation of one of our offices (see Note 7), we reduced the useful life of the related finance lease right-of-use asset, which represented $
14.9
 million of incremental depreciation (excluding accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements) for the year ended December 31, 2024. We also reduced the useful life of the related operating lease right-of-use asset, which represented $
1.2
 million of additional operating lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was $
4.1
 million and $
2.9
 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 we recognized $
0.2
 million, $
0
 million, and $
0
 million expense for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The above unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as an increase in the deferred tax liability in the accompanying balance sheet. Years 2020 to 2023 remain open to examination by federal, state, or local tax authorities.
As of December 31, 2024, we had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, consisting of approximately $

Accounts Receivable Securitization
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
80.0
 million and $
70.0
 million, respectively, outstanding under a receivables financing agreement with a counterparty as the lender, which provides for a 
three-year
 receivables facility with a limit of $
80.0
 million (the “Receivables Facility”). On September 6, 2024, we drew $
10.0
 million on the Receivables Facility and used the proceeds to paydown $
10.0
 million on the First Lien Credit Facility (see Note 12). Pursuant to the Receivables Facility, we sell and/or contribute current and future receivables to Waystar RC, LLC as the Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”). The SPE, in turn, pledges its interests in the receivables to the counterparty, which either makes loans or issues letters of credit on behalf of the SPE. All receivables remain on our balance sheet as they continue to be the property of our consolidated entities under the securitization.
The interest rate under the Receivables Facility is 
1.61
% per annum above the SOFR rate with a minimum base of 
0
%. The SOFR is adjusted each thirty-day period to the thirty-day SOFR rate. Interest under the Receivables Facility is paid monthly in arrears. As of December 31, 2024, the effective interest rate for the Receivables Facility is 
5.95
%.
All principal under the Receivables Facility is due on October 31, 2026.
The Receivables Facility contains certain covenants which, among other things, require we maintain certain collection thresholds with respect to our accounts receivable. We were in compliance with all such debt covenants during the periods presented.

Debt
On October 22, 2019, we entered into a first lien credit agreement (the 
“
First Lien Credit Agreement
”
), which initially provided for a first lien term loan balance of $
825.0
 million and a revolving credit facility of $
125
 million. From then through 2023, we entered into various amendments that increased the first lien term loan balance to be $
1,730.0
 million outstanding and the revolving credit facility borrowing capacity to $
342.5
 million as of December 31, 2023. We refer to the term loan facilities under the First Lien Credit Agreement as the 
“
First Lien Credit Facility
”
 and the revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Agreement as the 
“
Revolving Credit Facility.
”
On October 22, 2019, we entered into a second lien credit agreement (the 
“
Second Lien Credit Agreement
”
), which initially provided a second lien term loan of $
255.0
 million. From then through 2023, we entered into various amendments that increased the second lien term loan balance to $
448.0
 million as of December 31, 2023 with a maturity date of 
October 21, 2027
. We refer to the term loan facilities under the Second Lien Credit Agreement as the 
“
Second Lien Credit Facility.
”
On February 9, 2024, we executed the Eighth Amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement whereby we extended the maturity date of the First Lien Credit Facility to October 22, 2029 and refinanced the outstanding balance of the facility resulting in a new outstanding loan balance of $
2.2
 billion (
“
February 2024 First Lien Refinancing
”
). We utilized proceeds from the amended First Lien Credit Facility to paydown the remaining principal and interest on the Second Lien Credit Facility (
“
February 2024 Second Lien Paydown
”
).
In connection with the closing of the IPO in June 2024 (see Note 1), we repaid $
909.1
 million outstanding principal and $
2.8
 million accrued interest on our First Lien Credit Facility (
“
June 2024 First Lien Paydown
”
). On June 27, 2024, we entered into the Ninth Amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement whereby the outstanding balance was repriced bearing an interest rate of 
2.75
% per annum above the SOFR rate with a minimum base of 
0.00
% (
“
June 2024 First Lien Repricing
”
). The Ninth Amendment did not effectuate changes to any other terms of the agreement.
In connection with the underwriters
’
 exercise of the overallotment option in July 2024 (see Note 1), we repaid $
110.9
 million outstanding principal and $
0.4
 million accrued interest on our First Lien Credit Facility (
“
July 2024 First Lien Paydown
”
). On September 6, 2024, we utilized the $
10.0
 million drawn on the Receivables Facility to paydown $
10.0
 million outstanding principal on our First Lien Credit Facility (
“
September 2024 First Lien Paydown
”
).
On December 30, 2024, we entered into the Tenth Amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement whereby the outstanding balance was repriced bearing an interest rate of 
2.25
% per annum above the 
SOFR
 rate with a minimum base of 
0.00
% (
“
December 2024 First Lien Repricing
”
). Additionally with the Tenth Amendment, the Revolving Credit Facility
’
s borrowing capacity was increased to $
400.0
 million bearing an interest rate of 
1.75
% per annum above the 
SOFR
 rate with a minimum base of 
0.00
% (
“
December 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Repricing

1.75
% per annum above the SOFR rate with a minimum base of

%.
Principal on the First Lien Credit Facility is payable in 
20
 equal quarterly installments with the remaining balance to be paid on October 22, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, there are 
19
 payments remaining. The First Lien Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We were in compliance with such debt covenants as of December 31, 2024.
Debt Issuance Costs
In connection with the February 2024 First Lien Refinancing, we capitalized creditor fees of $
2.8
 million and $
1.4
 million of third-party fees in connection with the issuance of new debt. Additionally, we recorded $
10.3
 million in third party fees that were expensed immediately, which were recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. As part of the February 2024 Second Lien Paydown, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $
8.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As part of the February 2024 First Lien Refinancing, we recorded a loss on extinguishment $
0.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. In connection with the June 2024 First Lien Paydown, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of $
9.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As part of the June 2024 First Lien Repricing, we recorded $
2.5
 million in third-party fees that were expensed immediately, which were recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of $
0.3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the June 2024 First Lien Repricing. We also recorded a loss on extinguishment of $
1.2
 million and $
0.1
 million in connection with the July 2024 First Lien Paydown and September 2024 First Lien Paydown, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2024. As part of the December 2024 First Lien Repricing we recorded $
1.2
 million in third party fees that were expensed immediately, which were recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, and a loss on extinguishment of $
0.3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we expensed previously capitalized fees and other debt issuance costs totaling $
0.4

 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, unamortized debt issuance costs were $
2.1
 million and $
2.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
​
13.
Derivative Financial Instruments
To mitigate the risk of a rise in interest rates on the First Lien Credit Facility, we entered into 
two
 interest rate swaps on October 13, 2021 and January 13, 2023. We attempt to minimize our interest risk exposure by fixing our rate through the utilization of interest rate swaps, which are derivative instruments. The interest rate swaps mitigate the exposure on the variable component of interest on our First Lien Credit Facility. Our swaps are entered into with financial institutions that participate in the First Lien Credit Facility. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit risk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.

Stock-based Compensation
Equity incentive plans
On October 22, 2019, the Board of Directors approved the Waystar Holding Corp. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan. Under this plan, we can issue up to 
9.9
 million options or other equity awards. The granted awards contain service criteria, performance criteria, market conditions, or a combination thereof for vesting and have a 
10
-year contractual term. Options with a service condition generally vest over 
5 years
 with 
20
% vesting in equal vesting installments. Options with a performance condition and a market condition vest based upon a change in control, initial public offering, or a sponsor distribution or deemed return if the investors have achieved specified levels of return on investment. In addition, as part of a change in control in 2019, 
3.4
 million fully vested rollover options remain outstanding.
The Board of Directors approved the Waystar Holding Corp. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Equity Incentive Plan”), effective as of June 6, 2024, the date of pricing of our IPO. Under this plan, we can issue non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards tied to the value of the Company’s shares. Under this plan, we can issue up to 
10
 million options and other equity awards. The number of shares available to be issued automatically increases on the first day of each fiscal year beginning next year by a number of shares equal to the lesser of the positive difference, if any, between 
5
% of the outstanding common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, minus the plan share reserve on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or such lesser number of shares as may be determined by the Board of Directors. Options with a service condition generally vest over 
5 years
 with 
20
% vesting in equal vesting installments. The restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan generally vest over 
4
 or 
5 years
 with 
25
% or 
20
% vesting, respectively, in equal vesting installments. As of December 31, 2024, 
4.6
 million shares were available for future grants under the plan.
The Board of Directors approved the Waystar Holding Corp. 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), effective as of June 6, 2024, the date of pricing of our IPO. A total of 
3,250,000
 shares of common stock are initially reserved for the ESPP. The number of shares available to be issued for the ESPP will automatically increase each fiscal year beginning next year by a number of shares equal to the lesser of the positive difference, if any, between 
1
% of the outstanding common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and the number of shares of common stock available for the issuance of shares pursuant to the plan on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or such lesser number of shares as may be determined by the Board of Directors. The number of shares available to be issued for the ESPP will not exceed 
27,000,000
 as outlined in the plan agreement. As of December 31, 2024, the ESPP has not been made available to employees and 
no
 shares have been issued.

Stock Options
We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the service condition options under all plans and the Monte Carlo pricing model to estimate the fair value of the performance condition options under the 2019 Waystar Holding Corp. Plan. We value both types of options at the grant date using the following assumptions:
●
Risk-free interest rate
—
reflects the average rate on the United States Treasury bond with maturity equal to the expected term of the option;
●
Expected dividend yield
—
as we do not currently pay dividends or expect to pay dividends in the near future, the expected dividend yield is 
zero
;
●
Expected term of stock award
—

under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, we utilized the simplified method due to the lack of historical experience activity for our Company. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award. Under the 2019 Waystar Holding Corp. Plan, it is based on historical experience that is modified based on expected future changes; and
●
Expected volatility in stock price
—
reflects the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the expected term of the stock option.
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
12.89
, $
19.66
, and $
15.66
 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had 
7.6
 million fully vested options with a weighted average exercise price of $
11.93
 per share, an aggregate intrinsic value of $
187.4
 million and an average remaining contractual term of 
4.1
 years. The total fair value of options vested for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $
9.5
 million, $
8.5
 million, and  $
7.2
 million, respectively.
In June 2024, we determined the vesting of all our performance condition options became probable as a result of the IPO (see Note 1). Therefore, we recognized an additional $
33.1
 million of stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2024 as the implicit service period for the awards established at the grant date had elapsed. As of December 31, 2024, there is no remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to the performance condition options issued under the 2019 Waystar Holding Corp. Plan.
Information pertaining to option activity under all plans (including rollover options) during the years ending December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised (the difference between the fair market value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price) was approximately $
7.3
 million, $
0.4
 million and $
0.3
  million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We expect to incur compensation expense of approximately $
51.8
 million over a weighted average of 
3.7
 years for all unvested time-based awards outstanding as of December 31, 2024.
RSUs
The RSUs granted on June 10, 2024 in conjunction with the IPO were valued at the IPO price. Subsequent RSU grants are valued using our common stock price as of the grant date based on the publicly traded value per NASDAQ, and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period. All vesting is contingent on continued service. 
The following table summarizes RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2024. There was no RSU activity prior to the initial grant of RSUs on June 10, 2024.

Board Leadership Structure and our Board of Director’s Role in Risk Oversight

The standing committees of our board of directors consist of an Audit, Compliance, & Risk Committee, a Talent & Compensation Committee, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our board of directors may also establish from time to time any other committees that it deems necessary or desirable.
Our board of directors has extensive involvement in the oversight of risk management related to us and our business. Our chief executive officer and other executive officers regularly report to the non- executive directors and the Audit, Compliance, & Risk Committee, the Talent & Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to ensure effective and efficient oversight of our activities and to assist in proper risk management and the ongoing evaluation of management controls. We believe that the leadership structure of our board of directors provides appropriate risk oversight of our activities.
Audit, Compliance, & Risk Committee
Our Audit, Compliance, & Risk Committee consists of Robert DeMichiei, who serves as the Chair, Priscilla Hung, Paul Moskowitz, and Vivian Riefberg. Ms. Hung, Ms. Riefberg, and Mr. DeMichiei qualify as independent directors under the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq and the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. DeMichiei qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. The purpose of the Audit, Compliance, & Risk Committee is to prepare the audit committee report required by the SEC to be included in our proxy statement and to assist our board of directors in overseeing:
●
accounting, financial reporting, and disclosure processes;
●
adequacy and soundness of systems of disclosure and internal control established by management;

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the members of our Talent & Compensation Committee has at any time been one of our executive officers or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, on the compensation committee or board of directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or Talent & Compensation Committee.
We have entered into certain indemnification agreements with our directors and are party to certain transactions with principal stockholders described in Part III, Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence—Indemnification of Directors and Officers” and “— Stockholders Agreement,” respectively.
Director Independence
Pursuant to the corporate governance listing standards of Nasdaq, a director employed by us cannot be deemed to be an “independent director.” Each other director will qualify as “independent” only if our board of directors affirmatively determines that he has no material relationship with us, either directly or as a partner, stockholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us. Ownership of a significant amount of our stock, by itself, does not constitute a material relationship.
Our board of directors has affirmatively determined that each of our directors, other than Matthew J. Hawkins, qualifies as “independent” in accordance with Nasdaq rules. In making its independence determinations, our board of directors considered and reviewed all information known to it (including information identified through directors’ questionnaires).
Background and Experience of Directors; Board Diversity
When considering whether directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes, or skills, taken as a whole, to enable our board of directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, our board of directors focused primarily on each person’s background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in each of the directors’ individual biographies set forth above. We believe that our directors provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business.
In evaluating director candidates, we consider, and will continue to consider in the future, factors including, personal and professional character, integrity, ethics and values, experience in corporate management, finance and other relevant industry experience, social policy concerns, judgment, potential conflicts of interest, including other commitments, practical and mature business judgment, and such factors as age, gender, race, orientation, place of residence, and specialized experience and any other relevant qualifications, attributes or skills.
Code of Conduct
We adopted a new Code of Conduct (the “Code of Conduct”) that applies to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Our Code of Conduct is available on our website. Our Code of Conduct is a “code of ethics,” as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. We will make any legally required disclosures regarding amendments to, or waivers of, provisions of our code of ethics on our website.

Insider Trading Policies and Procedures

It is the Company’s policy to comply with all applicable securities and state laws when engaging in transactions in the Company’s securities.

Equity Awards
Vesting Schedule
2019 Stock Incentive Plan
The stock options granted to our named executive officers under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan are divided into time-vesting stock options (50% of the stock options granted) and performance-vesting stock options (50% of the stock options granted).
The stock options have a ten-year term and vest as follows:
●
The time-vesting stock options vest over five years, with 20% vesting on each of the first five anniversaries of a specified vesting reference date, subject to continued employment or service with us through each applicable vesting date; however, upon a change of control, all outstanding unvested time-vesting stock options will vest in full immediately prior to the change of control.
●
The performance-vesting stock options begin to vest when and if investment vehicles affiliated with EQT, CPPIB, and Bain receive cash proceeds with respect to or in exchange for their equity securities of us equal to a 1.5x multiple on their collective investment in us, subject to the named executive officer’s continued employment or service with us through each applicable measurement date.
●
100% of the performance-vesting stock options vest when and if investment vehicles affiliated with EQT, CPPIB, and Bain receive cash proceeds with respect to or in exchange for their equity securities of us equal to a 2.5x multiple on their collective investment in us, subject to the named executive officer’s continued employment or service with us through each applicable measurement date.
●
To the extent the investment vehicles affiliated with EQT, CPPIB, and Bain receive cash proceeds with respect to or in exchange for their equity securities of us between a 1.5x and a 2.5x multiple on their collective investment in us, the performance-vesting stock options will vest based on linear interpolation.
In connection with a termination of employment or service for “cause,” or in the event of a “restrictive covenant breach” (each as defined in the applicable stock option award agreements), both unvested and vested stock options will immediately terminate and expire. See “—Termination and Change of Control Provisions—Equity awards” below for information regarding the treatment of stock options upon a qualified termination.

2019 Stock Incentive Plan
Our board of directors adopted the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, effective October 22, 2019, under which we have granted options to purchase shares of our common stock to certain eligible individuals. The 2019 Stock Incentive Plan was terminated effective as of the consummation of our initial public offering and no further stock awards will be issued under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan. 13,195,915 shares are reserved for issuance with respect to currently outstanding options granted under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan.
Awards under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan are generally subject to adjustment in the event of any (i) dividend (other than regular cash dividends) or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination, extraordinary sale, repurchase, or exchange of shares of common stock or other securities, or other similar transactions or events (including a change of control) or (ii) unusual or nonrecurring events affecting us, including changes in applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or the dissolution or liquidation of the company. In addition, in connection with any change of control, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, provide for the (a) substitution or assumption of awards, or acceleration of the vesting of, exercisability of, or lapse of restrictions on, awards; (b) cancellation of any outstanding awards that are vested as of such cancellation (or would vest as a result of the occurrence of a change of control) for payment to the holders thereof of the value of such awards, if any, as determined by our board of directors, including with respect to stock options, by payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of common stock subject to the stock option over the aggregate exercise price of the option (and, any stock option having a per share exercise price equal to, or greater than, the fair market value per share subject to the stock option may be canceled and terminated without any payment or consideration therefor); and/or (c) conversion or replacement of any award that is unvested as of the change of control event into, or with the right to receive a payment, based on the value of the award at the time of such conversion or replacement, as determined by our board of directors, that is subject to continued vesting on the same basis as the vesting requirements applicable to the corresponding award.
Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, unless permitted by our board of directors, stock awards may not be transferred by a participant, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
All awards under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan are subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment to the extent necessary to comply with (i) any clawback, forfeiture or other similar policy adopted by our board of directors or Talent & Compensation Committee and as in effect from time to time and (ii) applicable law.
2024 Equity Incentive Plan
Our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan in order to provide a means through which to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel. Awards under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan may be granted to any (i) individual employed by us or our subsidiaries (other than those U.S. employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement unless and to the extent that such eligibility is set forth in such collective bargaining agreement or similar agreement), (ii) director or officer of us or our subsidiaries, or (iii) consultant or advisor to us or our subsidiaries who may be offered securities registrable pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act. The 2024 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Talent & Compensation Committee or such other committee of our board of directors to which it has properly delegated power, or if no such committee or subcommittee exists, our board of directors.
The 2024 Equity Incentive Plan initially reserves 10,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance, which is subject to increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2025 fiscal year in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the positive difference, if any, between (x) 5.0% of the outstanding common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (y) the available plan reserve on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) a lower number of shares of our common stock as determined by our board of directors; provided, however, that this automatic share reserve increase shall not apply following the tenth (10th) anniversary of the effective date of the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan.
All awards granted under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan will vest and/or become exercisable in such manner and on such date or dates or upon such event or events as determined by the Talent & Compensation Committee. Awards available for grant under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan include, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares of our common stock, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards tied to the value of our shares.

Table of Contents
Awards are generally subject to adjustment in the event of (i) any dividend (other than regular cash dividends) or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of shares of common stock or other securities, or other similar transactions or events or (ii) unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company, including changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations, or other requirement. In addition, in connection with any change in control, the Talent & Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for any one or more of the following: (i) a substitution or assumption of, acceleration of the vesting of, the exercisability of, or lapse of restrictions on, any one or more outstanding awards and (ii) cancellation of any one or more outstanding awards and payment to the holders of such awards that are vested as of such cancellation (including any awards that would vest as a result of the occurrence of such event but for such cancellation) the value of such awards, if any, as determined by the Talent & Compensation Committee.
Our board of directors may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan or any portion thereof at any time, but no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, or termination may be made without stockholder approval if (i) such approval is required under applicable law, (ii) it would materially increase the number of securities which may be issued under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (except for adjustments in connection with certain corporate events), or (iii) it would materially modify the requirements for participation in the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan. Any such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, or termination that would materially and adversely affect the rights of any participant or any holder or beneficiary of any award will not to that extent be effective without such individual’s consent.
All awards granted under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan are subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment to the extent necessary to comply with (i) any clawback, forfeiture, or other similar policy adopted by our board of directors or the Talent & Compensation Committee and as in effect from time to time and (ii) applicable law.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In connection with our initial public offering, our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, the Waystar Holding Corp. 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). Under the ESPP, our employees and those of any designated subsidiaries or affiliates (other than employees who, immediately after the purchase right grant, would own stock representing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of our common stock), may purchase shares of our common stock, during pre- specified offering periods determined by the Talent & Compensation Committee.
The ESPP initially reserves 3,250,000 shares of our common stock for issuance, which is subject to automatic be increase on the first day of each fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the effective date of the ESPP occurred by a number of shares of our common stock equal to the lesser of (i) the positive difference, if any, between (A) 1.0% of the outstanding common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, and (y) the available share reserve of the ESPP on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, and (ii) a lower number of shares of our common stock as determined by our board of directors. The number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP is subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capitalization.
The ESPP is administered by the Talent & Compensation Committee, which has full authority to administer the ESPP and make and interpret rules and regulations regarding administration of the ESPP as it may deem necessary or advisable.
A participant may acquire common stock under the ESPP by authorizing the use of contributions to purchase shares of common stock. Contributions must not exceed 15% of the participant’s total compensation A participants may not acquire rights to purchase more than $25,000 of our common stock under the ESPP for any calendar year. Termination of employment for any reason will terminate participation in the ESPP.
A participant’s purchase right to purchase shares of common stock during a purchase period will be exercised automatically on the purchase period end date for that purchase period at a discounted per-share purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value per share of our common stock as determined on the applicable grant date of the purchase right or (ii) the fair market value per share of our common stock as determined on the applicable purchase period end date. Subject to the terms of the ESPP, a purchase right will generally terminate on the earlier of the date of the participant’s termination of employment or the last day of the applicable purchase period.

If there is any change in the outstanding shares of our common stock because of a merger, “change in control” (as defined in our 2024 Equity Incentive Plan), consolidation, recapitalization, or reorganization involving Waystar Holding Corp., or if our board of directors declares a stock dividend, stock split distributable in shares of common stock or reverse stock split, other distribution or combination or reclassification of our common stock, or if there is a similar change in our capital stock structure affecting our common stock, then the number and type of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will be correspondingly adjusted and, subject to applicable law, the Talent & Compensation Committee will make such adjustments to purchase rights or to any ESPP provision as the Talent & Compensation Committee deems equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of purchase rights or as may otherwise be advisable. In addition, the Talent & Compensation Committee’s discretion includes, but is not limited to, the authority to provide for any of, or a combination of any of, the following:
●
(A) termination of any outstanding option in exchange for an amount of cash, if any, equal to the amount that would have been obtained upon the exercise of such option had such option been currently exercisable or (B) the replacement of such outstanding option with other rights or property selected by the Talent & Compensation Committee in its sole discretion;
●
assumption or substitution of purchase rights by a successor entity (or parent or subsidiary of such successor);
●
adjustments in the number and type of shares (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding options under the ESPP and/or in the terms and conditions of outstanding options and options that may be granted in the future;
●
providing that participants’ accumulated payroll deductions may be used to purchase common stock prior to the next occurring exercise date on such date as the Talent & Compensation Committee determines in its sole discretion and the participants’ options under the ongoing offering period(s) shall be terminated; or
●
providing that all outstanding options shall terminate without being exercised and all amounts in the accounts of participants shall be promptly refunded.
The ESPP may be amended, altered, suspended, and/or terminated at any time by our board of directors; provided, that approval of an amendment to the ESPP by our stockholders will be required to the extent, if any, that stockholder approval of such amendment is required by applicable law or would be required under Section 423 of the Code.
Amendments to Outstanding Options Under 2019 Stock Incentive Plan
In connection with our initial public offering, the Talent & Compensation Committee approved an amendment to the outstanding option awards granted to our executive officers, including our named executive officers, under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan. The amendment provides that:
●
If the executive officer’s employment is terminated by us without “cause,” by the executive officer for “good reason” or as a result of his death or disability prior to the first trading window that commences after the 18-month anniversary of the IPO, the performance-vesting options held by such executive officer will not be forfeited upon such termination and will remain outstanding and eligible to vest in connection with any measurement date(s) occurring through and including the commencement of such trading window, subject to satisfaction of applicable performance hurdles; provided, however, that, if any measurement date occurs outside of the three-month period (or, with respect to the stock options granted to Mr. Hawkins on October 23, 2019, six-month period) immediately following such termination, the number of performance-vesting options that will be eligible to vest in connection with such measurement date will be prorated based on the period of time the executive officer was employed by us relative to the vesting period;
●
For purposes of calculating the achievement of the applicable performance hurdles following our initial public offering, all of our equity securities acquired by investment vehicles affiliated with EQT, CPPIB, and Bain following their initial investment in our equity securities will be deemed to have been acquired at the same per-unit purchase price as such equity securities acquired by them in connection with such initial investment;
121

Table of Contents
●
For purposes of calculating cash proceeds deemed received by investment vehicles affiliated with EQT, CPPIB, and Bain in connection with any trading window that commences after the 18-month anniversary of the IPO, the value of all of our equity securities held by investment vehicles affiliated with EQT, CPPIB, and Bain as of the commencement of such trading window will be calculated using a per share price equal to the volume-weighted average share price of such equity securities over the 20-trading day period ending as of the date of commencement of such trading window; and
●
If the executive officer’s employment is terminated as a result of his death, the executive officer will be permitted to “net exercise” his option awards granted under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan without the need for additional Talent & Compensation Committee approval.
In addition, on November 4, 2024, the Talent & Compensation Committee approved an amendment to the outstanding option awards granted to our executive officers, including each of our named executive officers, under the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “November 2024 Amendment”). The November 2024 Amendment modifies the alternative vesting terms pursuant to which performance-vesting options may vest following the 18-month anniversary of our initial public offering.
Specifically, the November 2024 Amendment provides that, from and after the date of the first trading window that commences after the 18-month anniversary of the IPO through the final measurement date, the performance-vesting options will be eligible to vest upon the first day of each trading window (each, an “Open Window Commencement Date”), subject to the participant’s continued employment through such date, based on the achievement of the following performance hurdles (the “Alternative Performance Hurdles”):
●
The performance-vesting stock options will begin to vest when and if the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the 20-trading day period (the “20-Day VWAP”) ending as of such Open Window Commencement Date is at least $24.81 (which represents the share price that would imply a 1.5x multiple on our sponsors’ collective investment in the Company).
●
100% of the performance-vesting stock options will vest when and if the 20-Day VWAP as of such Open Window Commencement Date is at least $41.35 (which represents the share price that would imply a 2.5x multiple on our sponsors’ collective investment in the Company).
●
To the extent the 20-Day VWAP as of such Open Window Commencement Date is between $24.81 and $41.35, the performance-vesting stock options will vest based on linear interpolation.
The November 2024 Amendment provides that the number of performance-vesting options that vest on each such Open Window Commencement Date will be reduced by the number of performance-vesting options that have previously vested prior to such Open Window Commencement Date. The Alternative Performance Hurdles replace the provisions in place prior to the November 2024 Amendment that would have treated the 20-Day VWAP as of an Open Window Commencement Date following the 18-month anniversary of the IPO as deemed cash proceeds for purposes of determining the achievement of the sponsor multiple of investment performance vesting objectives.

Policies and Practices Related to The Grant of Certain Equity Awards
We do not yet have a formal policy that requires the Company to grant, or avoid granting, stock options, stock appreciation rights, or similar option-like instruments to our named executive officers or other employees at certain times. We granted option awards to our executive officers and other employees in connection with our IPO and since our IPO, the timing of any equity grants has been in connection with new hires or promotions, the timing of which has been tied to the event giving rise to the award. As a result, in all cases since our IPO, the timing of grants of equity awards, including stock options, has occurred independent of the release of any material nonpublic information, and the Company has not timed the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of equity-based compensation. We anticipate that our Compensation Committee will consider whether to adopt such a policy in connection with our next grant of options, stock appreciation rights, or similar option-like instruments to employees.
During 2024, we did not grant any stock options, stock appreciation rights, or similar option-like instruments to executive officers during any period beginning four business days before the filing of a periodic report or current report disclosing material non-public information and ending one business day after the filing or furnishing of such report with the SEC.

Retirement Plan
We maintain a tax-qualified defined contribution 401(k) savings plan (the “401(k) Plan”), in which all employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate. The 401(k) Plan allows participants to contribute up to 75% of their compensation on a pre-tax basis (or on a post-tax basis, with respect to elective Roth deferrals) into individual retirement accounts, subject to the maximum annual limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The 401(k) Plan also allows us to make employer matching contributions. We have historically made employer matching contributions of up to 50% of our employees’ elective deferrals, limited to the first 8% of each employee’s compensation. Participants are immediately fully vested in their own contributions to the 401(k) Plan. Participants vest in the matching contributions we make to their accounts after 3 years of service, at the rate of 33 1∕3% per year.
Director Compensation
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid non-management and non-sponsor affiliated board members a cash retainer for their services as members of our board of directors. Our board members are reimbursed for reasonable travel and related expenses associated with attendance at board or committee meetings.
The following table provides summary information concerning compensation paid or accrued by us to or on behalf of our non-sponsor affiliated non-employee directors for services rendered to us during 2024.

Table of Contents
Effective upon the consummation of our initial public offering, we adopted an annual compensation policy covering each of our non-employee directors. Under this policy, each of our non-employee directors who is not employed by any of the Institutional Investors will receive (i) an annual cash retainer fee of $50,000, payable in equal quarterly installments and (ii) an annual equity retainer of restricted stock units with an initial value of approximately $200,000. The restricted stock units will be granted on the date of our annual meeting of stockholders and will vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant or the business day immediately preceding the date of the following year’s annual meeting of stockholders, if earlier, subject to the non-employee director’s continued service on our board of directors through such date. In addition, the non-executive chair of the board will receive an additional $100,000 cash retainer, the chair and the members of the Audit, Compliance, & Risk Committee will receive an additional cash retainer of $25,000 and $15,000, respectively, the chair and the members of the Talent & Compensation Committee will receive an additional cash retainer of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will receive an additional cash retainer of $15,000 and $5,000, respectively, each of which will be payable in equal quarterly installments.
Non-Employee Director Deferral Plan
Our Board of Directors adopted a Non-Employee Director Deferral Plan prior to the completion of our initial public offering. All directors who are not employees of the Company will be eligible to participate in the Non-Employee Director Deferral Plan.
Deferral elections. Under the terms of the Non-Employee Director Deferral Plan, our non-employee directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual cash compensation and/or all of the Company shares issued upon settlement of their annual restricted stock unit award, in each case, in 25% increments, in the form of deferred stock units credited to an account maintained by the Company. The number of deferred stock units credited in respect of annual cash compensation is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the deferred cash compensation by the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date the cash compensation would otherwise have been paid to the director. Deferred stock units will be awarded from, and subject to the terms of, the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan.
Each deferred stock unit represents the right to receive a number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of deferred stock units initially credited to the director’s account plus the number of deferred stock units credited as a result of any dividend equivalent rights (to which deferred stock units initially credited to a director’s account are entitled).
Settlement of deferred stock units
. Directors may elect that settlement of deferred stock units be made or commence on (i) the first business day in a year following the year for which the deferral is made, (ii) following termination of service on our board of directors or (iii) the earlier of (i) or (ii). Directors may elect that deferred stock units be settled in a single one-time distribution or in a series of up to 15 annual installments. In addition, deferred stock unit accounts will be settled upon a “change in control” (as defined in the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan) or upon a director’s death.
Administration; amendment and termination
. Our Talent & Compensation Committee will administer the Non-Employee Director Deferral Plan. The Non-Employee Director Deferral Plan or any deferral may be amended, suspended, discontinued by our Talent & Compensation Committee at any time in the Talent & Compensation Committee’s discretion; provided that no amendment, suspension or discontinuance will reduce any director’s accrued benefit, except as required to comply with applicable law. Our Talent & Compensation Committee may terminate the Non-Employee Director Deferral Plan at any time, as long as the termination complies with applicable tax and other requirements.

Item 12.       Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters
The information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the definitive proxy statement for our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders, which will be filed no later than 120 days after December 31, 2024.
Item 13.       Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence
Registration Rights Agreement
We are party to an amended and restated registration rights agreement with EQT, CPPIB, Bain, and certain equity holders, including members of management.
The amended and restated registration rights agreement contains provisions that entitle EQT, CPPIB, Bain, and the other stockholder parties thereto, including members of management, to certain rights to have their securities registered by us under the Securities Act. EQT is entitled to an unlimited number of “demand” registrations and CPPIB and Bain are each entitled to three “demand” registrations, subject to certain limitations. Certain stockholders are also entitled to customary “piggyback” registration rights. In addition, the amended and restated registration rights agreement provides that we will pay certain expenses of the stockholder parties relating to such registrations and indemnify them against certain liabilities which may arise under the Securities Act.
Stockholders Agreement
We are party to the Stockholders Agreement with EQT, CPPIB, Bain, and certain equity holders, including members of management.
The Stockholders Agreement and our certificate of incorporation provide that our board of directors will consist of ten members. EQT will have the right to nominate to our board of directors (i) two nominees for so long as EQT beneficially owns 25% or greater of our then-outstanding common stock, and (ii) one nominee for so long as EQT beneficially owns 5% or greater, but less than 25% of our then-outstanding common stock. CPPIB will have the right to nominate to our board of directors one nominee for so long as CPPIB beneficially owns 5% or greater of our then-outstanding common stock. Bain will have the right to nominate to our board of directors one nominee for so long as Bain beneficially owns 5% or greater of our then-outstanding common stock. EQT will have the right to designate the chairperson of our board of directors for so long as it beneficially owns at least 20% of our then-outstanding common stock, with the consent of CPPIB (not to be unreasonably withheld). For so long as CPPIB beneficially owns 10% or greater of our then-outstanding common stock, CPPIB will have the right to appoint one non-voting board observer, who will have the right to attend all meetings in a non-voting, observer capacity. In addition, our board of directors is divided into three classes and serve staggered, three year terms until the second annual meeting of stockholders after the date on which EQT, CPPIB, and Bain collectively own less than 15% in voting power of the then-outstanding power of the then-outstanding shares of stock of our Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, after which the board will no longer be divided into three classes. Furthermore, if any representatives of EQT serve on any boards or committees of our subsidiaries, CPPIB and Bain will have an equivalent right such that the board of directors of such subsidiary or committee thereof reflects, to the maximum extent possible, the composition of our board of directors and its committees as required under the Stockholders Agreement.
Subject to applicable laws and stock exchange regulations, and subject to requisite independence requirements applicable to such committee, the Stockholders Agreement and our certificate of incorporation provide that for so long as EQT, CPPIB, and Bain collectively beneficially own 5% or greater of our then- outstanding common stock, (i) the Bain director nominee will be appointed to serve on the Audit, Compliance, & Risk Committee, (ii) the CPPIB director nominee and one EQT director nominee will be appointed to serve on the Talent & Compensation Committee, and (iii) the CPPIB director nominee and one EQT director nominee will be appointed to serve on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we will include the EQT, CPPIB, and Bain nominees on the slate that is included in our proxy statement relating to the election of directors of the class to which such persons belong, subject to the ownership thresholds described above. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, EQT, CPPIB, and Bain will agree, severally and not jointly, with the Company to vote in favor of the Company slate that is included in our proxy statement.
129

Table of Contents
In the event that an EQT, CPPIB, or Bain nominee ceases to serve as a director for any reason (other than the failure of our stockholders to elect such individual as a director), EQT, CPPIB, or Bain, as applicable, will be entitled to appoint another nominee to fill the resulting vacancy.
First Lien Credit Facility
Affiliates of Bain and CPPIB are lenders under our First Lien Credit Facility.

Following the refinancing of the First Lien Credit Facility in February 2024, CPPIB no longer holds any of the loans under the First Lien Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding that was owed to CPPIB under the First Lien Credit Facility was $17.7 million, which, as of December 31, 2023, bore interest at a rate of 4.11% per annum above the SOFR rate, and the Company paid $0.4 million in principal and $2.7 million in interest.

Our related person policy provides that no related person transaction entered into following the completion of our initial public offering will be executed without the approval or ratification of our board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.
