Test Volume
The principal focus of our commercial operations is to offer our diagnostic tests through both our direct sales force and laboratory distribution partners. Test volume correlates with genomic database size and long-term patient relationships. Thus, test volume drives database diversity and enables potential identification of variants of unknown significance and population-specific insights. The number of exome and genome tests resulted and the mix of test results are key indicators that we use to assess the operational efficiency of our business. Once the appropriate workflow is completed, the test is resulted and details are provided to ordered patients or healthcare professionals for reviews, which corresponds to the timing of our revenue recognition. 
We believe the number of resulted exome and genome tests in any period is important and useful to our investors because it directly correlates with long-term patient relationships and the size of our genomic database. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we resulted 74,547 exome and genome tests, which represented 33% of all test results, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, in which we resulted 49,439 exome and genome tests, which represented 22% of all test results.
Success Obtaining and Maintaining Reimbursement
Our ability to increase the number of billable tests and our revenue therefrom will depend on our success in achieving reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors. Reimbursement by a payor may depend on several factors, including a payor’s determination that a test is appropriate, medically necessary, cost-effective, and has received prior authorization. The commercial success of our current and future products, if approved, will depend on the extent to which our customers receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors including commercial and Medicaid. Since each payor makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to provide coverage for our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse us for a test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process.
In cases where we or our partners have established reimbursement rates with third-party payors, we face additional challenges in complying with their procedural requirements for reimbursement. These requirements often vary from payor to payor and are reassessed by third-party payors regularly. As a result, in the past we have needed additional time and resources to comply with the requirements.
Third-party payors may decide to deny payment or seek to recoup payments for tests performed by us that they contend were improperly billed, not medically necessary or against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid. As a result, we may be required to refund payments already received, and our revenues may be subject to retroactive adjustment as a result of these factors among others. 
We expect to continue to focus our resources on increasing the adoption of, and expanding coverage and reimbursement for exome and genome, and any future tests we may develop or acquire. If we fail to expand and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue and our future business prospects may be adversely affected.

Ability to Lower the Costs Associated with Performing our Tests
Reducing the costs associated with performing our diagnostic tests is both our focus and a strategic objective. We source, and will continue to source, components of our diagnostic testing workflows from third parties. We also rely upon third-party service providers for data storage and workflow management.
Increasing Adoption of our Services by Existing and New Customers
Our performance depends on our ability to retain and broaden the adoption of our services with existing customers as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our success in retaining and gaining new customers is dependent on the market’s confidence in our services and the willingness of customers to continue to seek more comprehensive and integrated genomic and clinical data insights.
Investment in Platform Innovation to Support Commercial Growth
We operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Our business faces changing technologies, shifting provider and patient needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies on time. As our business evolves, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including investments through acquisitions and partnerships. These investments are critical to the enhancement of our current diagnostics and health information and data science technologies from which existing and new service offerings are derived.
We expect to incur significant expenses to advance these development efforts, but they may not be successful. New potential services may fail at any stage of development and, if we determine that any of our current or future services are unlikely to succeed, we may abandon them without any return on our investment. If we are unsuccessful in developing additional services, our growth potential may be impaired.
Key Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Diagnostic Test Revenue
The majority of our revenue is derived from genetic and genomic diagnostic testing services for three groups of customers: healthcare professionals working with patients with third-party insurance coverage or without third-party insurance coverage, institutional clients such as hospitals, clinics, state governments and reference laboratories, and self-pay patients. The amount of revenue recognized for diagnostic testing services depends on a number of factors, such as resulted test volumes, contracted rates with our customers and third-party insurance providers, insurance reimbursement policies, payor mix, historical collection experience, price concessions and other business and economic conditions and trends. To date, the majority of our diagnostic test revenue has been earned from orders received for patients with third-party insurance coverage. Our ability to increase our diagnostic test revenue will depend on our ability to increase our market penetration, obtain contracted reimbursement coverage from third-party payors, enter into contracts with institutions, and increase our reimbursement rate for tests performed.
Other Revenue
We also generate revenue from collaboration service agreements with biopharma companies and other third parties, pursuant to which we provide health information and patient identification support services. Certain of these contracts provide non-refundable payments, which we record as contract liabilities, and variable payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones during the contract term. 
With respect to existing collaboration and service agreements, our revenue may fluctuate period to period due to the pattern in which we may deliver our services, our ability to achieve milestones, the timing of costs incurred, changes in estimates of total anticipated costs that we expect to incur during the contract period, and other events that may not be within our control. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to enter into contracts with third-party partners.
Cost of Services
The cost of services reflect the aggregate costs incurred in performing services, which include expenses for reagents and laboratory supplies, compensation expenses for employees directly involved in revenue generating activities, shipping and handling fees, costs of third-party reference lab testing and phlebotomy services, if any, and allocated genetic counseling, facility 
57
Table of Contents
and information technology costs associated with delivery services. Allocated costs include depreciation of laboratory equipment, facility occupancy, and information technology costs. The cost of services are recorded as the services are performed.
We expect the cost of services to generally increase in absolute dollars with the anticipated growth in diagnostic testing volume and services we provide under our collaboration service agreements. However, we expect the cost per test to decrease over the long term due to the efficiencies we may gain from improved utilization of our laboratory capacity, automation, and other value engineering initiatives. These expected reductions may be offset by new tests which often have a higher cost per test during the introductory phases before we can gain efficiencies. The cost per test may fluctuate from period to period.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and future test offerings. These costs are principally associated with our efforts to develop the software we use to analyze data and process customer orders. These costs primarily consist of compensation expenses for employees performing research and development, innovation and product development activities, costs of reagents and laboratory supplies, costs of consultants and third-party services, equipment and related depreciation expenses, non-capitalizable software development costs, research funding to our research partners as part of research and development agreements and allocated facility and information technology costs associated with genomics medical research. Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred and certain non-refundable advanced payments provided to our research partners are expensed as the related activities are performed.
We generally expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we innovate and expand the application of our platforms. However, we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our development and commercialization efforts and fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses for employees performing commercial sales, account management, marketing, and certain genetic counseling services. Selling and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. 
We generally expect our selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our commercial sales and marketing and counseling teams and increase marketing activities. However, we expect selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, subject to fluctuations from period to period due to the timing and magnitude of these expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses for employees in executive leadership, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, and other administrative functions. In addition, these expenses include office occupancy and information technology costs. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.
We generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase headcount and incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to legal, accounting, and regulatory matters, and maintaining compliance with requirements of Nasdaq and of the SEC. We expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term as revenue increases, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in our compensation-related charges.

NM – Not Meaningful
Revenue
Total revenue increased by $102.9 million, or 51%, to $305.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $202.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Diagnostic test revenue increased by $106.5 million, or 54%, to $302.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $195.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable to a $109.2 million increase in exome and genome test revenue and an increase in other panel revenue of $5.0 million, which was partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in hereditary cancer test revenue and a $5.0 million decrease in legacy Sema4 revenues. The increase in exome and genome revenue was driven by a 51% increase in test volume coupled with higher reimbursement rates resulting from lower denial rates and improved collections. Full year and fourth quarter 2024 revenues includes $6.8 million of discrete benefit in connection with a multi-year appeal recovery from a single third-party payor. The fourth quarter benefit is composed of $5.8 million to exome genome revenues and $1.0 million to other test lines.
Other revenue, representing revenue from biopharma and/or data partnership, decreased by $3.6 million, or 52%, to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease reflected lower revenue from a partnership program which ended in 2024. 
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased by $104.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven by a combination of a favorable shift in volume mix to higher margin whole exome and genome tests, an improvement in exome average reimbursement rates and continued cost per test leverage.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses decreased by $12.5 million, or 22%, to $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to costs incurred in the prior year from the now discontinued Legacy Sema4 business, which included restructuring costs associated with headcount reduction actions and accelerated amortization for capitalized software no longer in use. 
Selling and Marketing 
Selling and marketing expenses increased by $6.4 million, or 11%, to $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase reflects our investment to support growth in our commercial team as well as incremental variable billing and selling cost
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses decreased by $32.6 million, or 24%, to $101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023
. The decrease was attributable to lower current period expenses related to professional services, software and information technology related costs, insurance costs, fixed asset depreciation and personnel-related costs from the now discontinued Legacy Sema4 business.
Impairment Loss
The non-cash charge of 
$10.4 million
 for the year ended 
December 31, 2023
 reflected the impairment of certain capital and right-of-use asset leases. See Note 5, “
Property and Equipment, net
” to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Other Operating Expenses, Net
Other operating expenses, net were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting related party expenses.
Other operating expenses, net were $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and included related party expenses of $5.3 million and a non-cash charge of $3.6 million to reserve for obsolete Legacy Sema4 inventory, partially offset by a gain of $1.7 million to recognize the sale of certain assets of Legacy Sema4. 
Non-Operating (Expense) Income, Net
Non-operating expense, net of $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily reflected a legal settlement, net of insurance, of $12.8 million, a non-cash charge of $10.1 million associated with the exercise of the Perceptive warrant and a non-cash charge of $3.3 million to account for the increase in fair value of our warrant liabilities. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $3.0 million. 
Non-operating income, net of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily reflected non-cash benefits of $1.2 million to account for the decrease in fair value of our warrants and contingent liabilities and $2.8 million for a principal loan forgiveness under the amendment to the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (“DECD”) loan, partially offset by $1.0 million in contract termination costs associated with the now discontinued Legacy Sema4 business. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.1 million.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”), we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to 
60
Table of Contents
review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.
Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We may in the future incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Other limitations include that non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect:
•
all expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
changes in our working capital needs;
•
the costs of replacing the assets being depreciated, which will often have to be replaced in the future;
•
the non-cash component of employee compensation expense; and
•
the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin
Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of services, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring costs. We define adjusted gross margin as our adjusted gross profit divided by our revenue. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as these metrics generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of 
December 31, 2024
, our existing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities were $141.2 million.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities provide us with sufficient liquidity for at least twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Nevertheless, we may also seek additional funding in the future through the sale of common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, by entering into other credit facilities or other forms of third-party funding, or other debt financing or by disposing of assets or businesses.
We have an effective shelf registration statement that we filed with the SEC in August of 2022, registering $300 million of shares of our Class A common stock and other securities. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $102 million of securities remained available under this registration statement. Further, we have entered into a sales agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with TD Securities (USA) LLC (“TD Cowen”) pursuant to which we may, but are not obligated to, offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our Class A common stock with an aggregate offering price up to $75.0 million through TD Cowen, as sales agent, subject to the terms and conditions described in the Sales Agreement and SEC rules and regulations (our “ATM offering”). As of December 31, 2024, approximately $26.8 million of capacity remained available under this ATM offering.
Material Cash Requirements for Known Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following is a description of commitments for known and reasonably likely cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We anticipate fulfilling such commitments with our existing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities or through additional capital raised to finance our operations.
Our future minimum payments under non-cancellable operating lease and finance lease agreements were $62.3 million and $31.9 million, respectively as of December 31, 2024. The timing of these future payments, by year, can be found in our consolidated financial statements in Note 9, “
Leases
”, included within this Annual Report.
As discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, in 2022, we entered into an agreement with one of our third-party payors to settle for $42.0 million claims related to coverage and billing matters allegedly resulting in overpayments by the 
62
Table of Contents
payor to Legacy Sema4. As of December 31, 2024, remaining payments due to the payor were $12.0 million. For more information regarding this matter, see Note 3, “
Revenue Recognition
” included within this Annual Report.
Our future contractual purchase commitments were $37.6 million as of December 31, 2024. The timing of these future payments, by year, can be found in our consolidated financial statements in Note 10, “

Operating Activities 
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $28.5 million, driven by lower cash expenditures in the current year as compared with the prior year, which reflected improved gross margin profitability, as well as the realization of cost savings from the exited Legacy Sema4 business and previously executed cost reduction initiatives.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $180.1 million, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of $175.8 million and unfavorable working capital associated with the wind down of the Legacy Sema4 accounts payable, primarily during the second half of 2023, which was partially offset by the release of a third-party payor reserve.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $30.1 million which included purchases of marketable securities of $66.3 million and $5.5 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $41.7 million in proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities.
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $43.7 million, which included purchases of marketable securities of $47.7 million, $12.1 million in consideration held in escrow paid for the Acquisition and $5.3 million in purchases of property and equipment, which was offset partially by $17.8 million in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and $4.0 million in proceeds from the sale of assets.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $44.2 million, which included $46.5 million in proceeds from our ATM offering, net of issuance costs, partially offset by $2.7 million of finance lease payments and $0.5 million of principal payments on the DECD loan.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $186.2 million, which was primarily driven by the $143.0 million net proceeds from the underwritten public offering and concurrent registered direct offering, net of issuance costs, and $48.5 million from the term loan facility with Perceptive (the “Perceptive Term Loan Facility”), which was offset partially by the DECD loan payment of $2.0 million and $3.6 million of finance lease payments.

Filer Status
Loss of Smaller Reporting Company Status
As the market value of our shares of Class A common stock held by non-affiliates was between $250.0 million and $700.0 million as of June 28, 2024 (the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter) and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was more than $100.0 million, we continue to be deemed an accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of December 31, 2024. However, we are no longer a “smaller 
63
Table of Contents
reporting company” and will no longer be eligible to rely on the scaled disclosure exemptions available to smaller reporting companies starting with our first Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in 2025.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). The JOBS Act allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We also intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) September 1, 2025, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about items that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
See Note 2, “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
” to our consolidated financial statements for a complete description of each of these critical accounting policies and estimates. Each of these critical accounting policies could potentially generate materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. Although actual results may differ from those estimates, we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when, or as, performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services are transferred to a customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer. Our contracts require significant judgments in determining the transaction price and satisfying performance obligations.
Diagnostic Test Revenue
We estimate a transaction price in arrangements with third-party insurance payors based on historical collection experience, contractual provisions and insurance reimbursement policies, payor mix, and other relevant information for applicable payor portfolios. The portfolio approach is used as a practical expedient to account for categories of diagnostic test contracts as collective groups rather than on an individual contract basis. Management believes that revenue recognized by utilizing the portfolio approach approximates the revenue that would have been recognized if an individual contract approach was used. For orders received for self-pay patients, we determine a transaction price associated with services rendered in consideration of implicit price concessions that are granted to such orders. The estimates for implicit price concessions require significant judgment and are based upon management’s assessment of expected net collections, business and economic conditions, historical trends, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. For institutional clients, the customer is the institution. We determine a transaction price associated with services rendered in accordance with the contractual rates established with each customer.
We monitor these estimates at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the initial estimate and any subsequent revision to the estimate contain uncertainty and require the use of judgment in the estimation of the transaction price and application of the constraint for variable consideration. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which could affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.

Other Revenue
We also recognize revenue from collaboration service agreements with biopharma companies and other third parties pursuant to which we health information and patient identification support services. Certain of these contracts provide non-refundable upfront payments, which we record as contract liabilities, and variable payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones during the contract term. Milestone payments are a form of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price only when it is probable that doing so will not result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the milestone is subsequently resolved.
For certain service or collaboration contracts that require us to transfer control of the service over time, we recognize revenue over time using an input measure based on costs incurred on the basis that this measure best reflects the pattern of transfer of control of the services to the customer. The measure of progress is developed using our best estimate of the performance period and the anticipated costs to be incurred to perform such services, including any subcontracted service costs.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily relate to interest rates. Our cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities and restricted cash consists of bank deposits and money market funds, which totaled $142.2 million and $131.1 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such interest-bearing instruments carry a degree of risk. However, because our investments are primarily high-quality credit instruments with short-term durations with high-quality institutions, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. 
A 100-basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. 
We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt associated with the Perceptive Term Loan Facility. Changes in interest rates can impact future interest payments we are obligated to pay.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of GeneDx Holdings Corp.
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GeneDx Holdings Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). These financial statements consolidate the operations and accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Unless otherwise noted, all tabular dollars are in thousands, except per share amounts.
Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. In addition, the Company was previously a “smaller reporting company”, as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K and currently takes advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. As such, the Company is eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including reduced reporting, including the reporting of two fiscal years of financial statements, not being required to provide an auditor attestation of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and extended transition periods to comply with new or revised accounting standards for public business entities. The Company has elected to avail itself of this exemption and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The Company bases these estimates on current facts, historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable in the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the transaction price for certain contracts with customers, potential or actual claims for recoupment from third-party payors, the valuation of stock-based awards, the valuation of warrant liabilities and income taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates, judgments and assumptions.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. 
The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are uninsured with account balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Company limits.
71
Table of Contents
The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are deposited with high-quality financial institutions. Management believes these financial institutions are financially sound and, accordingly, that minimal credit risk exists. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding its cash in excess of government insured limits and in the event of default by corporations and governments in which it holds investments in cash equivalents and short-term debt securities, to the extent recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. 
The Company assesses both the self-pay patient and the third-party payor that reimburses the Company on the patient’s behalf and, institutional billed clients when evaluating concentration of credit risk from customers. Significant patients and payors are those that represent more than 10% of the Company’s total annual revenues or accounts receivable balance at each respective balance sheet date. The significant concentrations of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were primarily from large managed care insurance companies, institutional billed accounts, and data arrangements. There was no individual patient or client that accounted for 10% or more of revenue or accounts receivable for any of the years presented. The Company does not require collateral as a means to mitigate customer credit risk.
For each significant payor, revenue as a percentage of total revenues and accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable are as follows:
Revenue

This payor group includes multiple individual plans and the Company calculates and presents the aggregated value from all plans, which is consistent with the Company’s portfolio approach used in accounting for diagnostic test revenue.
The Company is subject to a concentration of risk from a limited number of suppliers for certain reagents and laboratory supplies. One supplier accounted for approximately 
13
% and 
11
% of purchases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Another supplier accounted for approximately 
10
% and 
11
% of purchases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This risk is managed by maintaining a target quantity of surplus stock. Alternative suppliers are available for some or all of these reagents and supplies.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. If any changes in customer credit issues are identified which were not assessed at the date of service, provisions for credit losses are recognized and recorded.
Diagnostic test revenue
The Company’s diagnostic test revenue contracts typically consist of a single performance obligation to deliver diagnostic testing services to the ordering facility or patient and therefore allocation of the contract transaction price is not applicable. Control over diagnostic testing services is generally transferred at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the promised service which is upon delivery of the test. 
Diagnostic test revenues consist primarily of services reimbursed by third-party insurance payors. Third-party insurance payors include managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges, and employers. In arrangements with third-party insurance payors, the transaction price is stated within the contract, however, the Company accepts payments from third-party payors that are less than the contractually stated price and is therefore variable consideration and the transaction price is estimated. 
When determining the transaction price, the Company uses a portfolio approach as a practical expedient to account for categories of diagnostic test contracts as collective groups rather than on an individual contract basis. The portfolio consists of major payor classes based on third-party payors. Based on historical collection trends and other analyses, the Company believes that revenue recognized by utilizing the portfolio approach approximates the revenue that would have been recognized if an individual contract approach was used.
72
Table of Contents
Estimates of allowances for third-party insurance payors that impact the estimated transaction price are based upon the pricing and payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Contractual pricing and payment terms in third-party insurance agreements are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. In addition, for third-party payors in general, the estimated transaction price is impacted by factors such as historical collection experience, contractual provisions and insurance reimbursement policies, payor mix, and other relevant information for applicable payor portfolios. 
For institutional clients, the customer is the institution. The Company determines the transaction price associated with services rendered in accordance with the contractual rates established with each customer.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract and customer, however standard payment terms are generally less than 
60
 days from the invoice date. In instances where the timing of the Company’s revenue recognition differs from the timing of its invoicing, the Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised services to the customer will be one year or less.
Other revenue
The Company enters into both short-term and long-term project-based collaboration and service agreements with customers. Certain of these contracts include a license to directly access the Company’s intellectual property or participation by the Company on joint steering committees with the customer, which was considered to be immaterial in the context of the contract. The Company concludes that the goods and services transferred to our customers pursuant to these agreements generally comprise a single performance obligation on the basis that such goods and services are not distinct within the context of the contract. This is because the goods and services are highly interdependent and interrelated such that the Company would not be able to fulfill its underlying promise to our customers by transferring each good or service independently.
Certain of these contracts include non-refundable upfront payments and variable payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones or fixed monthly payments during the contract term. Non-refundable upfront payments received prior to the Company performing performance obligation are recorded as a contract liability upon receipt. Milestone payments are included in the transaction price only when it is probable that doing so will not result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the milestone is subsequently resolved. For longer-term contracts, the Company does not account for a significant financing component since a substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer is variable and the amount or timing of that consideration varies on the basis of a future event that is not substantially within the control of either party.
The Company satisfies its performance obligation generally over time if the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s services as the Company performs those services. The Company recognizes revenue over time using an input measure based on costs incurred on the basis that this measure best reflects the pattern of transfer of control of the services to the customer. In some contracts, the Company subcontracts certain services to other parties for which the Company is ultimately responsible. Costs incurred for such subcontracted services are included in the Company’s measure of progress for satisfying its performance obligation and are recorded in cost of services in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in the total estimated costs to be incurred in measuring the Company’s progress toward satisfying its performance obligation may result in adjustments to cumulative revenue recognized at the time the change in estimate occurs.
See Note 3, “
Revenue Recognition
” for more information.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of amounts invested in money market funds and debt securities. Carrying values of cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The current and long-term portions of restricted cash are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities are classified as current assets as these investments are intended to be available to the Company for use in funding current operations. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are deemed temporary and are classified in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. The cost of marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. We regularly evaluate our portfolio of marketable securities for expected credit losses and impairment for any decline in fair value determined to be other-than-temporary. In 
73
Table of Contents
making this judgement, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a marketable security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.
See Note 4, “
Fair Value Measurements
” for more information.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers and third-party payors for services performed and reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing those services. Accounts receivable is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not record provisions for credit losses.
 The Company wrote off $
0.4
 million of accounts receivable balances for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 
none
 for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Inventory, net
Inventory, net, which primarily consists of finished goods such as testing supplies and reagents, is capitalized when purchased and expensed when used in performing services. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company periodically performs obsolescence assessments and writes off any inventory that is no longer usable. Any write-down of inventory to net realizable value creates a new cost basis.

Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment includes assets under finance lease. Improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period realized.
Finance leases and leasehold improvements are amortized straight-line over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life. All other property and equipment assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from 
three
 to 
five years
.
The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the total estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is assessed using discounted cash flows or other appropriate measures of fair value.

See Note 5, “
Property and Equipment
”.
Intangible Assets, Net
Amortizable intangible assets include trade names and trademarks, developed technology and customer relationships acquired as part of business combinations. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. All intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, 
Property, Plant and Equipment
.
 There were 
no
 impairment losses recorded on intangible assets for any periods presented. 
See Note 6, “
Intangible Assets
” for more information.
Fair Value Measurements
Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. The following hierarchy lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market:
Level 1
: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.
74
Table of Contents
Level 2
: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable.
Level 3
: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of fair value but are supported by little to no market data.
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, other current liabilities, and long-term debt. The Company’s carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the relatively short-term nature of these accounts.

See Note 4, “
Fair Value Measurements
” for more information.
Warrant Liability
The Company accounts for warrants as liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant terms and applicable authoritative guidance in accordance with ASC Topic 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
 (“ASC 480”) and ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether the warrants meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815. This assessment is conducted at the time of warrant issuance. The warrant liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value on their respective issuance dates, with subsequent changes in respective fair values recognized on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each reporting date.
See Note 4, “
Fair Value Measurements
” for more information.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures stock-based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award on a straight-line basis. 
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards. Determining the fair value of stock option awards requires judgment, including estimating expected stock price volatility and expected option term. The Company estimates a volatility factor for the Company’s options based on analysis of historical share prices of a peer group of public companies, the historical share prices of the Company, and the implied volatility of the Company’s call options. The Company estimates the expected term of options granted using the “simplified method,” which is the mid-point between the vesting date and the ending date of the contractual term. The Company does not rely on the historical holding periods of the Company’s options due to the limited availability of exercise data. The Company uses a risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected term of the option. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid dividends.
Restricted stock awards are valued based on the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The Company issues new shares upon share option exercise and vesting of a restricted share unit. Forfeitures of stock-based compensation are recognized as they occur.
See Note 11, “
Stock-Based Compensation
” for more information.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on the Company’s historical operating losses, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. The amount of tax benefit recognized for an uncertain tax position is the largest that is more than 50 percent likelihood to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company records interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties, where appropriate, in income tax expense.

Leases
Under the accounting standards update (“ASU”) 2016-02, 
Leases
 to ASC Topic 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A lease qualifies as a finance lease if any of the following criteria are met at the inception of the lease: (i) there is a transfer of ownership of the leased asset to the Company by the end of the lease term, (ii) the Company holds an option to purchase the leased asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the leased asset, (iv) the present value of the sum of lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset, or (v) the nature of the leased asset is specialized to the point that it is expected to provide the lessor no alternative use at the end of the lease term. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company does not recognize a ROU asset or lease liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less and does not include variable costs, which are based on actual usage, in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. The ROU assets include any lease payments made prior to the commencement date and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives received. ROU assets are subsequently assessed for impairment in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy for long-lived assets.
All lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the associated payments, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate determined based on the rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments for similar term and in a similar economic environment on a collateralized basis, unless there is a rate implicit in the lease that is readily determinable. The lease liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the expected timing of payments.
The Company recognizes lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Variable costs are expensed when the event determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid occurs. Interest expense for finance leases is recognized based on the accretion of the lease liability. The Company has operating and finance lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases.

See Note 9, “
Leases
” for more information.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) in the form of ASUs to the FASB’s ASC. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs not included in the disclosures in this report were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-09”). The standard requires additional disclosures around disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
 (“ASU 2024-03”). The standard requires public business entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. ASU 2024-03 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”). The standard requires enhanced segment reporting disclosures, including significant segment expenses and other segment items. 
76
Table of Contents
Additionally, the standard requires public entities to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in financial statements unless it is impractical to do so. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 effective December 31, 2024 and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Reassessment of Variable Consideration
Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price, determined on a portfolio basis when applicable, are generally recorded as adjustments to revenue in the period of the change. The Company updates estimated variable consideration quarterly. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total change in estimate resulted in a net increase to revenue of $
15.1
 million and $
8.8
 million respectively, resulting from changes in the estimated transaction price due to contractual adjustments, obtaining updated information from payors and patients that was unknown at the time the performance obligation was met and potential and actual settlements with third party payors. The change in estimate also included an increase in revenue related to the release of a previously established payor reserve, as further disclosed in the “Certain Payor Matters” section below. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a discrete benefit of $
6.8
 million in connection with a multi-year appeal recovery from a single third-party payor.
Certain Payor Matters
As noted above, third-party payors, including government programs, may decide to deny payment or seek to recoup payments for tests performed by the Company that they contend were improperly billed, not medically necessary or against their coverage determinations, or for which they believe they have otherwise overpaid, including as a result of their own error. As a result, the Company may be required to refund payments already received, and the Company’s revenues may be subject to retroactive adjustment as a result of these factors among others, including without limitation, differing interpretations of billing and coding guidance, and changes by government agencies and payors in interpretations, requirements, policies and/or “conditions of participation” in various programs. The Company processes requests for recoupment from third-party payors in the ordinary course of its business, and it is likely that the Company will continue to do so in the future. If a third-party payor denies payment for testing or recoups money from the Company in a later period, reimbursement and the associated recognition of revenue for the Company’s testing services could decline.
From time to time, the Company may have an obligation to reimburse Medicare, Medicaid, and third-party payors for overpayments regardless of fault. Settlements with third-party payors for retroactive adjustments due to audits, reviews, or investigations are considered variable consideration and are included in the determination of the estimated transaction price for providing services. These settlements are estimated based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payor, correspondence from the payor, the Company’s historical settlement activity (if any), and the Company’s assessment of the probability a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved. Estimated settlements are adjusted in future periods as such adjustments become known (that is, if new information becomes available), or as years are settled or are no longer subject to such audits, reviews, and investigations.
77
Table of Contents
On December 30, 2022, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with one of its third-party payors (the “Payor”) in order to settle the claims related to coverage and billing matters allegedly resulting in the overpayments by the Payor to Legacy Sema4 (the “Disputed Claims”). Under the settlement agreement, $
42.0
 million is to be paid by the Company to the Payor in a series of payments each year through June 30, 2026. The first installment payment of $
15.0
 million was made on December 31, 2022, the second installment of $
5.0
 million was made on December 27, 2023, and the third installment of $
10.0
 million was made on December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, $
12.0
 million in scheduled payments under the agreement remain, with $
10.0
 million due in December 2025 and $
2.0
 million in 2026. In consideration for these payments, the Payor provided releases of the Disputed Claims, effective March 31, 2023. 
As a result of this matter, and in connection with a review of certain billing policies and procedures undertaken by management, the Company considered the need to establish reserves for potential recoupments of payments previously made by third-party payors. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $
12.6
 million and $
27.0
 million of liabilities were recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively. The Company uses estimates, judgments, and assumptions to assess whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue may occur in future periods, based upon information presently available. These estimates are subject to change. In addition, as discussed above, the Company has made certain adjustments to its estimated variable consideration as result of this matter and other potential settlements with payors.

Fair Value Measurements
Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. For further information regarding the Company’s fair value measurements, see Note 2, “
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Table of Contents
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.
The Company’s financial assets include investments in money market funds, U.S. treasury bonds, and corporate and municipal bonds. Investments in money market funds are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are based on quoted prices in active markets. Investments in U.S. treasury bonds and corporate and municipal bonds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets.
The Company’s marketable securities presented in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 have maturity dates ranging from 2025 through 2027 and are classified as current assets as these investments are intended to be readily available to fund current operations. The differences between the fair value and amortized cost basis of each security are the unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2024, the amortized cost for maturities less than one year and greater than one year were $
36.6
 million and $
18.3
 million, respectively.
Public and Private Warrants
As of the consummation of the CMLS and Legacy Sema4 Business Combination in July 2021, there were 
666,516
 warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock outstanding, including 
447,223
 public warrants and 
219,293
 private placement warrants. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
666,515
 warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock outstanding, including 
457,323
 public warrants and 
209,192
 private placement warrants outstanding. Each warrant expires 
five years
 after the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation, and entitles the holder to purchase 
one
 share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $
379.50
 per share, subject to adjustment, at any time commencing on September 4, 2021.
The Company may redeem the outstanding public warrants if the price per share of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $
594.00
 as described below:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at a price of $
0.33
 per public warrant;
•
upon not less than 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and
•
if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $
594.00
 per share (as adjusted) for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
-trading day period ending 
three
 trading days before sending the notice of redemption to warrant holders.
The Company may redeem the outstanding public warrants if the price per share of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $
330.00
 as described below:
•
in whole and not in part;
•
at $
3.30
 per warrant upon a minimum of 
30
 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the common stock;
•
if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $
330.00
 per share (as adjusted) for any 
20
 trading days within the 
30
-trading day period ending 
three
 trading days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
•
if the closing price of the common stock for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
-trading day period ending 
three
 trading days before the Company sends notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than $
594.00
 per share (as adjusted), the private placement warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as described above.
The private placement warrants were issued to CMLS Holdings, LLC, Mr. Munib Islam, Dr. Emily Leproust and Mr. Nat Turner, and are identical to the public warrants underlying the units sold in the initial public offering, except that (1) the private placement warrants and the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants would not be transferable, assignable or salable until 
30
 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions, (2) the private placement warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis, (3) the private placement warrants are non-redeemable (except as described above, upon a redemption of warrants when the price per share of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $
330.00
) so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, and (4) the holders of the private placement warrants and the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants have certain registration rights. If the private placement warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the public warrants.
The public warrants are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as they are traded in active markets and the fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market prices. The private placement warrants are classified within Level 2 of the fair value 
79
Table of Contents
hierarchy as management determined the fair value of each private placement warrant is the same as that of a public warrant because the terms are substantially the same. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, a loss of $
3.3
 million and gain of $
0.2
 million was recorded within the change in the change in fair market value of warrants and contingent liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, respectively.
Perceptive Warrant
O
n October 27, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty (the “Credit Agreement”) with Perceptive Credit Holdings IV, LP, as lender and administrative agent (“Perceptive”), which provides for a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
75.0
 million (the “Perceptive Term Loan Facility”). As consideration for the Credit Agreement, the Company issued to Perceptive a warrant to purchase up to 
1,200,000
 shares (the “Perceptive Warrants”) of its Class A common stock. 
800,000
 warrant shares (the “Initial Warrant Shares”) vested and became exercisable on the Closing Date and 
400,000
 warrant shares (the “Additional Warrant Shares” and, together with the Initial Warrant Shares, the “Warrant Shares”) would have potentially vested and become exercisable on the Tranche B Borrowing Date, as defined in Note 8, “

” included within this Annual Report. As the Company did not seek the additional funding from the Tranche B Loan, the Additional Warrant Shares did not vest and are not exercisable. 
On April 30, 2024 (the “Exercise Date”) Perceptive provided the Company with a notice to exercise the Initial Warrant Shares at an aggregate exercise price of $
2.5
 million and, as payment of the aggregate exercise price, instructed the Company to withhold a number of Initial Warrant Shares based on their aggregate fair market value as of the Exercise Date. The fair market value price of each Initial Warrant Share was equal to the 
1-day
 volume weighted average price (the “
1-day
 VWAP”) of the Company’s Class A common stock on the Exercise Date, or $
16.4321
. As a result, the Company issued 
645,414
 shares of its Class A common stock to Perceptive in satisfaction of the cashless exercise in respect of the Initial Warrant Shares. See Note 8, “
Long-Term Debt
” included within this Annual Report for further information.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, a loss of $
10.1
 million was recorded within the change in fair market value of warrants and contingent liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on re-measurement performed as of the Exercise Date.
Contingent Consideration
In connection with the Acquisition, up to $
150.0
 million of contingent payments was to be payable to OPKO Health, Inc. (“OPKO”), based upon achievement of 2022 and 2023 revenue milestones (the “Milestone Payments”) pursuant to the merger agreement (the “Acquisition Merger Agreement”). The first Milestone Payment was paid out in full in April 2023 and the second Milestone Payment was valued at zero as the milestone was not met during fiscal year 2023.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, a gain of $
0.9
 million was recorded in the change in fair market value of warrants and contingent liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development Funding Commitment
The Company’s loan from the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (“DECD”) is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The loan was recorded at its carrying value of $
5.8
 million and $
6.3
 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with $
1.2
 million of recorded in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024. The fair value was $
4.9
 million, which is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the yields of similar debt instruments of other companies with similar credit profiles.

Perceptive Term Loan Facility
O
n October 27, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into the Perceptive Term Loan Facility. An initial tranche of $
50.0
 million (the “Tranche A Loan”) was funded under the Perceptive Term Loan Facility on the Closing Date. In addition to the Tranche A Loan, the Perceptive Term Loan Facility included an additional tranche of $
25.0
 million (the “Tranche B Loan,” and together with the Tranche A Loan, the “Term Loans”), which was accessible by the Company through December 31, 2024 so long as the Company satisfied certain customary conditions precedent, including a specified revenue milestone (the funding date of the Tranche B Loan, the “Tranche B Borrowing Date”). Although the requirements for the Tranche B funding were met, the Company did not seek the additional funding. 
The Perceptive Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of October 27, 2028 (the “Maturity Date”) and provides for an interest-only period during the term of the loan with principal due at the maturity date. The Company’s net proceeds from the Tranche A Loan were approximately $
48.8
 million, after deducting debt issuance costs and expenses.
Interest Rate
The Perceptive Term Loan Facility will accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (b) an applicable margin of 
7.5
% (the “Applicable Margin”). Accrued interest on the Term Loans is payable monthly in arrears. Upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Applicable Margin will automatically increase by an additional 
4
% per annum.
Amortization and Prepayment
Prior to the Maturity Date, there will be no scheduled principal payments under the Perceptive Term Loan Facility. On the Maturity Date, the Company is required to pay Perceptive the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Term Loans may be prepaid at any time, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 
0
% to 
10
% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount being prepaid, depending on the date of prepayment.

Security Instruments and Warrant
In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company also entered into a Security Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, with Perceptive, pursuant to which all of its obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first lien perfected security interest on substantially all of its existing and after-acquired assets, subject to customary exceptions.
On the Closing Date, as consideration for the Credit Agreement, the Company issued the Perceptive Warrant to Perceptive, which allowed them to purchase up to 
1,200,000
 Warrant Shares. The 
800,000
 Initial Warrant Shares vested and became exercisable on the Closing Date and 
400,000
 Additional Warrant Shares would have potentially vested and become exercisable on the Tranche B Borrowing Date. As the Company did not seek the additional funding from the Tranche B Loan, the Additional Warrant Shares did not vest and are not exercisable. The per share exercise price for the Initial Warrant Shares is $
3.1752
 (the “Initial Warrant Exercise Price”), which is equal to the
10-day
 volume weighted average price (the “
10-day
 VWAP”) of the Company’s Class A common stock at the end of the business day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the per share exercise price for the Additional Warrant Shares would have been equal to the lower of (a) the Initial Warrant Exercise Price or (b) the 
10-day
 VWAP ending on the end of the business day immediately preceding the Tranche B Borrowing Date. The Perceptive Warrant will be exercisable, in whole or in part, until the 
10
th anniversary of the applicable vesting date. 
On April 30, 2024, Perceptive provided the Company with a notice to exercise the Initial Warrant Shares at an aggregate exercise price of $
2.5
 million and instructed the Company to withhold a number of Initial Warrant Shares as payment for the aggregate exercise price. As a result, the Company issued 
645,414
 shares of its Class A common stock in satisfaction of the cashless exercise in respect of the Initial Warrant Shares. See Note 4, “
Fair Value Measurement
” for further information.
Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development Funding Commitment
In June 2017, ISMMS assigned a loan funding commitment from the DECD to the Company (the “DECD Loan Agreement”) to support the Genetic Sequencing Laboratory Project in Branford, Connecticut, with funding based on the achievement of certain project development phases. The DECD Loan Agreement provided for a total loan commitment of $
15.5
 million at a fixed annual interest rate of 
2.0
% for a term of 
10
 years. The Company was required to make interest-only payments through July 2023 and principal and interest payments commencing in August 2023. The final payment of principal and interest was due in July 2028. However, under the terms of the DECD Loan Agreement, the DECD granted a partial principal loan forgiveness of up to $
12.3
 million in the aggregate. Such forgiveness was contingent upon the Company achieving certain job creation and retention milestones and $
4.5
 million had been forgiven at December 31, 2022. This commitment was collateralized by a security interest in certain machinery and equipment the Company acquired from ISMMS, as defined in a separate security agreement.
In January 2023, the Company amended the DECD Loan Agreement, which resulted in the Company agreeing to pay $
2.0
 million in principal, obtaining $
2.8
 million in debt forgiveness for achieving its Phase 2 job milestone, and agreeing to 
two
 new forgiveness milestone targets for its Phase 3 job milestone (eligible for $
2.0
 million in forgiveness) and a final phase job milestone (eligible for $
1.0
 million in forgiveness) (the “2022 Amended DECD Loan Agreement”). Upon execution of this amendment, the Company paid the $
2.0
 million in principal and received $
2.8
 million in debt forgiveness, and the Company recognized the debt forgiveness as other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023. The terms of the 2022 Amended DECD Loan Agreement require the Company to make interest-only payments through July 2024 and requires the Company to make principal and interest payments commencing in August 2024 through July 2029 at the same fixed annual interest rate of 
2.0
%. The other terms of the 2022 Amended DECD Loan Agreement remained the same.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company made principal payments totaling $
0.5
 million. The outstanding loan balance of the DECD loan was $
5.8
 million at December 31, 2024.
9. 
Leases
The Company’s leases primarily consist of office and lab space, and equipment for use in its operations. Its leases generally have lease agreements which expire in 2026 to 2036, some with the option to extend. The Company includes extension options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the lease terms. As of December 31, 2024, none of the Company’s lease terms included the extension option as the Company has determined that it is unlikely to exercise the extension option.
Operating Leases
The Company’s primary operating lease arrangements include leased properties for its corporate office and headquarters located in Stamford, Connecticut, its primary operating laboratory located in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and a satellite meeting space located in New York City. The lease agreements for these properties expire in 2034, 2031, and 2026, respectively.
84
Table of Contents
The Company’s operating leases also include laboratories in Branford, Connecticut and Stamford, Connecticut, which as previously disclosed, have ceased operations as part of the Company’s announced exits in 2022 from reproductive health and somatic tumor testing. The lease agreements for these properties expire in 2030 and 2036, respectively. These facilities as well as a portion of its headquarters located in Stamford, Connecticut are actively being marketed for sublet; however, the outstanding lease obligations remain obligations. At inception of the lease for the laboratory in Stamford, Connecticut, the value of the land was determined to be more than 25% of the total value and therefore the building is accounted for as a finance lease and the land as an operating lease.
Finance Leases
In addition to its leased laboratory building in Stamford, Connecticut noted above, the Company routinely enters into various finance lease agreements to obtain laboratory equipment that contain bargain purchase commitments at the end of the lease term. The leases are secured by the underlying equipment.

Contingencies
The Company is or may become subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any existing matters will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated 
86
Table of Contents
financial statements. However, no assurance can be given that the ultimate resolution of such proceedings will not materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
Except as described below, the Company was not a party to any material legal proceedings as of December 31, 2024, nor is it a party to any material legal proceedings as of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 
On September 7, 2022, a shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, styled Helo v. Sema4 Holdings Corp., et al, 22-cv-1131 (D. Conn.) against the Company and certain of the Company’s current and former officers. Following the appointment of a lead plaintiff, an amended complaint was filed on January 30, 2023. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on August 21, 2023, and that motion was granted on July 31, 2024. A second amended complaint was filed on September 13, 2024. As amended, the complaint purports to bring suit on behalf of the stockholders who purchased the Company’s publicly traded securities between January 18, 2022 and August 15, 2022. The second amended complaint purports to allege that the defendants made false and misleading statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and seeks unspecified compensatory damages, fees, and costs. The Company believes the allegations and claims are without merit.
On November 28, 2023, a stockholder filed a derivative suit, allegedly on behalf of the Company, based largely on the same allegations in the securities class action referenced above. The suit was filed in federal court in the District of Delaware, styled Ghazaleh v. Schadt, et al, 23-cv-01357 (D. Del.), and purports to assert claims against certain of the Company’s former and current officers and directors under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and corporate waste. The Company is named only as a nominal defendant. The complaint seeks damages on the Company’s behalf, and seeks corporate governance and other relief. On March 11, 2024, the Court issued an order staying this suit pending resolution of the Helo class action referenced above.
On June 25, 2024, a substantially similar stockholder derivative suit was filed in federal court in the District of Connecticut, styled Scinto v. Schadt, et al, 2:24-cv-01100 (D. Conn.). The suit, also purportedly brought on the Company’s behalf against certain of its former or current officers and directors, asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, corporate waste, and violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act. The Company is named only as a nominal defendant. The complaint seeks damages on the Company’s behalf, as well as corporate governance reforms and other relief. On August 8, 2024, the Court issued an order staying this suit until the earlier of a commencement of discovery, announcement of settlement, or dismissal with prejudice in the Helo class action referenced above.
On February 7, 2023, a stockholder commenced a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The suit is brought as a class action on behalf of stockholders of CMLS who did not redeem their shares in connection with the Business Combination between CMLS and Legacy Sema4. The defendants named in the amended complaint include and directors of CMLS at the time of the transaction, including certain directors who continue to serve on the Company’s Board of Directors, as well as CMLS Holdings LLC, Corvex Management LP, and Casdin Capital, LLC. The Company is not named as a defendant. The complaint alleges that the July 2, 2021 proxy statement mailed to CMLS stockholders in connection with the transaction contained false and misleading statements, and purports to assert a claim of breach of fiduciary duty against all individual defendants, and a similar claim against CMLS Holdings LLC and certain individuals for breach of fiduciary duty as control persons. The suit seeks to recover unspecified damages on behalf of the alleged class, among other relief. After defendants moved to dismiss the case, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on July 6, 2023, revising certain allegations and adding third parties as defendants. The defendants answered the amended complaint on September 15, 2023. The Company is subject to certain claims for advancement and indemnification by the individual defendants in this proceeding.
During the second quarter of 2024, the parties reached an agreement in principle through mediation to resolve all claims for approximately $
21
 million, and during the third quarter of 2024, the parties executed a formal stipulation of settlement reflecting such agreement in principle. The settlement was paid into escrow on November 12, 2024 and was funded by the Company (based on its indemnification obligations), available insurance of approximately $
10
 million and proceeds of approximately $
1.4

Stock Incentive Plans
The Company maintains the Amended and Restated 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “2021 Plan”), which allows for grants of stock-based awards. 
No
 awards granted under the 2021 Plan are exercisable after 
10
 years from the date of grant, and the awards granted under the 2021 Plan generally vest over a 
four-year
 period on a graded vesting basis; however, the Company has also granted certain restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with vesting terms beginning 12 months from the grant date and vesting immediately on the grant date. On January 1 of each year through 2031, the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan may be increased automatically by the number of shares equal to 
5
% of the total number of shares of all classes of common stock issued and outstanding immediately preceding December 31. In January 2024, the number of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Plan automatically increased by 
1,298,943
 shares.
The Company also maintains the 2023 Equity Inducement Plan (the “Equity Inducement Plan”), which allows for grants of equity awards of the Company’s Class A common stock to individuals who were not previously an employee or director of the Company, or following a bona fide period of non-employment, as an inducement material to such persons entering into employment with the Company. 
As of December 31, 2024, there was an aggregate of 
1,857,260
 shares available for grants of stock options or other awards under the 2021 Plan and Equity Inducement Plan. In January 2025, the number of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2021 Plan automatically increased by 
1,400,827
 shares.

four-year
 vesting period from the grant date, however, the Company also granted certain RSUs with vesting term beginning 
12
 months from the grant date and vesting immediately on the grant date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2021 ESPP”) authorizes the issuance of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees. On January 1 of each year through 2031, the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 ESPP may be increased automatically by the number of shares equal to 
1
% of the total number of shares of all classes of common stock issued and outstanding immediately preceding December 31. 
The 2021 ESPP became open for enrollment in April 2024. Under the 2021 ESPP, eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during each discrete 
six-month
 offering period. The purchase price under each discrete offering period is equal to 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Class A common stock on the first and last day of the offering period.
The first offering period was completed on October 31, 2024 and the Company issued 
26,773
 shares under the 2021 ESPP during the year ended December 31, 2024. A total of 
569,831
 shares of Class A common stock were reserved for future issuance under the 2021 ESPP as of December 31, 2024. In January 2025, the number of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2021 ESPP automatically increased by 
280,165

Future realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences and carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company performed an 
91
Table of Contents
evaluation to determine whether a valuation allowance was needed. Based on the Company’s analysis, which considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The valuation allowance increased by $
0.7
 million in 2024 and $
44.9
 million in 2023, primarily due to the increase in net operating loss carryforwards.
Under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Generally, an ownership change occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregated ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period (typically three years). Future changes in stock ownership, which may be outside of the Company’s control, may trigger an ownership change. In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have an equity component of the purchase price could result in an ownership change. If an ownership change has occurred or does occur in the future, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
As of December 31,
2024

Unrecognized tax benefits – January 1

To the extent penalties and interest would be assessed on any underpayment of income tax, the Company’s policy is that such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense in the financial statements. The Company had a nominal amount of accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company files income tax returns for U.S federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign countries. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending federal, state or foreign income tax examinations. As a result of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, the Company’s federal and state statutes of limitations remain open from 2016 and forward until the net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire prior to utilization.

Segment Reporting
The Company’s structure is aligned with how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews the business, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. At December 31, 2024, the Company has identified 
one
 reportable segment: GeneDx inclusive of Legacy GeneDx and Legacy Sema4 data revenues and associated costs. The GeneDx segment primarily provides pediatric and rare disease diagnostics with a focus on whole exome and genome sequencing and, to a lesser extent, data and information services. Other represents the revenues and costs associated with the Legacy Sema4 diagnostics business which was completely shut down in 2023.
The CODM evaluates segment performance based on revenue and adjusted gross profit.

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and oversight of the Board of Directors, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Previously Reported Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the preparation of the Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2023, we previously reported the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting:
•
Our accounting and operating systems lacked controls over access, and program change management that are needed to ensure access to financial data is adequately restricted to appropriate personnel, including consideration of the appropriate segregation of duties. As a result, it is possible that our business process controls that depend on the accuracy and completeness of data or financial reports generated by our information technology system could be adversely affected due to the lack of operating effectiveness of the information technology general controls (“ITGCs”).
Remediation of Previously-Reported Material Weakness
To remediate this material weakness, we completed the following actions:
•
We hired key personnel and expanded available resources with experience designing and implementing ITGCs, and through the use of outside consultants.
•
We performed a risk assessment over the IT systems used as part of financial reporting.
•
We rationalized user roles and permissions and established appropriate segregation of duties, where applicable.
•
We implemented process improvements and standardized certain practices across relevant systems, including access provisioning, deprovisioning and user access review processes.

Table of Contents
•
We conducted training for personnel responsible for internal control performers to deepen their comprehension of risk assessment concepts and to refine their execution of controls pertaining to financial reporting. 
•
We strengthened and documented our procedures around ITGCs and communicated them to relevant personnel.
Management believes it has effectively designed and tested the operating effectiveness related to the previously-reported material weakness noted above. Accordingly, management has concluded that the material weaknesses has been remediated because each component of the material weakness has been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Rule 10b5-1 Plan Adoptions and Modifications
On 
November 7, 2024
, a grantor annuity trust (the “GRAT”) of which 
Jason Ryan
, our 
chairman and a director
, is the trustee, 
entered into
 a written plan for the potential transfer of up to an aggregate of 
141,356
 shares of our Class A common stock (the “Ryan GRAT 10b5-1 Plan”). The Ryan GRAT 10b5-1 Plan is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act and will be effective from November 19, 2025 to 
March 5, 2027
.
The Ryan GRAT 10b5-1 plan included a representation from the GRAT to the broker administering the plan that the GRAT was not in possession of any material nonpublic information regarding the Company or the securities subject to the plan. A similar representation was made to us in a certification from Mr. Ryan provided to us in connection with the adoption of the applicable plan under our insider trading policy. Those representations were made as of the date of adoption of the Ryan GRAT 10b5-1 Plan or the certification, as applicable, and speak only as of those dates. In making those representations, there is no assurance with respect to any material non-public information of which the GRAT or Mr. Ryan was unaware, or with respect to any material non-public information acquired by the GRAT, Mr. Ryan or us after the applicable date of the representation.
Other than as disclosed above, during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, none of our directors or officers 
adopted
 or 
terminated
 any “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements,” as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K. 
Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections
