Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information
Our Class A common stock and public warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbols “WGS” and “WGSWW,” respectively.
Holders
As of February 14, 2025, there were 37 record holders of our Class A common stock and 5 record holders of our public warrants, based upon information received from our transfer agent. However, these numbers do not reflect beneficial owners whose shares were held of record by nominees or broker dealers. We believe a substantially greater number of beneficial owners hold shares of our Class A common stock or public warrants through brokers, banks, or other nominees. 
Dividend Policy
We have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We anticipate that we will retain earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of our credit agreement with Perceptive restrict us from paying cash dividends. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.
Sale of Unregistered Securities

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers
