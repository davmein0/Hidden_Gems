PART II
Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “POWI”.
As of January 31, 2025, there were approximately 61 stockholders of record. Because brokers and other institutions hold many of our shares on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
From time to time our board of directors has authorized the use of funds to repurchase shares of our common stock. In October 2024, our board of directors authorized the use 
of an additional $50.0 million for the repurchase of our common stock, with repurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines.
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $48.1 million available for future stock repurchases. Authorization of future repurchase programs is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors. There is no expiration date on the plan or the amount currently authorized.
The following table summarizes repurchases of our common stock made under our publicly announced repurchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024:

7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December

31,

 2023. The following discussion and analysis has been prepared as an aid to understanding our financial condition and results of our operations. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Overview
We design, develop and market analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (“ICs”) and other electronic components and circuitry used in high-voltage power conversion. Our products are used in power converters that convert electricity from a high-voltage source to the type of power required for a specified downstream use. In most cases, this conversion entails, among other functions, converting alternating current (“AC”) to direct current (“DC”) or vice versa, reducing or increasing the voltage, and regulating the output voltage and/or current according to the customer’s specifications.
A large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating our products are used with all manner of electronic products including mobile phones, computing and networking equipment, appliances, electronic utility meters, battery-powered tools, industrial controls, and “home-automation,” or “internet of things” applications such as networked thermostats, power strips and security devices. Variations of our power-supply ICs are used for high-voltage power conversion in electric vehicles (“EVs”). We also supply high-voltage LED drivers, which are AC-DC ICs specifically designed for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes, and motor-driver ICs for brushless DC (“BLDC”) motors used in consumer appliances, HVAC systems, ceiling fans and a variety of industrial applications. 
We also offer high-voltage gate drivers—either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical isolation components and other circuitry—used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”) and silicon-carbide (“SiC”) MOSFETs. These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power conversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts) such as industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, EVs and high-voltage DC transmission systems.
Our business and financial performance depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions. We face global macroeconomic challenges and risks including the effects of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, potential risks stemming from tensions between China and Taiwan and between China and Western countries, volatility in exchange rates, cyclical demand patterns common for our industry, inflation, tariffs and other risks associated with the global trade environment.
Our net revenues were $419.0 million and $444.5 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in revenues in 2024 was driven by lower sales into the communications end-market, primarily reflecting greater use of Chinese-made components in chargers manufactured for Chinese smartphone vendors, as well as increased decoupling of smartphone handsets and chargers. Revenues from the consumer, industrial and computer categories increased compared to the prior year.  
We believe that demand for our products has been negatively affected in recent years by an array of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including reduced consumer spending and a reduction in home sales in response to inflation and higher interest rates, general economic weakness in China, particularly in the residential real estate market, weaker industrial activity and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We believe these factors have exacerbated the effects of a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry; such downturns are commonly experienced following periods of strong growth­‒such as that observed during the COVID-19 pandemic‒during which supply-chain participants tend to accumulate excess inventories. Inventories at distributors of our products have decreased significantly in recent periods, enabling our sales to align more closely with end-market demand; this contributed to an increase in net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for approximately 79% and 80% of net revenues in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

International sales represented approximately 98% of net revenues for both 2024 and 2023.
Because our industry is intensely price-sensitive, our gross margin (gross profit divided by net revenues) is subject to change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours. Variations in product mix, end-market mix and customer mix can also cause our gross margin to fluctuate. Also, because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers from foundries located in Japan, our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. All else being equal, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Japanese yen would eventually result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately 1.4%; this sensitivity may increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply that we purchase from Japanese suppliers. Also, although our wafer fabrication and assembly operations are outsourced, as are most of our test operations, a portion of our production costs are fixed in nature. As a result, our unit costs and gross profit margin are impacted by the volume of units we produce.
Our gross profit, defined as net revenues less cost of revenues, was $224.8 million or 54% of net revenues in 2024, compared to $229.0 million or 52% of net revenues in 2023. Our gross margin increased in 2024 
due to 
the favorable impact of the dollar/yen exchange rate on our wafer costs, manufacturing efficiencies including the benefit of higher unit volumes on our manufacturing costs per unit,
 and favorable end-market mix
 with a greater percentage of sales coming from higher-margin market categories.
Total operating expenses in 2024 were $206.8

million, an increase of $12.9

million as compared to 2023, primarily due 
to increased stock-based compensation expense and higher salary- and benefit-related expenses driven by increased headcount, annual salary increases and higher costs associated with employee health insurance and other benefits.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those listed below. We base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Our critical accounting policies which reflect our more significant estimates are as follows:
*
revenue recognition;
*
inventory valuation.
Our critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. A brief description of our critical accounting policies and material estimates is set forth below. For more information regarding our accounting policies, see Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue recognition
Product revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors. We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and all related appropriate guidance. We recognize revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, we apply the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
Sales to most distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and limited rights of return (known as “stock rotation”) of our products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers. We recognize revenue from sales to distributors upon the transfer of control to the distributor. Frequently, distributors need to sell at a price lower than the standard distribution price in order to win business. At the time the distributor invoices its customer 
28

Table of Contents
or soon thereafter, the distributor submits a “ship-and-debit” price adjustment claim to us to adjust the distributor’s cost from the standard price to the pre-approved lower price. After we verify that the claim was pre-approved, we issue a credit memo to the distributor for the ship-and-debit claim. In determining the transaction price, we consider ship-and-debit price adjustments to be variable consideration. At the time revenue is recognized on sales to distributors, future ship-and-debit price adjustments are unknown and therefore subject to uncertainty. Such price adjustments are estimated using the expected-value method based on an analysis of actual ship-and-debit claims, at the distributor and product level, over a period of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. The reserve for ship-and-debit claims decreased by $9.6 million between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower inventory levels held by distributors. Historically, actual price adjustments for ship-and-debit claims have not materially differed from those estimated when determining the transaction price. To the extent future ship-and-debit claims significantly exceed amounts estimated, there could be a material impact on our revenues and results of operations. 
Stock rotation rights grant the distributor the ability to return certain specified amounts of inventory. Stock rotation returns are an additional form of variable consideration and are also estimated using the expected value method based on historical return rates. Historically, these distributor stock rotation returns have not been material. 
Inventory valuation
The bulk of our inventory is held in wafers, which combined with the fungibility of our products across customers and applications results in a lower risk of obsolescence. We routinely monitor the quality of our on-hand wafers to ensure that performance remains unchanged over time. 
When evaluating the adequacy of our provision for excess and obsolete inventory, we identify excess and obsolete products and also analyze historical usage, forecasted demand, current economic trends and historical write-offs
. 
This write-down is reflected as a reduction to inventory in the consolidated balance sheets and an increase in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of income. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions, we may be required to take additional write-downs, which could adversely impact our cost of revenues and operating results. Historically, these write-downs have not been material.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Net revenues. 
Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and allowances.

Revenues declined in 2024 compared to the prior year driven by lower sales into the communications end-market, primarily reflecting greater use of Chinese-made components in chargers manufactured for Chinese smartphone vendors, as well as increased decoupling of smartphone handsets and chargers. Revenues from the consumer, industrial and computer end-market categories increased compared to the prior year.

Sales to customers outside of the United States were $412.5 million and $435.9 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing 98% of net revenues in both 2024 and 2023. Although power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide, most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in Asia. As a result, sales to this region accounted for 84% of our net revenues in both 2024 and 2023. We expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future.
Sales to distributors accounted for 70% and 69% of our net revenues in 2024 and 2023, respectively, with direct sales to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers accounting for the remainder in each of the corresponding years.

Gross profit. 
Gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the purchase of wafers from our contracted foundries, the assembly, packaging and testing of our products by sub-contractors, product testing performed in our own facility, overhead associated with the management of our supply chain and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Gross margin is gross profit divided by net revenues. The following table compares gross profit and gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

In 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory U.S. federal income-tax rates of 21% due to the geographic distribution of our world-wide earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the impact of federal research tax credits and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Additionally, in 2024 and 2023, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a discrete item associated with the release of unrecognized tax benefits. These benefits were offset by U.S. tax on foreign income, known as global intangible low-taxed income. The primary jurisdiction from which our foreign earnings are derived is the Cayman Islands, which is a non-taxing jurisdiction. Income earned in other foreign jurisdictions was not material. We have not been granted any incentivized tax rates and do not operate under tax holidays in any jurisdiction. For additional details, refer to Note 11,

We have a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Credit Agreement") that provides us with a $75.0 million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a $20.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit. The Credit Agreement was amended on June 7, 2021, to provide an alternate borrowing rate as a replacement for LIBOR and extend the termination date from April 30, 2022 to June 7, 2026, with all other terms remaining the same. The Credit Agreement was amended with an effective date of June 28, 2023 to include the Secured Overnight Financing Rates (“SOFR”) as interest rate benchmark rates, with all other terms remaining the same. Our ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance with specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum liquidity measure and a debt to earnings ratio, with which we are currently in compliance. The Credit Agreement terminates on June 7, 2026; all advances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no advances outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
Cash from Operating Activities
Our operating activities generated cash of $81.2 million and $65.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generate cash primarily from operating activities in the ordinary course of business.
In 2024, our net income was $32.2 million, which included non-cash expenses of $33.3 million of depreciation, $35.1 million of stock-based compensation and $1.3 million of intangibles amortization partially offset by a $8.4 million increase in deferred income taxes. Sources of cash included a $3.5 million increase in accounts payable (excluding payables related to property and equipment) due to timing of payments and a $4.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets. These sources of cash were partially offset by a $12.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $2.4 million increase in inventories, and a $3.5 million decrease in taxes payable and accrued liabilities.

In 2023, our net income was $55.7 million, which included non-cash expenses of 
$35.2 million of depreciation, $28.5 million of stock-based compensation and $2.2 million of intangibles amortization partially offset by a $9.2 million increase in deferred income taxes. Sources of cash included a $6.6 million decrease in accounts receivable. These sources of cash were partially offset by a $27.7 million increase in inventories due to softening demand during the year, a $18.2 million decrease in taxes payable and accrued liabilities, a $5.4 million decrease in accounts payable (excluding payables related to property and equipment) due to timing of payments and a $1.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets
.
Cash from Investing Activities
Our investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted in a $25.9 million net use of cash, consisting primarily of $17.3 million for purchases of property and equipment and $9.5 million for the Odyssey acquisition, partially offset by $0.9 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases. 
Our investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in a $14.2 million net use of cash, consisting primarily of $20.9 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment, partially offset by $6.7 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases.
Cash from Financing Activities
Our financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024, resulted in a $68.2 million net use of cash. Financing activities consisted primarily of $46.0 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders and $27.9 million for the repurchase of our common stock, partially offset by proceeds of $5.7 million from the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan.
Our financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted in a $93.0 million net use of cash. Financing activities consisted primarily of $55.3 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $44.0 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $6.2 million from the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan.
Dividends
In February 2023, our board of directors declared dividends of $0.19 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2023. 
In October 2023, our board of directors raised the cash dividend with the declaration of five cash dividends of $0.20 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of the fourth quarter in 2023 (in lieu of the $0.19 per share announced in February 2023) and at the end of each quarter in 2024.
32

Table of Contents
In October 2024, our board of directors raised the cash dividend again with the declaration of five cash dividends of $0.21 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of the fourth quarter in 2024 (in lieu of the $0.20 per share announced in October 2023) and at the end of each quarter in 2025.
The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. 
Stock Repurchases
Over the years our board of directors has authorized the use of funds to repurchase shares of our common stock, including $100.0 million in October 2022 with repurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines. As of December 31, 2022, we had $81.3 million remaining under our stock-repurchase program.
In 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $55.3 million, leaving $26.0 million in funds authorized as of December 31, 2023. We exhausted this authorization in April 2024. In 
October 2024, our board of directors authorized the use of an additional $50.0 million for the repurchase of our common stock, with repurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines. As of December 31, 2024, $48.1 million remained under this repurchase authorization; the program has no expiration date. 
In 2024, 
we repurchased a total of 0.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock for $27.9 million. 
Authorization of future repurchase programs is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors.
Capital Expenditures
Cash paid for property and equipment in the year ended December 31, 2024 was $17.3 million. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to be primarily for machinery and equipment for use in the manufacture of our products to support future growth. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash on hand as well as cash provided by future operations. 
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Other Information
Our cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may change in future periods due to changes in our planned cash outlays, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to future acquisitions. Current U.S. tax laws generally allow companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, our worldwide cash and marketable securities are available to fund capital allocation needs, including capital and internal investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases and/or dividends without incurring significant U.S. federal income taxes.
If our operating results deteriorate in future periods, either as a result of a decrease in customer demand or pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors, or for other reasons, our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized. In that case, we may be forced to use our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, use our current financing or seek additional financing from third parties to fund our operations. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our uses of cash beyond the next 12 months will depend on many factors, including the general economic environment in which we operate and our ability to generate cash flow from operations, which are uncertain but include funding our operations and additional capital expenditures.

Operating lease obligations represent undiscounted non-cancelable remaining lease payments.
(2)
Purchase obligations represent commitments to our suppliers and other parties for the purchases of goods and services, which primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, and purchases of property and equipment.
In addition to operating lease and purchase obligations, we have a contractual obligation related to income tax as of December 31, 2024, which primarily comprises unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $15.2 million, and was classified as contra deferred tax assets or long-term income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy the cash requirements for these contractual obligations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Interest Rate Risk. 
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We consider cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term investments. We generally hold securities until maturity; however, they may be sold under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, when necessary for the funding of acquisitions and other strategic investments. As a result of this policy, we classify our investment portfolio as available-for-sale. We invest in high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our policy, we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high-credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to facilitate portfolio liquidity. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held primarily cash equivalents and short-term investments with fixed interest rates. We do not hold any instruments for trading purposes.
Our investment securities are subject to market interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate. To minimize market risk, we invest in high-credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, and therefore if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from interest rates as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023, the increase or decrease in the fair market value of our portfolio on these dates would not have been material. We monitor our investments for impairment on a periodic basis. Refer to Note 5, 
Marketable Securities
, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a tabular presentation of our available-for-sale investments and the expected maturity dates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. 
As of December 31, 2024, our primary transactional currency was the U.S. dollar; in addition, we hold cash in Swiss francs and euros to fund the operation of our Swiss subsidiary. Cash balances held in foreign countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the United States. The following represents the potential impact on our pretax income from a change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc and euro as of December 31, 2024. This sensitivity analysis applies a change in the U.S. dollar value of 5% and 10%.

The foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc and euro is recorded in other income in our consolidated statements of income.
We have R&D and sales offices in various other foreign countries in which our expenses are denominated in the local currency, primary Asia and Western Europe. From time to time we may enter into foreign currency hedging contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have an open foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
With two of our major suppliers, Seiko Epson Corporation (“Epson”) and ROHM Lapis Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (“Lapis”) we have wafer supply agreements based in U.S. dollars; however, our agreements with Epson and Lapis also allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar. Each year, our management and these suppliers review and negotiate pricing; the negotiated pricing is denominated in U.S. dollars but is subject to contractual exchange rate provisions. The fluctuation in the exchange rate is shared equally between us and each of these suppliers.
Nevertheless, as a result of our above-mentioned supplier agreements, our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. All else being equal, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Japanese yen would eventually result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately 1.4%; this sensitivity may increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply that we purchase from some of our Japanese suppliers and could subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Power Integrations, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Power Integrations, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 7, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Inventories – Provision for Excess and Obsolete Inventory – Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company's inventories are recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of net realizable value. The Company routinely evaluates quantities and values of inventories and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories to reduce its recorded inventory balance to its estimated net realizable value. Management’s assumptions regarding the inventory quantities considered to be excess and obsolete are determined by analyzing historical usage, demand forecasts, current economic trends, and historical write-offs. 
We identified the determination of excess and obsolete inventories within work-in-process and finished goods inventories as a critical audit matter due to the significant assumptions made by management when determining the excess and obsolete inventory quantities and the resulting provision. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent 
36

Table of Contents
of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s excess and obsolete provision for work-in-process and finished goods inventories.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s assumptions used in determining the excess and obsolete provision for work-in-process and finished goods inventories included the following, among others:
*
We tested the effectiveness of the control over the determination of the provision for excess and obsolete inventories, including work-in-process and finished goods inventories.
*
We selected a sample of products from work-in-process and finished goods inventories as of December 31, 2023, and evaluated management's ability to accurately estimate forecasted demand by comparing the respective products usage for the year ended December 31, 2024, to estimates made in the prior year. 
*
We selected a sample of products from work-in-process and finished goods inventories and evaluated the reasonableness of management's provision for work-in-process and finished goods inventories by considering recent usage, historical usage, contracts and communications with customers, expected product lifecycles, macroeconomic conditions, and inquiries with sales personnel.
*
We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal communications to management and the board of directors, Company press releases, and analyst reports, as well as our observations and inquiries as to changes within the business.

POWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. THE COMPANY:
Power Integrations, Inc. (“Power Integrations” or the “Company”), incorporated in California on March 25, 1988, and reincorporated in Delaware in December 1997, designs, develops, manufactures and markets analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (“ICs”) and other electronic components and circuitry used in high-voltage power conversion. The Company’s products are used in power converters that convert electricity from a high-voltage source to the type of power required for a specified downstream use. 
In most cases, this conversion entails, among other functions, converting alternating current (“AC”) to direct current (“DC”) or vice versa, reducing or increasing the voltage, and regulating the output voltage and/or current according to the customer’s specifications.
​
A large percentage of the Company’s products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating the Company’s products are used with all manner of electronic products including mobile phones, computing and networking equipment, appliances, electronic utility meters, battery-powered tools, industrial controls, and “home-automation,” or “internet of things” applications such as networked thermostats, power strips and other building-automation and security devices. The Company also supplies high-voltage LED drivers, which are AC-DC ICs specifically designed for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes, and motor-drivers ICs for brushless DC (“BLDC”) motors used in consumer appliances, HVAC systems, ceiling fans and a variety of industrial applications. The Company also offers high-voltage gate drivers—either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical isolation components and other circuitry—used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”) and silicon-carbide (“SiC”) MOSFETs. These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power conversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts) such as industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, electric vehicles and high-voltage DC transmission systems.
​
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates
Segment Reporting
The Company is organized and operates as 
one
 reportable segment, the design, development, manufacture and marketing of integrated circuits and related components for use primarily in high-voltage power conversion. The Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany transactions and balances.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for receivables, inventories, litigation and income taxes. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other factors, which the Company believes to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made. However, as the effects of future events cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from management’s estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606-10, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, and all related appropriate guidance. The Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, 
43

Table of Contents
(4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
Product revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors. The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with a customer. In situations where sales are to a distributor, the Company has concluded that its contracts are with the distributor as the Company holds a contract bearing enforceable rights and obligations only with the distributor. As part of its consideration of the contract, the Company evaluates certain factors including the customer’s ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on their relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment. Further, in determining whether control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, along with risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer.
Frequently, the Company receives orders for products to be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across several reporting periods. The Company invoices for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues for each distinct product delivered, assuming transfer of control has occurred. As scheduled delivery dates are within one year, under the optional exemption provided by ASC 606-10-50-14 revenues allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed. The Company has also elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year.
Sales to international customers that are shipped from the Company’s facility outside of the United States are pursuant to EX Works, or EXW, shipping terms, meaning that control of the product transfers to the customer upon shipment from the Company’s foreign warehouse. Sales to international customers that are shipped from the Company’s facility in California are pursuant to Delivered at Frontier, or DAF, shipping terms. As such, control of the product passes to the customer when the shipment reaches the destination country and revenue is recognized upon the arrival of the product in that country. Shipments to customers in the Americas are pursuant to Free on Board, or FOB, point of origin shipping terms meaning that control is passed to the customer upon shipment.
Sales to most distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and limited rights of return (known as “stock rotation”) of the Company’s products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon the transfer of control to the distributor. Frequently, distributors need to sell at a price lower than the standard distribution price in order to win business. At the time the distributor invoices its customer or soon thereafter, the distributor submits a “ship-and-debit” price adjustment claim to the Company to adjust the distributor’s cost from the standard price to the pre-approved lower price. After the Company verifies that the claim was pre-approved, a credit memo is issued to the distributor for the ship-and-debit claim. In determining the transaction price, the Company considers ship-and-debit price adjustments to be variable consideration. Such price adjustments are estimated using the expected value method based on an analysis of actual ship-and-debit claims, at the distributor and product level, over a period of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. Historically, actual price adjustments for ship-and-debit claims have not materially differed from those estimated and included when determining the transaction price. Stock rotation rights grant the distributor the ability to return certain specified amounts of inventory. Stock rotation adjustments are an additional form of variable consideration and are also estimated using the expected value method based on historical return rates. Historically, distributor stock rotation adjustments have not been material.
Sales to certain distributors are made under terms that do not include rights of return or price concessions after the product is shipped to the distributor. Accordingly, upon application of steps one through five above, product revenue is recognized upon shipment and transfer of control.
The Company generally provides an assurance warranty that its products will substantially conform to the published specifications for twelve months from the date of shipment. The Company’s liability is limited to either a credit equal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective part. Returns under warranty have historically been immaterial. As such, the Company does not record a specific warranty reserve or consider activities related to such warranty, if any, to be a separate performance obligation.

Table of Contents
Inventories
Inventories (which consist of costs associated with the purchases of wafers from domestic and offshore foundries and of packaged components from offshore assembly manufacturers, as well as internal labor and overhead associated with the testing of both wafers and packaged components).
Inventory is recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of net realizable value. The Company routinely evaluates quantities and values of inventories and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories to reduce its recorded inventory balance to its estimated net realizable value. In order to determine the provision management considers historical usage, forecasted demand, current economic trends and historical write-offs.
Income Taxes
Income-tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry-forwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes.
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740, 
Income Taxe
s. Under the provisions of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, utilizing the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company limits the deferred tax assets recognized related to certain officers’ compensation to amounts that it estimates will be deductible in future periods based upon Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). The Company also recognizes valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets to the amount that it estimates will more likely than not be realized based on available evidence and management’s judgment. In the event that the Company determines, based on available evidence and management judgment, that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, it would record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.
The U.S. tax rules require U.S. tax on foreign earnings, known as global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”). Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions as a current-period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (the “deferred method”).  We selected the deferred method of accounting and recorded the associated basis differences anticipated to influence prospective income inclusion calculations.  
Business Combinations
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
 (“ASC 805”), in accounting for acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that the Company evaluates whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires the Company to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, the Company may record certain adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Upon the 
conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. All acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

Table of Contents
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and the Company’s domain name are evaluated in accordance with ASC 350-10, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, 
and an impairment analysis is conducted on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators exist for a potential impairment.
In accordance with ASC 360-10, 
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
, long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities
The Company generally holds securities until maturity; however, they may be sold under certain circumstances including, but not limited to, when necessary for the funding of acquisitions and other strategic investments. As a result, the Company classifies its investment portfolio as available-for-sale. The Company classifies all investments with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase as short-term marketable securities in its consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper, corporate bonds, government securities and/or other high-quality commercial securities.
Employee Benefits Plan
The Company sponsors a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan for all employees in the United States who meet certain eligibility requirements. Participants may contribute up to the amount allowable as a deduction for federal income tax purposes. The Company is not required to contribute; however, the Company contributes a certain percentage of employee annual salaries on a discretionary basis, not to exceed an established threshold. The Company provided for a contribution of approximately $
2.1
 million, $
2.1
 million and $
2.0
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Retirement Benefit Obligations (Pension)
The Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit pension or post-retirement plan as an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity, and are amortized as a component of net periodic cost over the remaining estimated service period of participants.
Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Currency Translation
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s primary transactional currency was U.S. dollars; in addition, the Company holds cash in Swiss francs and euros to fund the operations of the Company’s Swiss subsidiary. The foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc and euro is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of income.
Gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of non-functional currency balances are recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company recognized a loss of $
0.3
 million in 2024, a loss of $

Warranty
The Company generally warrants that its products will substantially conform to the published specifications for 
12 months
 from the date of shipment. The Company’s liability is limited to either a credit equal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective part. Returns under warranty have historically been immaterial, and as a result, the Company does not record a specific warranty reserve.
Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $
1.5
 million, $
1.3
 million and $
1.4
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Indemnifications
The Company sells products to its distributors under contracts, collectively referred to as Distributor Sales Agreements (“DSA”). Each DSA contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the distributor, and generally includes certain provisions for indemnifying the distributor against losses, expenses, and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the distributor in the event the Company’s products are found to infringe upon a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party (Customer Indemnification). The DSA generally limits the scope of and remedies for the Customer Indemnification obligations in a variety of industry-standard respects, including, but not limited to, limitations based on time and geography, and a right to replace an infringing product. The Company also, from time to time, has granted a specific indemnification right to individual customers.
The Company believes its internal development processes and other policies and practices limit its exposure related to such indemnifications. In addition, the Company requires its employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions agreement, which assigns the rights to its employees’ development work to the Company. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse any of its distributors or customers for any losses related to these indemnifications and no material claims were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases, the Company cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnifications.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements and expand public entities’ segment disclosures in the annual and interim financial statements. The amendment requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. All disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are required for entities with a single reportable segment. The Company adopted the new standard in fiscal year 2024 for annual and retrospective reporting periods with all interim disclosures to begin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Refer to Note 13. 
Segment Reporting
.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-09”), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company does not expect the amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
 (
Subtopic 220-40) 
which requires additional disclosure of certain costs and expenses, including inventory purchases, employee compensation, selling expense and depreciation expense within the notes to financial statements. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:
ASC 820-10, 
Fair Value Measurements
, clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.
The Company’s cash equivalents and investment instruments are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The type of instrument valued based on quoted market prices in active markets primarily includes money market securities. This type of instrument is generally classified within Level 1 of the fair-value hierarchy. The types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs (Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy) include investment-grade corporate bonds and commercial paper. Such types of investments are valued by using a multi-dimensional relational model, the inputs are primarily benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research

The 
$
3.4
 million of goodwill acquired in 2024, resulted from the purchase of Odyssey (see Note 15, 
Acquisition
, for further details).
Intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology, in-process research and development, acquired licenses and domain name, and are reported net of accumulated amortization. In July 2024, the Company 
acquired the assets of Odyssey, a U.S. company and developer of vertical gallium-nitride (“GaN”) transistor technology, resulting in the addition of in-process research and development of 
$
4.9
 million. 
The Company amortizes the cost of all intangible assets over the estimated useful life of the developed technology and technology licenses, which range from 
two
 to 
twelve years
, with the exception of $

7. STOCK PLANS AND SHARE BASED COMPENSATION:
Stock Plans
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
three
 stock-based compensation plans (the “Plans”) which are described below.
2007 Equity Incentive Plan
The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (“2007 Plan”) was adopted by the board of directors on September 10, 2007, and approved by the stockholders on November 7, 2007, as an amendment and restatement of the 1997 Stock Option Plan (“1997 Plan”). The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards, stock appreciation rights, performance-based (“PSU”) awards, long-term performance based (“PRSU”) awards and other stock awards to employees, directors and consultants. The 2007 Plan expired in September 2017 with no further grants to be made under this plan; however previous grants under this plan shall remain outstanding until they are exercised, vest, forfeited or expire.
2016 Incentive Award Plan
The 2016 Incentive Award Plan (“2016 Plan”) was adopted by the board of directors on March 17, 2016 and approved by the stockholders on May 13, 2016. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of RSU awards, PSU awards and PRSU awards. No other forms of equity-based awards, including stock options and stock appreciation rights, may be granted under the 2016 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 
3.9
 million awards have been issued, net of forfeitures or cancellations, and approximately 
3.1
 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2016 Plan.
1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“Purchase Plan”), eligible employees may apply accumulated payroll deductions, which may not exceed 
15
% of an employee’s compensation, to the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock at periodic intervals. The purchase price of stock under the Purchase Plan is equal to 
85
% of the lower of (i) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day of each offering period, or (ii) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the purchase date (as defined in the Purchase Plan). Each offering period consists of 
one
 purchase period of approximately 
six months
 duration. An aggregate of 
7.5
 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to employees under the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2024, of the shares reserved for issuance, 
6.9
 million shares had been purchased and 
0.6
 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.
Shares Reserved
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 
3.9
 million shares of common stock reserved for future grant under all stock plans.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 718-10, 
Stock Compensation
. Under the provisions of ASC 718-10, the Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation in its financial statements over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals a 
four-year
 vesting period. The Company uses estimates of volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and forfeitures in determining the fair value of these awards and the amount of compensation expense to recognize. The Company uses the straight-line method to amortize all stock awards granted over the requisite service period of the award.
The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense recognized in accordance with ASC 718-10 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

PSU Awards
Under the performance-based awards program, the Company grants awards in the performance year in an amount equal to twice the target number of shares to be issued if the maximum performance metrics are met. The number of shares that are released at the end of the performance year can range from 
zero
 to 
200
% of the target number depending on the Company’s performance. The performance metrics of this program are annual targets consisting of a combination of net revenue, non-GAAP operating earnings and strategic goals.
As the net revenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals are considered performance conditions, expense associated with these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the achievement of the performance targets. The fair value of these PSUs is determined using the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the discounted present value of dividends expected to be declared before the awards vest. If the performance conditions are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation is reversed.

In February 2024, it was determined that approximately 
38,000
 shares subject to the PSUs granted in 2023 vested in aggregate; the shares were released to the Company’s employees and executives in the first quarter of 2024. The grant-date fair value of PSU awards released, which were fully vested, in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was approximately $
3.2
 million, $
2.7
 million and $
8.8
 million, respectively.
PRSU Awards (Long-term Performance Based)
The Company’s PRSU program provides for the issuance of PRSUs which will vest based on the Company’s performance measured against the PRSU program’s established performance targets. PRSUs are granted in an amount equal to twice the target number of shares to be issued if the maximum performance metrics are met. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of a 
three-year
 performance period based on results achieved versus the Company’s performance goals, and may range from 
zero
 to 
200
% of the target number. The performance goals for PRSUs granted in fiscal 2022, 2023 and 2024 were based on the Company’s compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of revenue as measured against the revenue CAGR of the analog semiconductor industry (“Relative Measure”), in each case over the respective 
three-year
 performance period. In addition, the PRSUs granted in 2023 (“2023 PRSUs”) and 2024 (“2024 PRSUs”) also include a performance goal related to the Company’s revenue growth over the respective 
three-year
 performance period as compared to defined targets (“Absolute Measure”) with the actual vesting of the 2023 PRSUs and 2024 PRSUs calculated based on higher achievement under the Relative Measure or the Absolute Measure. 
Expense associated with these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded throughout the year based on an assessment of the expected achievement of the performance targets. If the performance conditions are not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation is reversed.

In February 2024 it was determined that 
no
 shares subject to the PRSUs granted in 2021 vested; thus no shares were released to the Company’s executives in the first quarter of 2024. 
The grant-date fair value of PRSU awards released, which were fully vested, in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was approximately $
1.1
 million and $
4.6
 million
, 
respectively.
RSU Awards
RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a 
four-year
 period and are converted into shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis subject to the employee’s continued service to the Company over that period. The fair value of RSUs is determined using the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant, reduced by the discounted present value of dividends expected to be declared before the awards vest. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each grant adjusted for estimated forfeitures.

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE:
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares of common stock and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent shares included in this calculation consist of dilutive shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of outstanding common stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, the assumed issuance of awards under the stock purchase plan and contingently issuable performance-based awards, as computed using the treasury stock method.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. Under the provisions of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, utilizing the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

The Company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the geographic distribution of the Company’s world-wide earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions, federal research tax credits and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments. The rate was further reduced by the release of federal uncertain tax positions caused by an expiration in the statute of limitations on these positions. These benefits were partially offset by foreign income subject to U.S. tax, known as global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). The Company’s primary jurisdiction where foreign earnings are derived is the Cayman Islands, which is a non-taxing jurisdiction. Income earned in other foreign jurisdictions was not material. The Company has not been granted any incentivized tax rates and does not operate under any tax holidays in any jurisdiction.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income. In the event that the Company determines, based on available evidence and management judgment, that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the Company would record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s expectations could have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance primarily as a result of its California, New Jersey and Canada deferred tax assets as the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had utilized all of its federal research and development tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had California research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
42.0
 million (there is no expiration of research and development tax credit carry-forwards for the state of California) and California net operating losses of $
44.2
 million which will begin to expire in 
2032
. As of 
60

Table of Contents
December 31, 2024, the Company had Canadian scientific research and experimental development tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $
3.8
 million and New Jersey research and experimental development tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $
1.0
 million, which will start to expire in 
2030
 and 
2026
, respectively.
Current U.S. tax laws generally allow companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes although local foreign and U.S. states taxes may still be incurred upon repatriation. The Company has not provided for U.S. taxes on its undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The determination of the future tax consequences of the remittance of these earnings is not practicable.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits

3.8
 million, net of valuation allowance adjustments, would be recorded if fiscal year 2024 unrecognized tax benefits are recognized. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that could be adjusted in the next twelve months.
The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $
0.3
 million in both December 31, 2024 and 2023, which have been recorded in long-term income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s tax returns continue to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years after 2021. The California Franchise Tax Board is conducting an audit for the tax years 2018 and 2019, it is still currently ongoing.

Initial lease terms are determined at commencement and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. Remaining lease terms range from 
one
 to 
nine years
, some of which include options to extend for up to 
six years
, and some of which include options to terminate within 
one year
. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the present value of future lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date.

13. SEGMENT REPORTING:
The Company is organized and operates as 
one

operating
 and reportable segment; the design, development, manufacture and marketing of integrated circuits and related components for use primarily in high-voltage power conversion. This determination is based on the management approach which designates internal information regularly available to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of determination of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company’s CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purpose of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. 
The CODM uses net income as the measure of profit or loss to allocate resources and assess performance. The CODM regularly reviews net income as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Financial forecasts and budget to actual results used by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources, as well as those used for 
62

Table of Contents
strategic decisions related to headcount and capital expenditures are also reviewed on a consolidated basis. The CODM considers the impact of the significant segment expenses in the table below on net income when deciding whether to reinvest profits, propose dividends or share repurchase, or pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. 
The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets. The CODM does not review segment assets at a level other than that presented in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

14. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES:
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits, or customers and distributors may make claims against the Company. In accordance with ASC 450 10, Contingencies, the Company makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
On December 18, 2019, CogniPower LLC (“CogniPower”) filed a complaint against a customer of the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of 
two
 patents; the Company thereafter intervened and sought a declaration of non-infringement with respect to use of the Company’s products. The case was then stayed until February 26, 2024, when the Delaware Court then set a schedule for the remainder of the case, with further proceedings in the coming months, and a trial scheduled in August 2025. The Company believes it has strong claims and defenses with respect to all of CogniPower’s asserted patents and intends to vigorously defend itself against CogniPower’s claims against the Company’s technology, with appeals to follow if necessary.
On October 31, 2022, Waverly Licensing LLC (“Waverly”) filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. In its complaint, Waverly alleged that the Company was infringing 
one
 patent pertaining to charging a battery-operated device.  Because the Company believed that Waverly’s Texas complaint was improperly filed in the wrong court, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, and on November 30, 2022, the Company filed a complaint against Waverly and related entities, IP Edge LLC, Mavexar LLC, and Array IP LLC, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a declaration of non-infringement with respect to a patent that Waverly charged the Company with infringing. The Texas court thereafter dismissed Waverly’s Texas complaint. On March 12, 2024, the Delaware Court dismissed the Delaware case in view of a series of covenants not to sue that Waverly et al. filed with the Court.  
The Company is unable to predict the outcome of legal proceedings with certainty, and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in the above-mentioned unsettled litigations. These litigations, whether or not determined in the Company’s favor or settled, will be costly and will divert the efforts and attention of the Company’s management

and technical personnel from normal business operations, potentially causing a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results. Currently, the Company is not able to estimate a loss or a range of loss for the ongoing litigations disclosed above, however adverse determinations in litigation could result in monetary losses, the loss of proprietary rights, subject the Company to significant liabilities, require the Company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the Company from licensing the technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.
15. ACQUISITION:

Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies
On March 12, 2024, the Company 
agreed to acquire the assets of Odyssey, a U.S. company and a developer of vertical gallium-nitride (“GaN”) transistor technology. The transaction closed on July 1, 2024, at which time all key Odyssey employees joined the Company. P
ursuant to the asset purchase agreement, Odyssey sold, transferred and assigned substantially all of its assets to the Company for

$
9.52
 million in cash. 
The purchase is 
intended to augment the Company’s development of high-power GaN switching technology.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase consideration of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill, the amount of which represents the expected benefits to the Company of future technology and the knowledgeable and experienced employees who joined the Company. Goodwill is expected to be deductible over 
15 years
 for tax purposes.
The following table summarizes the purchase price and estimated fair values of the assets acquired as of July 1, 2024, the completion of the Odyssey acquisition:

​
​

Total purchase price
​
$

​
The fair value of in-process research and development was determined based on the cost approach using the Company’s estimate of the costs that would be incurred if a market participant were to create the acquired technology from scratch. The Company considered the number of engineers required, salaries and related benefits, allocated overhead and the development time required to recreate the technology. The Company will record the in-process research and development as an intangible asset with an indefinite life until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts, and will begin amortizing the value over the estimated life of the technology upon completion of development. Consistent with the treatment of other intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company will test the in-process research and development for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators are present. 
Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because they are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
​
16. RETIREMENT PLANS:
The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) for its Swiss subsidiary in accordance with the legal requirements of Switzerland. The plan assets, which provide benefits in the event of an employee’s retirement, death or disability, are held in legally autonomous trustee-administered funds that are subject to Swiss law. Benefits are based on the employee’s age, years of service and salary, and the plan is financed by contributions by both the employee and the Company.
The net periodic benefit cost of the Pension Plan was not material to the Company’s financial statements during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2024, the projected benefit obligation was $
18.3
 million, the plan assets were $
11.4
 million and the net pension liability was $
6.9
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligation was $
11.4
 million, the plan assets were $
7.9
 million, and the net pension liability was $
3.5
 million. The Company has recorded the unfunded amount as a liability in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023, under the other liabilities caption. The Company expects to make contributions to the Pension Plan of approximately $
0.5
 million during 2025. The accumulated unrealized actuarial balance on pension

benefits, net of tax, at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
1.5
 million loss, $
1.6
 million gain and $
0.9
 million gain, respectively. These amounts were reflected in Note 3 under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss.
In accordance with the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic of ASC 715-20, 
Defined Benefits Plan
, the Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of its defined post-retirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. The Company measured the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year-end.
​
17. BANK LINE OF CREDIT:
On July 27, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Credit Agreement") that provides the Company with a $
75.0
 million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a $
20.0
 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit. The Credit Agreement was amended on April 30, 2018, to extend the termination date from July 26, 2019, to April 30, 2022, with all other terms remaining the same. The Credit Agreement was amended on June 7, 2021, to provide an alternate borrowing rate as a replacement for LIBOR and extend the termination date from April 30, 2022, to June 7, 2026, with all other terms remaining the same. The Credit Agreement was amended with an effective date of June 28, 2023 to include the Secured Overnight Financing Rates (“SOFR”) as interest rate benchmark rates, with all other terms remaining the same. 
The Company’s ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon the Company’s compliance with specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum cash requirement and a debt to earnings ratio. The Credit Agreement terminates on June 7, 2026; all advances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. The Company was compliant with all covenants and had 
no
 advances outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
Schedule II
Valuation and Qualifying Accounts
The Company maintains an allowance for the distributors’ ship-and-debit credits relating to the sell-through of the Company’s products. This reserve is established using the Company’s historical ship-and-debit amounts and levels of inventory in the distributor channels.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
Not applicable.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management is required to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting, which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. To the extent that components of our internal control over financial reporting are included within our disclosure controls and procedures, they are included in the scope of our periodic controls evaluation. Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
●
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
●
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
●
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
Management conducted an assessment of Power Integrations’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
issued in 2013. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of Power Integrations’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP (PCAOB ID No.
 34
), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Power Integrations, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Power Integrations, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 7, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Appointment of New Director
On February 3, 2025, the

Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Power Integrations, Inc. appointed Gregg Lowe to serve as a director beginning on February 15, 2025. Mr. Lowe’s appointment was recommended to the Board by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board.
Mr. Lowe was the president and chief executive officer of Wolfspeed, Inc., the leader in silicon carbide solutions for high power applications, from September 2017 until November 2024. Mr. Lowe previously served as president and chief executive officer of Freescale Semiconductor from June 2012 until its merger with NXP in 2015. Prior, Mr. Lowe served as senior vice president and manager of the analog business for Texas Instruments where he helped to direct the acquisition of National Semiconductor. During his 27 years at Texas Instruments, Mr. Lowe served in a succession of roles including various leadership positions across field sales, automotive sales, marketing and integrated circuits where he oversaw a global team with design centers and customers across the globe. Mr. Lowe currently serves on the boards of Silicon Laboratories, Inc., The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Museum and North Carolina A&T University. Mr. Lowe has a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana and is a graduate from the Stanford Executive Program at Stanford University. 
Upon commencement of services to the Board, and in consideration of services to us as a director, Mr. Lowe will be granted an equity award in the form of restricted stock units of our common stock (the "Initial Grant") under the Power Integrations 2016 Incentive Award Plan (the “2016

Plan”) with an aggregate fair value of approximately

$45,000. The Initial Grant will vest on the date of our 2025

annual meeting of stockholders (currently scheduled for May

15,

2025), provided Mr. Lowe is still serving as a director on that date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Initial Grant would be deemed fully vested upon the occurrence of a "Change of Control," as such term is defined in the 2016

Plan. Beginning on July

1,

2025, Mr. Lowe will receive annual equity compensation pursuant to the Directors Equity Compensation Program consistent with our other non-employee directors, which is a grant of restricted stock units, under the 2016 Plan, with an aggregate value of $200,000, which would vest in full effective immediately prior to the commencement of our first annual meeting of stockholders in the year following the year of the grant date, provided that he is still providing services to the Company as a director and provided, further, that 100% of the shares subject to such equity award would be deemed fully vested upon the occurrence of a Change of Control.
As a non-employee director, Mr. Lowe will also receive $11,250 per quarter for service on the Board, prorated for his start date of service until June 30, 2025. Starting July 1, 2025, the amount will increase to $15,000 per quarter.  We intend to enter into an indemnity agreement with Mr. Lowe that is in the form of indemnity agreements executed by other members of the Board.
