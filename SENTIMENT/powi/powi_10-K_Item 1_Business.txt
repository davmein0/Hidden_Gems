Item 1. Business.
Overview
We design, develop and market analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits (“ICs”) and other electronic components and circuitry used in high-voltage power conversion. Our products are used in power converters that convert electricity from a high-voltage source to the type of power required for a specified downstream use. In most cases, this conversion entails, among other functions, converting alternating current (“AC”) to direct current (“DC”) or vice versa, reducing or increasing the voltage, and regulating the output voltage and/or current according to the customer’s specifications.
A large percentage of our products are ICs used in AC-DC power supplies, which convert the high-voltage AC from a wall outlet to the low-voltage DC required by most electronic devices. Power supplies incorporating our products are used with all manner of electronic products including appliances, industrial controls, mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and notebook computers, electronic utility meters, battery-powered tools, and “home-automation,” or “internet of things” applications such as networked thermostats, power strips and security devices. Variations of our power-supply ICs are used for high-voltage power conversion in electric vehicles (“EVs”). We also supply high-voltage LED drivers, which are AC-DC ICs specifically designed for lighting applications that utilize light-emitting diodes, and motor-driver ICs for brushless DC (“BLDC”) motors used in consumer appliances, HVAC systems, ceiling fans and a variety of industrial applications.
We also offer high-voltage gate drivers—either standalone ICs or circuit boards containing ICs, electrical isolation components and other circuitry—used to operate high-voltage switches such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”) and silicon-carbide (“SiC”) MOSFETs. These combinations of switches and drivers are used for power conversion in high-power applications (i.e., power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts) such as industrial motors, solar- and wind-power systems, electric locomotives, EVs and high-voltage DC transmission systems.
Our power-conversion products are distinguished by their “system-level” nature; that is, they incorporate into a single product numerous elements of a power-conversion system including a high-voltage transistor, drivers, advanced control circuitry and, in some cases, a communication link connecting the primary (i.e., input) and secondary (i.e., output) sides of the power converter while maintaining safety isolation to protect the end user from exposure to high voltage. Alternatively, a power converter can be designed and assembled using discrete components purchased from a variety of suppliers.
Our system-level products offer a number of important benefits compared with discrete designs, including: reduced design complexity; smaller size; lower component count, which in turn results in higher reliability and easier sourcing of components; reduced time-to-market; and more efficient use of engineering resources. Our products also reduce the energy consumption of power converters during normal use and in “standby” operation, when the end product is not in use. In addition to the environmental and economic benefits of reduced energy usage, our energy-saving technologies provide a number of benefits to our customers; these include helping them meet the increasingly stringent efficiency standards now in effect for many electronic products, and enabling the elimination of bulky, costly heatsinks used to dissipate the heat produced by wasted electricity. By reducing component count, circuit-board size and the need for heatsinks, our products also contribute to a reduction in materials usage and electronic waste.
While the size of our addressable market fluctuates with changes in macroeconomic and industry conditions, the market has generally exhibited a modest growth rate over time as growth in the unit volume of power converters has been offset to a large degree by reductions in the average selling price of components in this market. Therefore, the growth of our business depends largely on increasing our penetration of the markets that we serve and on further expanding our addressable market. Our growth strategy includes the following elements:
●
Increase the size of our addressable market.
 Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC applications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion. Since then, we have expanded our SAM to approximately $4 billion through a variety of means. These include the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power AC-DC applications (such as our Hiper™ product families), the introduction of LED-driver products, and our entry into the gate-driver market In 2018 we introduced our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs for BLDC motors, and in 2024 we introduced BridgeSwitch-2, extending the addressable power range of our motor-driver products up to about one horsepower. We have recently introduced a range of products targeting the EV market; we plan to introduce additional products for EVs in the future, and expect automotive applications to become a

significant portion of our SAM over time.

Also contributing to our SAM expansion has been the emergence of new applications within the power ranges that our products can address. For example, applications such as “smart” utility meters, battery-powered lawn equipment and bicycles, and USB power receptacles (often installed alongside traditional AC wall outlets) can incorporate our products. The increased use of connectivity, LED lighting and other power-consuming electronic features in consumer appliances has also enhanced our SAM.
We have also expanded our SAM through the development of technologies and architectures that increase the value (and therefore the average selling prices) of our products. For example, our InnoSwitch™ ICs integrate circuitry from the secondary, or low-voltage, side of AC-DC power supplies, whereas earlier product families integrated circuitry only on the primary, or high-voltage side. Our InnoMux™ IC families provide up to three DC outputs, eliminating the need for additional power-management circuitry in certain end products requiring multiple voltages while significantly increasing efficiency. 
●
Increase our penetration of the markets we serve.
 We currently address AC-DC applications with power outputs up to approximately 500 watts, gate-driver applications 
ranging from 100 kilowatts up to gigawatts,
 and motor-drive applications up to approximately one horsepower. Through our research and development efforts, we seek to introduce more advanced products for these markets offering higher levels of integration and performance compared to earlier products. We also continue to expand our sales and application-engineering staff and our network of distributors, as well as our offerings of technical documentation and design-support tools and services to help customers use our products. These tools and services include our PI Expert™ design software, which we offer free of charge, and our transformer-sample service. In 2022 we

launched 
PowerPros
℠
, a live online video support service that enables power-supply designers to talk directly with members of our applications engineering team 24 hours a day, six days a week, anywhere in the world.

Leverage the performance benefits of our proprietary gallium-nitride (“GaN”) technology. 
In 2019 we began incorporating our proprietary 
PowiGaN
™
 gallium-nitride
 transistors in some of our products, enabling a higher level of energy efficiency than ICs with silicon transistors. Since then, we have introduced a variety of new products utilizing GaN technology, and developed new generations of our GaN technology capable of supporting voltages as high as 1700 volts. While high-voltage GaN transistors have historically been more costly to produce than comparable silicon transistors, we have achieved cost reductions such that our GaN devices are approaching cost parity with silicon MOSFETs. 
We are developing additional products incorporating GaN transistors, which we believe will enable us to address higher-power applications than we address with our current range of products, and further expand our SAM as discussed above. We expect such applications to include power supplies used in  data centers delivering artificial intelligence (AI) services, in communications network infrastructure equipment and in onboard-charging circuitry for EVs, among others. 
Additionally, we are developing GaN technologies capable of supporting higher power output than today’s GaN devices, with an aim of developing products to address power-switching modules in EV drivetrains, which currently incorporate SiC and IGBT modules. In July 2024 we acquired the assets of Odyssey Semiconductor, a developer of so-called vertical GaN technology, in an effort to accelerate our development of higher-power GaN devices. We believe the development of such technologies will take several years to complete.

Capitalize on efforts to reduce carbon emissions by providing products that contribute to improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy.
 In its 2019 World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency estimated that more than two-thirds of the reduction in carbon-dioxide (“CO2”) emissions needed to achieve the “Sustainable Development Scenario” of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda is to come from improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy. Energy savings enabled by our products help our customers comply with regulations that seek to curb energy consumption in support of reducing CO2 emissions. For example: our EcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the amount of energy consumed by electronic products when they are plugged in but not in use; our PowiGaN™ gallium-nitride (“GaN”) transistors reduce energy consumption compared to silicon transistors; and our BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver ICs provide highly efficient power conversion for BLDC motors in appliances and industrial applications. Also, our gate-driver products are critical components in energy-efficient DC motor drives, solar- and wind-power systems, efficient high-voltage DC transmission systems (including transmission of energy from

renewable energy installations to the power grid), and low-emissions transportation applications such as electric locomotives.
Industry Background
Virtually every electronic device that plugs into a wall socket requires a power supply to convert the high-voltage alternating current provided by electric utilities into the low-voltage direct current required by most electronic devices. A power supply may be located inside a device, such as a consumer appliance or flat-panel TV, or it may be outside the device as in the case of a mobile-phone charger or an adapter for a cordless phone or cable modem.
Until approximately 1970, AC-DC power supplies were generally in the form of line-frequency, or linear, transformers. These devices, consisting primarily of copper wire wound around an iron core, tend to be bulky and heavy, and typically waste a substantial amount of electricity. In the 1970s, the availability of high-voltage discrete semiconductors enabled the development of a new generation of power supplies known as switched-mode power supplies, or switchers. These switchers generally came to be cost-effective alternatives to linear transformers in applications requiring more than a few watts of power; in recent years the use of linear transformers has declined even further as a result of energy-efficiency standards and higher raw-material prices.
Switchers are generally smaller, lighter-weight and more energy-efficient than linear transformers. However, switchers designed with discrete components are highly complex, containing numerous components and requiring a high level of analog design expertise. Further, the complexity and high component count of discrete switchers make them relatively costly, difficult to manufacture and prone to failures. Also, some discrete switchers lack protection and energy-efficiency features; adding these features may further increase the component count, cost and complexity of the power supply.
In high-power systems such as industrial motor drives, electric locomotives and renewable-energy systems, power conversion is typically performed using arrays of high-power silicon transistors known as IGBT modules; these modules are operated by electronic circuitry known as gate drivers (or IGBT drivers), whose function is to ensure accurate, safe and reliable operation of the IGBT modules. Like discrete power supplies, discrete gate drivers tend to be highly complex, requiring a large number of components and a great deal of design expertise.
Our Highly Integrated Approach
In 1994 we introduced TOPSwitch, the industry’s first cost-effective high-voltage IC for switched-mode AC-DC power supplies. We have since introduced a range of other product families, expanding the range of power-supply applications we can serve and enhancing our competitiveness in applications we already addressed
. 
In 2012 we expanded our addressable market to include high-voltage gate drivers, and in 2018 we introduced our BridgeSwitch motor-driver ICs for BLDC motors.
Our products drastically reduce the complexity and component count of power converters compared to typical discrete designs by integrating many of the functions otherwise performed by numerous discrete electronic components, and by eliminating (or reducing the size and cost of) additional components through innovative system design. As a result, our products enable power converters to have superior features and functionality at a total cost equal to or lower than that of many competing alternatives. Our products offer the following key benefits:
●
Fewer Components, Reduced Size and Higher Reliability
Our highly integrated ICs and gate drivers enable designs with up to 70% fewer components than comparable discrete designs. This reduction in component count enhances reliability and efficiency, reduces size, and results in lower manufacturing costs for our customers. Power supplies that incorporate our ICs are also lighter and more portable than comparable power supplies built with linear transformers, which are still used in some low-power applications.
●
Reduced Time-to-Market, Enhanced Manufacturability
Because our products eliminate much of the complexity associated with the design of power converters, designs can typically be completed in much less time, resulting in more efficient use of our customers’ design resources and shorter time-to-market for new designs. The lower component count and reduced complexity enabled by our products also makes designs more suitable for high-volume manufacturing. We also provide extensive hands-on design support as well as online design tools, such as our PI Expert design software, that further reduce time-to-market and product development risks.

Energy Efficiency
Our EcoSmart technology improves the energy efficiency of electronic devices during normal operation as well as standby and “no-load” conditions. This technology enables manufacturers to cost-effectively meet the growing demand for energy-efficient products, and to comply with increasingly stringent energy-efficiency requirements. Our proprietary GaN transistor technology, introduced in 2019, offers substantially higher levels of active-mode efficiency compared to traditional silicon switches, while our BridgeSwitch motor-driver ICs enable efficiency of up to 98.5%, not only minimizing waste but also eliminating the need for heatsinks in many applications, which in turn reduces cost and weight.
●
Wide Power Range and Scalability
Products in our current IC families can address AC-DC power supplies with output power up to approximately 500 watts as well as some high-voltage DC-DC applications; our high-voltage gate drivers are used in applications with power levels ranging from approximately 100 kilowatts to gigawatts, while our motor-driver ICs address BLDC applications up to about one horsepower. Within each of our product families, designers can scale up or down in power to address a wide range of designs with minimal design effort.
Energy Efficiency
Power supplies often draw significantly more electricity than the amount needed by the devices they power. As a result, billions of dollars’ worth of electricity is wasted each year, and millions of tons of greenhouse gases are unnecessarily produced by power plants. Energy waste occurs during the normal operation of a device and in standby mode, when the device is plugged in but idle. For example: computers and printers waste energy while in “sleep” mode; TVs that are turned off by remote control consume energy while awaiting a remote-control signal to turn them back on; a mobile-phone charger left plugged into a wall outlet continues to draw electricity even when not connected to the phone (a condition known as “no-load”); and many common household appliances, such as microwave ovens, dishwashers and washing machines, also consume power when not in use. In fact, a 2015 study by the National Resources Defense Council found that devices that are “always-on” but inactive may be causing as much as $19 billion in annual energy waste in the United States alone.
In response to concerns about the environmental impact of carbon emissions, policymakers have taken action to promote energy efficiency. For example, the ENERGY STAR® program and the European Union Code of Conduct encourage manufacturers of electronic devices to comply with voluntary energy-efficiency specifications. In 2007 the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) implemented mandatory efficiency standards for external power supplies. The CEC standards were implemented nationwide in the United States in July 2008 as a result of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”); these federal standards were tightened in 2016. Similar standards for external power supplies took effect in the European Union in 2010 as part of the EU’s EcoDesign Directive for Energy-Related Products.
In 2010, the EU EcoDesign Directive implemented standards limiting standby power consumption on a wide range of electronic products. The limit was reduced by 50 percent beginning in 2013, with many products now limited to 500 milliwatts of standby usage; the EU standards are scheduled to tighten further beginning in 2025. The EISA legislation also required substantial improvements in the efficiency of lighting technologies, effectively resulting in the phase-out of most incandescent light sources and increased adoption of LED-lighting technology. In December 2019 the government of China published new efficiency standards for room air conditioners, which took effect in July 2020. In 2022 India’s Bureau of Energy Efficiency implemented new labeling standards for ceiling fans in an effort to drive adoption of BLDC motors in place of less efficient induction motors.
We believe we offer products that enable manufacturers to meet or exceed these regulations, and all other such regulations of which we are aware. Since 1998, our AC-DC power-conversion ICs have featured our EcoSmart technology which drastically reduces standby power waste. We have sold more than 21 billion ICs featuring EcoSmart technology, resulting in estimated annual savings of about 15 terawatt-hours of standby power worldwide. In 2010 we expanded our portfolio of energy-saving products with the introduction of our CapZero and SenZero IC families, which eliminate additional sources of standby waste in some power supplies. We also offer a range of products designed specifically for LED-lighting applications. Our GaN technology, introduced in 2019, also dramatically improves the active-mode efficiency of power-supplies. Our InnoMux products, also introduced in 2019, enhance active-mode efficiency in systems with multiple DC outputs by eliminating the losses incurred in separate DC-DC conversion stages.

Products
Below is a brief description of our products:
●
AC-DC power conversion products
TOPSwitch, our first commercially successful product family, was introduced in 1994. Since then, we have introduced a wide range of products (such as our TinySwitch, LinkSwitch and Hiper families) to increase the level of integration and improve upon the functionality of the original TOPSwitch, and to broaden the range of power levels we can address. 
In 2014 we introduced our InnoSwitch product family, the first power-supply ICs to combine primary, secondary and feedback circuits into a single package. These ICs employ a proprietary technology known as FluxLink to enable precise control without the need for optical components, which tend to add cost and diminish the reliability of power supplies. In 2019 we began offering InnoSwitch ICs with more-efficient GaN transistors rather than silicon transistors. In 2023 we announced new versions of our InnoSwitch products incorporating GaN transistors with higher voltage ratings of 900 volts and 1250 volts; earlier GaN products feature transistors rated at 750 volts. In 2019 we introduced InnoMux ICs, which provide up to three DC outputs, eliminating the need for additional power-management circuitry in certain end products requiring multiple voltages while significantly increasing efficiency. In 2024 we introduced InnoMux-2 products, featuring GaN transistors rated at 1700 volts.
This portfolio of power-conversion products generally addresses power supplies up to about 500 watts of output. This market consists of an extremely broad range of applications including consumer appliances, utility meters, LCD monitors, tablets, smartphones, computers, TVs, and numerous other consumer and industrial applications, as well as LED lighting. We also now offer automotive-qualified versions of certain products, such as InnoSwitch ICs, for use in EVs. 
●
High-voltage gate drivers
We offer a range of high-voltage gate-driver products sold primarily under the SCALE and SCALE-2 product-family names. These products are fully assembled circuit boards incorporating multiple ICs, electrical isolation components and other circuitry. We offer both ready-to-operate “plug-and-play” drivers designed specifically for use with particular IGBT modules, as well as “driver cores,” which provide more basic driver functionality that customers can customize to their own specifications after purchase. In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriver family of standalone ICs, which enables us to address applications ranging from a few kilowatts up to about 100 kilowatts, whereas previously our sales of high-power products were primarily for applications above 100 kilowatts. In 2020 we introduced an automotive-qualified version of SCALE-iDriver suitable for use in powertrain and charging applications for electric vehicles.
●
Motor-driver products
The BridgeSwitch family of products, introduced in 2018, is a family of motor-driver ICs addressing BLDC motor applications up to approximately 400 watts. In 2024 we introduced BridgeSwitch-2 ICs, extending the addressable power range to about one horsepower, or 746 watts. Applications for ICs in the BridgeSwitch families include refrigerator compressors, ceiling fans, air purifiers and circulation pumps, as well as pumps and fans used in appliances such as dishwashers, laundry machines and boilers. BridgeSwitch products are complemented by our Motor-Expert software, which provides configuration and diagnostic tools for design engineers.

Sales, Distribution and Marketing
We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and merchant power-supply manufacturers through our direct sales staff and a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors. We have sales offices in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, India, China, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Canada, Singapore and Taiwan. Direct sales to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers represented approximately 30%, 31% and 30% of our net product revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, while sales to distributors accounted for the remainder in each of the corresponding years. Most of our distributors are entitled to return privileges based on revenues and are protected from price reductions affecting their inventories. Our distributors are not subject to minimum purchase requirements, and sales representatives and distributors can discontinue marketing our products at any time.
Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ requirements and in manufacturing availability. Historically, our business has been characterized by short-lead-time orders and quick delivery schedules.
Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for approximately 79%, 80% and 76% of net revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024, two customers, both distributors, each accounted for more than 10% of revenues, in 2023, three customers, all distributors, each accounted for more than 10% of revenues, and in 2022, 
two customers, both distributors, each accounted for more than 10% of revenues.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused on improving our technologies, introducing new products to expand our addressable markets, reducing the costs of existing products, and improving the cost-effectiveness and functionality of our customers’ power converters. We have assembled teams of highly skilled engineers to meet our research and development goals. These engineers have expertise in high-voltage device structure and process technology, analog and digital IC design, system architecture and packaging.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
We use a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual-property rights. In 2024, we received 26 U.S. and 49 foreign patents. As of December 31, 2024, we held 285 U.S. and 370 foreign patents. Both U.S. and foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2045. While our patent portfolio as a whole is important to the success of our business, we are not materially dependent upon any single patent. We also hold trademarks in the U.S. and various other geographies including Brazil, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
We regard as proprietary some equipment, processes, information and knowledge that we have developed and used in the design and manufacture of our products. Our trade secrets include a high-volume production process used in the manufacture of our high-voltage ICs. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements, proprietary-information agreements with employees and consultants, and other security measures.
Manufacturing
We contract with three foundries for the manufacture of the vast majority of our silicon wafers: (1) Lapis Semiconductor Co., Ltd., or Lapis, (formerly OKI Electric Industry), (2) Seiko Epson Corporation, or Epson and (3) X-FAB Semiconductor Foundries AG, or X-FAB. These contractors manufacture wafers using our proprietary high-voltage process technologies at fabrication facilities located in Japan, Germany and the United States.
Our ICs are assembled, packaged and tested by independent subcontractors in China, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines; a small percentage of our ICs are tested at our headquarters facility in California. Our gate-driver boards are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors in Sri Lanka and Thailand; some of the boards are tested at our facility in Switzerland.
Our fabless manufacturing model enables us to focus on our engineering and design strengths, minimize capital expenditures and still have access to high-volume manufacturing capacity. We utilize both proprietary and standard IC packages for assembly. Some of the materials used in our packages and certain aspects of the assembly process are specific to our products. We require our assembly manufacturers to use high-voltage molding compounds which are more difficult to process than industry standard molding compounds. We work closely with our contractors on a continuous basis to maintain and improve our manufacturing processes.
Our proprietary high-voltage processes do not require leading-edge geometries, which enables us to use our foundries’ older, lower-cost facilities for wafer manufacturing. However, because of our highly sensitive high-voltage process, we must interact closely with our foundries to achieve satisfactory yields. Our wafer supply agreements with Lapis, Epson and X-FAB expire in April 2028, December 2025 and December 2028, respectively. Under the terms of the Lapis and Epson agreements, each supplier has agreed to reserve a specified amount of production capacity and to sell wafers to us at fixed prices, which are subject to periodic review jointly by the supplier and us. In addition, Lapis and Epson require us to supply them with a rolling six-month forecast on a monthly basis. Our agreements with Lapis and Epson each provide for the purchase of wafers in U.S. dollars, with mutual sharing of the impact of the fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar. Under the terms of the X-FAB agreement, X-FAB has agreed to reserve a specified amount of production capacity and to sell wafers to us at fixed prices, which are subject to periodic review jointly by X-FAB and us. The agreement with X-FAB also requires us to supply them with rolling six-month forecasts on a monthly basis. Our purchases of wafers from X-FAB are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Although some aspects of our relationships with Lapis, Epson and X-FAB are contractual, some important aspects of these relationships are not written in binding contracts and depend on the suppliers’ continued cooperation. We cannot assure that we will continue to work successfully with Lapis, Epson or X-FAB in the future, that they will continue to provide us with sufficient capacity at their foundries to meet our needs, or that any of them will not seek an early termination of their wafer supply agreement with us. Our operating results could suffer in the event of a supply disruption with one or more of our foundries if we were unable to quickly qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products or if these sources were unable to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields.
We typically receive shipments from our foundries approximately four to six weeks after placing orders, and lead times for new products can be substantially longer. To provide sufficient time for assembly, testing and finishing, we typically need to receive wafers four weeks before the desired ship date to our customers. As a result of these factors and the fact that customers’ orders can be placed with little advance notice, we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products. We try to carry a substantial amount of wafer and finished-goods inventory to help offset these risks and to better serve our markets and meet customer demand.

Competition
Competing alternatives to our high-voltage ICs for the power-supply market include monolithic and hybrid ICs from companies such as STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies and Sanken Electric Company, as well as PWM-controller chips paired with discrete high-voltage silicon or GaN transistors. Such controller chips are produced by a large number of vendors, including those listed above as well as others including NXP Semiconductors, Diodes Inc., On-Bright Electronics, MediaTek Inc., Renesas Electronics and, in recent years, an increasing number of Chinese suppliers such as Southchip Semiconductor, Chipown Microelectronics and Hangzhou Silan Microelectronics Co. Our gate-driver products compete with alternatives from such companies as Infineon, Mitsubishi Electric, Fuji Electric, Semikron and Hangzhou Firstack Technology Co., as well as driver circuits made up of discrete devices. Our motor-driver ICs compete with power modules from such companies as ON Semiconductor, Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Mitsubishi and Sanken as well as discrete designs from a wide range of other suppliers. In general, we expect competition from Chinese semiconductor vendors to intensify over time reflecting China’s stated aim to develop its domestic semiconductor industry.
Generally, our products enable customers to design power converters with total bill-of-materials costs similar to those of competing alternatives. As a result, the value of our products is influenced by the prices of discrete components, which fluctuate in relation to market demand, raw-material prices and other factors, but have generally decreased over time.
While we vary the pricing of our ICs in response to fluctuations in prices of alternative solutions, we also compete based on a variety of other factors. Most importantly, the highly integrated nature of our products enables designs that utilize fewer total components than comparable discrete designs or designs using other integrated or hybrid products. This enables power converters to be designed more quickly and manufactured more efficiently and reliably than competing designs. We also compete on the basis of product functionality such as safety features and energy-efficiency features and on the basis of the technical support we provide to our customers. This support includes hands-on design assistance as well as a range of design tools and documentation such as software and reference designs. We also believe that our record of product quality and history of delivering products to our customers on a timely basis serve as additional competitive advantages.
Warranty
We generally warrant that our products will substantially conform to the published specifications for 12 months from the date of shipment. Under the terms and conditions of sale, our liability is limited generally to either a credit equal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective part.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including, but not limited to, laws, rules and regulations related to anti-corruption, antitrust, data privacy requirements, employment, environmental, foreign exchange controls, health and safety requirements, immigration, import/export requirements, IP and tax. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate in the case of environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could subject us to future liabilities.
