Item 2. Properties.
We own our principal executive, administrative, manufacturing and technical offices which are located in San Jose, California. We also own an R&D facility in New Jersey, a design center in Germany and a multipurpose office building in Switzerland. We lease administrative office space in Singapore, R&D facilities in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, New York, and Malaysia, and sales offices in various countries around the world to accommodate our sales force. We believe that our current facilities are sufficient for our near-term needs; however, if headcount increases above capacity we may need to lease additional space.
