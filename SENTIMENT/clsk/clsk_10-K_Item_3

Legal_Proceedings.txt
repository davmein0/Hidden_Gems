These forward-looking statements may include terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “due,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “plan,” “predict,” “potential,” “positioned,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends, or the negative of these terms or comparable terminations. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future operating results, potential risks pertaining to these future operating results, future plans or prospects, anticipated benefits of proposed (or future) acquisitions, dispositions and new facilities, growth, the capabilities and capacities of business operations, the remediation of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, any financial or other guidance, expected capital expenditures and all statements that are not based on historical fact, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate, as well as the economy, trends and other future conditions, are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and are subject to changes based on various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Therefore, we can give no assurance that the results implied by these forward-looking statements will be realized. Furthermore, the inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that future events, plans or expectations contemplated by the Company will be achieved. The following important factors, among others, could affect future results and events, causing those results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements:

•
our ability to achieve profitability, and to maintain profitability, in the future;

•
high volatility in the value attributable to our business;

•
the rapidly changing regulatory and legal environment in which we operate, which may lead to unknown future challenges to operating our business or may subject our business to added costs and/or uncertainty regarding the ability to operate;

•
the availability of financing opportunities, risks associated with economic conditions;

•
economic dependence on regulated terms of service and power rates; 

•
dependency on continued growth in blockchain and bitcoin usage; 

•
security and cybersecurity threats and hacks; 

•
our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts; 

•
dependency on third parties to maintain our cold and hot wallets that hold our bitcoin;

•
changes to bitcoin mining difficulty; 

•
our reliance on a limited number of key employees; 

•
changes in network and infrastructure; 

•
our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations, including the operations of GRIID Infrastructure, Inc.; 

•
bitcoin’s halving;

•
our ability to execute on our business strategy; 

•
our ability to remediate the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting;

•
other risks and uncertainties discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For a further list and description of various risks, factors and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections contained in this document, and any subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Given these risks and uncertainties, the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

You should read this document completely and with the understanding that our actual future results or events may be materially different from what we expect. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.

Information regarding market and industry statistics contained in this report is included based on information available to us that we believe is accurate, but that is not produced for purposes of securities filings or economic analysis. We have not independently verified any market, industry or similar data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and cannot assure you of its accuracy or completeness. Forecasts and other forward-looking statements obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and the additional uncertainties accompanying any estimates of future market size, revenue and market acceptance of products and services.

All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are made only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that subsequently occur, or of which we hereafter become aware. As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
