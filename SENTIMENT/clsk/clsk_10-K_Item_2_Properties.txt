Item 2. Properties

Our corporate headquarters is located in Henderson, Nevada and is owned by us. In addition, we own and lease air-cooled bitcoin mining facilities in Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. We own a property in College Park, Georgia that mines bitcoin through immersion technology and we own two parcels of land in Cheyenne, Wyoming that are currently under construction to develop immersion, bitcoin mining facilities. The leases have expiration dates between July 2026 through June 2039.

We believe our existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business. Please refer to the discussions contained in our Item 1. – “Business” for additional information.
