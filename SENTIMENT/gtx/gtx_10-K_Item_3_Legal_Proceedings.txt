Executive Summary
Garrett is a cutting-edge technology leader delivering differentiated solutions for emission reduction and energy efficiency. We design, manufacture, and sell highly engineered turbocharging, air and fluid compression, and high-speed electric motor technologies for OEMs and distributors within the mobility and industrial space. 
We have significant expertise in delivering products at scale for ICE-powered vehicles using gasoline, diesel, natural gas and hydrogen, as well as for zero-emission technologies using hydrogen fuel cell systems, both for mobility and industrial use. As our customers continue to progress on electrification, we are applying our technological pillars to develop highly engineered E-Powertrain and E-Cooling compressor products to support their ambition. These products are key enablers for fuel economy, energy efficiency, thermal management, and compliance with emissions standards and overall greenhouse gas and other emission reduction targets.
In 2024, turbocharger production decreased globally from approximately 50 million units in 2023 to 49 million units in 2024 and is expected to further decrease from 2025 onward based on current expectations of electric vehicle penetration. We effectively navigated through macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges by implementing strategic permanent and variable cost measures, as well as leveraging commodity deflation pass-through. Our effective management allowed us to achieve Net income of $282 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $598 million for the year.
We continue to achieve success in our turbocharging, hybrid, and zero-emission technology applications. This year, we secured additional pre-production contracts for both light vehicle and commercial vehicle applications, were awarded our first turbo application for a Range Extended Electric Vehicle with a leading Chinese technology company, and made significant progress in testing our new turbo off-highway applications. 
34

On April 3, 2024, we divested our equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture for approximately $58 million, subject to customary debt and working capital adjustments. We received cash consideration on the divestiture date of $46 million, with an additional $7 million still to be received, and recognized a gain of $27 million related to this divestiture.
 During the second quarter of 2024, we completed an offering of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032 (the "Senior Notes") and made early debt repayments totaling $985 million on our €450 million secured first-lien Euro Term Facility (the "Euro Term Facility") and $500 million secured first-lien U.S. Dollar term loan facility (the "2023 Dollar Term Facility"), both of which were fully repaid as of June 30, 2024.
 In December 2024, the Board of Directors announced that it intends to declare and pay quarterly dividends on our Common Stock in an aggregate amount of approximately $50 million in 2025. The first quarter dividend of $0.06 per share was declared on December 5, 2024, payable to holders of our Common Stock as of January 15, 2025, and was settled in cash for $12 million on January 31, 2025. 
Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities
Current global economic conditions due to geopolitical conflicts, high inflation in Europe, and China's slow pace of recovery, all have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect many industries, including the automotive industry. We believe a global increase in BEV production will persist into 2025. We anticipate that demand for turbochargers will remain steady in the short to medium term, driven by the growing penetration of hybridized powertrains in response to strict fuel efficiency and emissions standards. While we foresee continued growth in BEV adoption, we believe it will be somewhat constrained in the short term due to the price disparity compared to ICE vehicles, geopolitical risks, and the slower-than-expected development of charging infrastructure.

The change in net sales compared to the prior year is attributable to the following: 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net sales decreased compared to prior year by $411 million or 11%, including an unfavorable impact of $34 million or 1% due to foreign currency translation driven by lower Chinese Yuan-to-US dollar and lower Japanese Yen-to-US dollar exchange rates, partially offset by higher Euro-to-US dollar exchange rates. This decrease was mainly driven by soft demand in gasoline, diesel, and commercial vehicle applications, partially offset by demand for replacement parts on aftermarket sales. Net sales further decreased due to price, net of inflation pass-through driven by commodity deflation and partially offset by favorable product mix.
Gasoline product sales decreased by $215 million or 13% (including an unfavorable impact of $16 million or 1% due to foreign currency translation) driven by soft demand in China and North America, partially offset by program ramp-ups in Europe, the rest of Asia and South America.
Diesel product sales decreased by $165 million or 17% (including an unfavorable impact of $6 million or 1% due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by passenger vehicles in Europe, partially offset by sustained demand for pickup trucks in North and South America.
Commercial vehicle sales decreased by $27 million or 4% (including an unfavorable impact of $8 million or 1% due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by soft demand in the construction and agriculture industries due to high interest rates and lower crop prices, partially offset by sustained demand in the on-highway industry, especially in China and North America. 
Aftermarket sales increased by $3 million or 1% (including an unfavorable impact of $3 million or 0% due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by favorable aftermarket conditions and continued high demand for replacement parts in China, Europe, India, Brazil and Japan, partially offset by softer sales in Australia.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, net sales increased compared to prior year by $283 million or 8%, including an unfavorable impact of $14 million or 0% due to foreign currency translation driven by lower Chinese Yuan-to-US dollar, partially offset by higher Euro-to-US dollar exchange rates. This increase was driven by higher volumes with growth of both global light vehicles and the turbocharger industry, and faster than expected recovery from China Covid-19 pressures and semiconductor shortages experienced in the prior year. Strong demand for new product launches and ramp-ups along with inflation recoveries net of pricing across all product lines also contributed to the net sales growth.
36

Gasoline product sales increased by $235 million or 16% (including an unfavorable impact of $20 million or 1% due to foreign currency translation) driven by industry recovery from prior year’s global semiconductor shortages and Covid-related lockdown measures in China, combined with new product launches and ramp-ups across all regions.
Diesel product sales increased by $43 million or 5% (including a favorable impact of $10 million or 2% due to foreign currency translation), driven by strong performance in Europe where diesel remains essential to meet fleet CO2 targets in addition to strong light commercial vehicle performance on existing platforms.
Commercial vehicle sales decreased by $17 million or 3% (including an unfavorable impact of $7 million or 2% due to foreign currency translation), primarily driven by global demand softness influenced by macroeconomic headwinds such as higher interest rates and commodity inflation, partially offset by favorable regional mix.
Aftermarket sales improved by $14 million or 3% (including a favorable impact of $2 million or 0% due to foreign currency translation), primarily on strong demand in Europe and especially in Asia Pacific related to favorable aftermarket conditions including the continued high demand for replacement parts. Recovery in China from the end of the Chinese government's zero Covid-19 policy as well as new product introductions and favorable pricing impact also contributed to the growth.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, cost of goods sold decreased by $360 million, primarily driven by lower sales volumes which contributed a decrease of $290 million. Cost of goods sold further declined from $81 million of commodity, transportation and energy deflation, as well as a $98 million decrease from productivity, net of labor inflation and repositioning costs, and foreign currency impacts from transactional, translational, and hedging effects of $7 million. The decrease was partially offset by unfavorable product mix of $104 million and a $12 million increase in R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements, which reflects our continued investment in new technologies and related headcount year-over-year.
Gross profit decreased by $51 million, mainly driven by lower sales volumes which contributed a decrease of $122 million. Gross profit further declined from $50 million of price, net of inflation pass-through, $12 million higher R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements, and $27 million from foreign currency impacts from transactional, translational and hedging. These decreases were partially offset by $81 million of commodity, transportation and energy deflation, $72 million of productivity, net of labor inflation and repositioning costs, and $7 million of favorable impact from product mix.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of goods sold increased by $210 million, primarily driven by our higher sales volumes and an unfavorable product mix, which contributed to increases of $217 million and $27 million, respectively. Cost of goods sold further increased due to $30 million of inflation on commodities, transportation and energy, as well as a $14 million increase in R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements, which reflects our continued investment in new technologies and related headcount year-over-year. The increase was partially offset by our continued focus on productivity, net of labor inflation, one-time expenses and higher repositioning costs, which contributed a decrease in cost of goods sold of $55 million, and by foreign currency impacts from transactional, translational and hedging effects, which contributed a decrease in cost of goods sold of $23 million.
Gross profit increased by $73 million, mainly driven by higher sales volumes of $89 million and $60 million of productivity net of labor inflation, one-time expenses and higher repositioning costs. We also saw $38 million more of inflation recoveries from customer pass-through agreements net of pricing, and positive foreign currency impacts from transactional, translational and hedging of $9 million. These increases were partially offset by $30 million of inflation on commodities, transportation and energy costs, $79 million of unfavorable impacts from product mix primarily from growth in small-engine gasoline applications, as well as $14 million of higher R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased by $7 million compared with the prior year, primarily driven by $4 million of lower repositioning costs, $8 million of lower professional service and legal fees and $3 million of lower IT-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by $8 million of higher stock-based compensation expense and $1 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, SG&A expenses increased by $31 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to $9 million of legal and advisory fees related to the Transaction (as defined below)

For the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense decreased by $3 million compared to prior year. This reduction was primarily due to $24 million of higher gains recorded on our interest derivatives, lower interest from our $715 million secured first-lien U.S. Dollar term loan facility (the "2021 Dollar Term Facility") and 2023 Dollar Term 
38

Facility, partially offset by $15 million of accelerated debt issuance cost amortization, $4 million of higher marked-to-market remeasurement losses recorded on our undesignated interest rate swap contracts and $2 million of interest expense from our 2032 Senior Notes. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense increased by $151 million compared to prior year. This increase was mainly due to $33 million of marked-to-market remeasurement losses recorded in 2023 on our undesignated interest rate swap contracts versus $68 million of marked-to-market remeasurement gains in the prior year. We also saw $74 million of higher interest expense due to the new $700 million 2023 Dollar Facility and higher interest rates, and $12 million of debt issuance cost amortization primarily due to a $200 million early debt repayment. These increases in interest expense were partially offset by $10 million of interest accretion in the prior year on our Series B Preferred Stock that was fully redeemed in June 2022, and $28 million of gains on our interest derivatives in 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, non-operating income, net amounted to $13 million compared to $2 million in the prior year. The increase in non-operating income was primarily driven by a $13 million loss on remeasurement of the Series A Preferred Stock Agreements (as defined below) during the prior year and a $6 million increase in the non-service cost components of net periodic pension benefits, partially offset by $6 million of lower equity income due to the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.  
For the year ended December 31, 2023, non-operating income, net amounted to $2 million compared to $47 million in the prior year. The decrease in non-operating income was primarily driven by a $30 million decrease in the non-service components of net periodic pension benefits, a $13 million loss on the remeasurement of the Series A Preferred Stock Agreements during the three months ended June 30, 2023, and a $4 million increase in foreign exchange transactional losses.

The effective tax rate decreased by 7.0 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to releases of reserves due to statute of limitation expirations and settlements with taxing authorities and release of valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in Brazil (net of US branch taxes). In addition, there was prior year expense due to rate change impact on deferred tax assets attributable to the certification by the Chinese government of the High and New Technology Enterprise status of the Company’s China operations, which reduced the tax rate to 15% for the respective entity. These increases were partially offset by prior year tax benefits in Switzerland due to law changes (net of valuation allowance) and in Korea for prior year tax settlements.  
39

The effective tax rate increased by 3.4 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to the rate change impact on deferred tax assets attributable to the certification by the Chinese government of the High and New Technology Enterprise status of the Company’s China operations, which reduced the tax rate to 15% for the respective entity. Further, withholding tax and other taxes on foreign earnings have comparatively increased due to one-time non-recurring benefit recorded in 2022 related to accrued taxes on distributable reserves. These increases were partially offset by 2023 tax benefits in Switzerland due to law changes (net of valuation allowance) and in Korea for prior year tax settlements.  
In January 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) announced further work in continuation of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, focusing on two “pillars.” Pillar One provides a framework for the reallocation of certain residual profits of multinational enterprises to market jurisdictions where goods or services are used or consumed. Pillar Two consists of two interrelated rules referred to as Global Anti-Base Erosion (“GloBE”) Rules, which operate to impose a minimum tax rate of 15% calculated on a jurisdictional basis. On December 20, 2021, the OECD published GloBE model rules and released multiple rounds of commentary on those rules over the subsequent months. More than 135 OECD member countries have agreed to the key parameters of the model rules, which allow those OECD member countries to begin implementing the GloBE rules in a manner consistent with the agreement reached. The rules were adopted by a number of countries, with an effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2023. 
We do not expect that Pillar One will have an impact on our operations or effective tax rate. For 2024, Pillar Two does not have a material impact to our effective tax rate.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net income increased by $21 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to a $27 million gain on the sale of an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture, $7 million of lower SG&A expenses, $3 million of lower interest expense, $11 million of higher non-operating income, and lower income tax expense of $25 million as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by $51 million of decreased gross profit. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, net income decreased by $129 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to $151 million of higher interest expense, $31 million of higher SG&A expenses and $45 million of lower non-operating income, as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by $73 million of increased gross profit.
Non-GAAP Measures
Management provides non-GAAP financial information, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, to supplement the understanding of our business operations and performance, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the most directly comparable GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s operating results as reported under GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important indicators of operating performance and provide useful information for investors. 
1.
We define “EBITDA” as our net income calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus the sum of interest expense net of interest income, tax expense, depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA, plus the sum of 
stock compensation expense, repositioning costs, foreign exchange (gain) loss on debt net of related hedging (gain) loss, discounting costs on factoring, gain on sale of equity investment, acquisition and divestiture expenses, other non-operating income, capital structure transformation expense
s, debt refinancing and redemption costs, net reorganization items and loss on extinguishment of debt (if any);
 a
nd
2.
certain adjustment items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects the comparability of our results.
40

For 2024, we revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude acquisition and divestiture expenses, and debt refinancing and redemption costs. We did not revise prior years' Adjusted EBITDA because there were no such charges similar in nature.
In addition, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in setting performance incentive targets to align performance measurement with operational performance.

Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with year ended December 31, 2023
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net income increased by $21 million versus the prior year as discussed above within the Results of Operations section.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $37 million compared to the prior year, mainly from soft demand across all product lines except aftermarket, net of favorable product mix. Additionally, price net of inflation pass-through, higher R&D investment, and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts further reduced Adjusted EBITDA versus prior year. These declines were partially offset by operational productivity, net of labor inflation and repositioning costs, and commodity, transportation, and energy deflation year-over-year.
During 2024, we saw a decline in demand for our gasoline, diesel, and commercial vehicle applications, partially offset by favorable demand in aftermarket for replacement parts in North America, China and Europe. Net sales also decreased due to price, net of inflation pass-through, driven by commodity price decreases.
We drove strong operational productivity in 2024, flexing our variable cost structure and driving fixed cost productivity of $82 million. This, coupled with commodity, transportation, and energy deflation of $81 million versus prior year, partially offset the impact of volume declines and allowed us to expand our Adjusted EBITDA margin while funding a $12 million increase in R&D expenses, net of customer reimbursements.
Losses in foreign currency from translational, transactional, and hedging effects accounted for $23 million of the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with year ended December 31, 2022
For the year ended December 31, 2023, net income decreased by $129 million versus the prior year as discussed above within the Results of Operations section.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by $65 million compared to the prior year, mainly on higher volumes primarily in small-engine gasoline applications which drove unfavorable mix impact. Additionally, operational productivity and inflation pass-through net of pricing contributed $69 million improvement year-over-year offsetting $14 million higher R&D investment including new zero emission technologies. The impact of foreign currency impact was zero for the year. 
42

During 2023, we saw strong customer demand increases in diesel and gasoline product lines, in a less disruptive supply chain environment, as the industry recovered from semiconductor shortages experienced in the prior year. Favorable impacts were also experienced from new product launches in gasoline, favorable aftermarket conditions such as continued high demand for replacement parts and new product launches coupled with price increases. 
We maintained our focus on productivity in 2023 as rising commodity prices led to higher raw material costs, particularly for steel alloys and nickel. We recovered most of these increases through customer pass-through agreements, especially on nickel, and continue to negotiate with our customers for further pass-through while actively managing our supply base and cost recovery mechanisms to minimize the impact of materials cost inflation. The increased productivity was partially offset by year-over-year labor inflation.
R&D expenses increased $14 million which reflects our continued investment in new technologies, increased hiring to accelerate growth in the new technologies and year-over-year labor inflation, net of customer reimbursements.
There was no impact from foreign currency with translational and transactional impacts being offset by hedge remeasurement.

On May 21, 2024, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Garrett Motion Holdings Inc. and Garrett LX I S.a.r.l., completed an offering of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Senior Notes. The 2032 Senior Notes mature on May 31, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum. We incurred $12 million of debt issuance costs, which have been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis. 
On May 21, 2024, we also entered into the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2021, by and among the Company, Garrett Motion Holdings Inc., Garrett Motion Sàrl and Garrett LX I S.à.r.l., the lenders and issuing banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") which (i) removed the credit spread adjustment with respect to certain US dollar denominated term loan borrowings that are Term Benchmark Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (ii) reduced the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on certain US dollar denominated term loans to 2.75% for Term Benchmark Loans and 1.75% for ABR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (iii) increased the maximum borrowings available under the Revolving Facility by $30 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repaid $500 million on our 2023 Dollar Term Facility, $485 million (€450 million) on our Euro Term Facility and $7 million on our 2021 Dollar Term Facility.  
For 2025, we expect capital spending to increase slightly as compared to 2024. We expect to make net repayments of $7 million on our term loan borrowings following the refinancing of our term loan as discussed in Note 29, 
Subsequent Events
 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to pay approximately $42 million related to purchase obligations which were entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. We expect to make contributions of approximately $5 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Finally, we also expect to declare and pay quarterly dividends on our Common Stock in an aggregate amount of approximately $50 million in 2025, of which $12 million was paid on January 31, 2025.  
We fund our operations primarily through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings from our credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents. We believe the combination of expected cash flows, the term loan borrowings and the 
43

revolving credit facilities being committed until 2030, will provide us with adequate liquidity to support the Company's operations. 
Share Repurchase Program
On February 13, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a $350 million share repurchase program valid until December 31, 2024. For more information, see Item 5. 
Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased $296 million of its Common Stock. The share repurchase program expired on December 31, 2024. 
On December 4, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new $250 million share repurchase program valid January 1, 2025 until December 31, 2025. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
The Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Cash Flow Summary for the year ended December 31, 2024
Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by a $32 million change in working capital related primarily to inventory purchases and higher payments made during the current year, partially offset by increased collections. A decrease of $14 million in net income, excluding the effects of non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in other assets and liabilities of $11 million, also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities.
Cash used for investing activities decreased by $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus the prior year. The decrease is due to $46 million of proceeds from the sale of an equity investment, $3 million of higher proceeds from our cross-currency swap contracts which have been designated as net investment hedges of our Euro-denominated operations versus the prior year, and $8 million of lower expenditures for property, plant and equipment versus the prior year. 
Cash used for financing activities increased by $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the prior year. During 2024, we made an aggregate of $992 million in debt repayments on our term loan facilities. We also made payments of $296 million for the repurchase of Common Stock under our share repurchase program, $8 million for debt issuance costs, $8 million for excise taxes related to Common Stock repurchases and $9 million for other financing activities during the current year. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $794 million, net of deferred financing costs, from the issuance of our 2032 Senior Notes. In comparison, cash used for financing activities in the prior year was primarily related an aggregate amount of $605 million paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), related to the Transaction, including conversion of the Series A 
44

Preferred Stock as discussed in Note 21, 
Equity
 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also made payments of $213 million for the repurchase of Common Stock under our share repurchase program and debt repayments of $207 million. 
Cash Flow Summary for the year ended December 31, 2023
Cash provided by operating activities increased by $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 versus the prior year. The increase was driven by $63 million of working capital contribution related primarily to build-ups of inventory in the prior year. An increase of $32 million in net income, excluding the effects of non-cash items, also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a decrease in other assets and liabilities of $5 million.
Cash used for investing activities decreased by $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 versus the prior year. The decrease is due to $28 million of proceeds from our cross-currency swap contracts which have been designated as net investment hedges of our Euro-denominated operations and $8 million of lower expenditures for property, plant and equipment. 
Cash used for financing activities decreased by $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with the prior year. Cash flows used 
for
 financing activities included $667 million from the 2023 Dollar Term Facility net of debt financing costs. We paid an aggregate amount of $605 million to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock related to the Transaction, including conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock as discussed above and in Note 21, 
Equity
 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also made payments of $213 million for the repurchase of Common Stock under our share repurchase program and debt repayments of $207 million. In comparison, cash used for financing activities in the prior year was primarily related to the Company's payment of $381 million for the final early redemption of our Series B Preferred Stock (exclusive of $28 million attributable to interest and included in cash from operating activities) and $83 million for dividends on Series A Preferred Stock, while in 2023, there were $42 million in payments of accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock through June 2023. 
Capital Expenditures
We believe our capital spending in recent years has been sufficient to maintain efficient production capacity, to implement important product and process redesigns and to expand capacity to meet increased demand. We expect capital expenditures in 2025 to increase slightly as compared to 2024, primarily driven by higher investments for new product launches across our zero emission and turbo technologies.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies and estimates discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Revenue Recognition 
— 
Product sales are recognized when we transfer control of the promised goods to our customer, which is based on shipping terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods, adjusted for any variable consideration such as price concessions or annual price adjustments as estimated at contract inception. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we will receive from customers and reduce revenues recognized accordingly. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the value of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed.
Contingent Liabilities 
— We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, 
45

for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 25, 
Commitments and Contingencies
 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our most significant contingencies.
Warranties and Guarantees 
— Expected warranty costs for products sold are recognized based on an estimate of the amount that eventually will be required to settle such obligations. These accruals are based on factors such as past experience, length of the warranty and various other considerations. Costs of product recalls, which may include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the recalled part, are accrued as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are adjusted from time to time based on facts and circumstances that impact the status of existing claims. See Note 25, 
Commitments and Contingencies
 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information.
Pension Benefits 
— We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees, primarily in Switzerland, the U.S. and Ireland. The pension cost and liabilities for these plans are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and compensation increases. The Company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and employee demographics such as retirement patterns, in making its assumptions. Changes in the related pension benefit costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions.
The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (the measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our pension obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. The assumptions as to the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are based upon historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations. 
We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (the “MTM Adjustment”). 
Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments as the adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.
Income Taxes 
— 
We account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires us to recognize current tax liabilities or receivables for the amount of taxes we estimate are payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period enacted. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the period in which related temporary differences become deductible. 
We file tax returns in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Tax authorities have the ability to review and challenge matters that could be subject to differing interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of tax attributes. The ultimate resolution of such uncertainties could last several years. When an uncertain tax position is identified, we consider and interpret complex tax laws and regulations in order to determine the need for recognizing a provision in our financial statements. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We utilize internal and external expertise in interpreting tax laws to support our tax 
46

positions. We recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on the underlying technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination.
Although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, they could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which such determination is made. A change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
about Market Risks
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates. These exposures may impact future earnings and/or operating cash flows. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. 
We historically have hedged balance sheet as well as forecasted currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward contracts. 
We hedge forecasted currency exposure to minimize the earnings exposures arising from foreign currency exchange  risk on foreign currency purchases and sales. Under our cash flow hedging program, we designate certain foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of underlying foreign currency forecasted purchases and sales, with gains and losses on the qualifying derivatives recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the underlying forecasted transactions are recognized in earnings. These contracts have varying terms that extend through 2026. We also utilize undesignated foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset gains and losses on the foreign currency remeasurement of balance sheet positions. 
Effective with our entry into the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into float-to-float cross-currency swap contracts to limit its exposure to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. The cross-currency swap contracts have been designated as net investment hedges of its Euro-denominated operations. Gains and losses on the derivatives qualifying as net investment hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the net investment is liquidated or sold.
The Company also uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk on its 2032 Senior Notes. The cross-currency swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, with changes in the fair value of the derivatives recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings based upon changes in the spot rate remeasurement of the underlying debt. 
As of December 31, 2024, the net fair value of all financial instruments with exposure to currency risk was a $87 million asset. The potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be $196 million and $(196) million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 exchange rates. The model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates; however, currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
47

Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to risk based on changes in interest rates relates primarily to our Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement bears interest at floating rates. For variable rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt assuming all other factors remain constant but do impact future earnings and cash flows. Accordingly, we may be exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We manage this risk by entering into interest rate swap contracts to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt to reduce market risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, the net fair value of all financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was a $6 million asset. 
For our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024, a 50 basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would have increased (decreased) our interest expense by $4 million and ($4) million, respectively, compared to the amount of interest that would have been incurred in such period based on the rates of interest in effect at December 31, 2024. For additional information regarding our Credit Agreement, see Note 16, 
Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements
 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commodity Price Risk
We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and are subject to changes in our cost of sales caused by movements in underlying commodity prices. Approximately 83% of our cost of sales consists of purchased components with significant raw material content. A substantial portion of the purchased parts are made of nickel, aluminum and steel alloys. We have index-based escalators in place with most of our suppliers for raw material inflation / deflation. As our costs change, we may be contractually able to pass through a portion of the changes in commodity prices to certain of our customers in accordance with long-term agreements. Where long-term pass-through agreements are not in place with customers, we generally seek to negotiate additional pricing arrangements with our customers. Assuming current levels of commodity purchases, a 10% variation in the commodity prices could impact our cost of sales by up to approximately $43 million per year prior to any price recovery from customers.

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control
 — 
Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garrett Motion Inc.   
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garrett Motion Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). 
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Net Sales and Accrued Liabilities - Customer Pricing Reserve related to Variable Consideration – 
Refer
 to Notes 3 and 15 to the Financial Statements

Critical Audit Matter Description
As disclosed in Notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records net sales at the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods, which includes estimates of variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. Variability in consideration typically results from discounts and rebates provided to customers. The estimated variable consideration is based primarily on management’s best available information regarding customer negotiations, historical experience, and anticipated future customer pricing strategies. Estimating variable consideration requires significant 
50

judgments by management that affect the amount of revenue recorded in the financial statements.  The amount of customer pricing reserve as of December 31, 2024 is $77 million.  
Given the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to estimate future discounts and rebates, auditing management's estimates of the amount of customer pricing reserve related to variable consideration to recognize as net sales required a high degree of auditor judgement. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the estimate of variable consideration and the customer pricing reserve included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of relevant controls over the estimation of the variable consideration within net sales including review of discounts and rebates which impact the customer pricing reserve.
•
We selected a sample of revenue contracts with variable consideration and performed the following:
◦
Obtained contractual documents, including master agreements and other related documents, and evaluated whether variable consideration were consistent with the terms of the contracts.
◦
Compared transaction prices to the consideration expected to be received to assess whether variable consideration was completely and accurately recorded. 
•
We further tested management's estimate of the variable consideration and performed the following:
◦
Evaluated historical information to determine management’s ability to accurately estimate sales volumes and future concessions.
◦
Inquired with individuals in the Company’s finance, operations and sales departments regarding the customer negotiations and examined supporting evidence as applicable.
◦
Performed retrospective assessment of the previous year's accruals within the customer pricing reserve to ensure they were appropriately utilized throughout the current period, in order to conclude on management's ability to make reliable forecasts.
◦
Tested the mathematical accuracy of the variable consideration calculation.
We inspected manual revenue journal entries for unusual entries affecting revenue and examined supporting evidence.

GARRETT MOTION INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Background and Basis of Presentation
Background
Garrett Motion Inc. (the "Company" or "Garrett") is a cutting-edge technology leader delivering differentiated solutions for emission reduction and energy efficiency. We design, manufacture and sell highly engineered turbocharging, air and fluid compression, and high-speed electric motor technologies for OEMs and distributors within the mobility and industrial space. We have significant expertise in delivering products at scale for ICE using gasoline, diesel, natural gas and hydrogen, as well as for zero emission technologies using hydrogen fuel cell systems, both for mobility and industrial use. As our customers continue to progress on electrification, we are applying our technological pillars to develop highly engineered E-Powertrain and E-Cooling compressor products to support their ambition. These products are key enablers for fuel economy, energy efficiency, thermal management, and compliance with emissions standards and overall greenhouse gas and other emission reduction targets.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All amounts presented are in millions, except per share amounts. 
We evaluate segment reporting in accordance with ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
. We concluded that Garrett operates in a single operating segment and a single reportable segment based on the operating results available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is our Chief Executive Officer, to make decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The CODM makes operational performance assessments and resource allocation decisions on a consolidated basis, inclusive of all of the Company’s products across channels and geographies.
Note 2. Plan of Reorganization
On September 20, 2020 (the "Petition Date"), the Company and certain of its subsidiaries each filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the "Chapter 11 Cases") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). A Revised Amended Plan of Reorganization ("Plan") was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on April 26, 2021, and the Company emerged from bankruptcy (“Emergence”) on April 30, 2021 (the "Effective Date"). 
The Company applied ASC 852, 
Reorganizations
, in preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, which required the financial statements for periods subsequent to filing for Chapter 11 to distinguish transactions and events that were directly associated with the Company's reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Revenues, expenses, realized gains and losses, and provisions for losses directly resulting from the reorganization and restructuring were reported separately as Reorganization items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Upon Emergence, the Company did not meet the requirements under ASC 852 for fresh start accounting and in accordance with ASC 852, a new reporting entity was not created for accounting purposes.
Reorganization items, net represent amounts incurred after the Petition Date as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases and amounted to an expense of $
3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. There were 
no
 Reorganization items, net for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of changes are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.
Principles of Consolidation and Combination
57

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Garrett Motion Inc. and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. We consolidate entities that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest, and we consolidate variable interest entities when we have variable interests and are the primary beneficiary. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but in which we do not have a controlling financial interest to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash primarily consists of bank deposits pledged as collateral to issue bank notes
 (refer to Note 9, 
Factoring and Notes Receivable
).
Trade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount as a result of transactions with customers. In accordance with ASC 326, 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
, the Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for losses as a result of a customer’s inability to make required payments, estimated based on the expected credit losses over the contractual life of the receivables based on days past due as measured from the contractual due date and collection history. The Company also takes into consideration changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends (for example, customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization). Receivables are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are determined uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account, including time intervals since last collection, customer performance against agreed upon payment plans, solvency of customer and any bankruptcy proceedings.
Transfer of Financial Instruments
Sales and transfers of financial instruments are accounted for under ASC 860,
 Transfers and Servicing. 
The Company may discount and sell accounts receivables during the normal course of business. These receivables which are transferred to a third party without recourse to the Company and that meet the criteria of sales accounting as per ASC 860, are excluded from the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash proceeds received from such sales are included in operating cash flows. The expenses associated with the factoring of receivables are recorded within Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company may also receive bank notes in settlement of accounts receivables, primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Such bank notes are classified as notes receivables under Accounts, notes and other receivables – net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The collections of such bank notes are included in operating cash flows and any expenses related to discounting these are included within Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company can hold the bank notes until maturity, exchange them with suppliers to settle liabilities, or sell them to third party financial institutions in exchange for cash.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs, or net realizable value. Obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues. The original equipment inventory on hand in excess of forecasted usage and lack of consumption in the previous 12 months is fully reserved, unless the value of such material is recoverable from either the vendor or the customer.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets, which are 
10
 to 
50
 years for buildings and improvements, 
2
 to 
16
 years for machinery and equipment, 
3
 to 
10
 years for tooling equipment, and 
5
 to 
7
 years for software. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
58

Impairment testing of long lived assets is completed by the Company in accordance with ASC 360, 
Property, Plant and Equipment
. The testing is completed when a triggering event occurs, or at least on an annual basis to assess if any impairment triggering events existed during the year. If a triggering event occurs or is identified, the impairment testing is completed using the two-step impairment model. Asset classes are identified and tested for recoverability by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The impairment analysis was completed in 2024 with no triggering events identified.

Leases
Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of a lease (the “commencement date”) based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Property, plant and equipment - net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease where it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are expensed in the period in which they occur. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For machinery and equipment, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We account for short-term leases by recognizing lease payments in net income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and will not recognize any ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying value to fair value of our single reporting unit. The Company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit´s fair value. However, any impairment should not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Because we have a single reporting unit with a negative carrying value, no impairment was recognized.
Warranties and Guarantees
Expected warranty costs for products sold are recognized based on an estimate of the amount that eventually will be required to settle such obligations. These accruals are based on factors such as past experience, length of the warranty and various other considerations. Costs of product recalls, which may include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the recalled part, are accrued as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are adjusted from time to time based on facts and circumstances that impact the status of existing claims.
 For additional information, see Note 25, 
Commitments and Contingencies
.
Sales Recognition
Product sales are recognized when we transfer control of the promised goods to our customer, which is based on shipping terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods, adjusted for any variable consideration such as price concessions or annual price adjustments as estimated at contract inception. Amounts billed but ultimately expected to be refunded to the customer are recorded as part of the customer pricing reserve within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
In the sale of products in the OEM channel, the transaction price for these goods is generally equal to the agreed price of each unit and represents the standalone selling price for the unit. In the sale of products in the aftermarket channel, the terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, discounts and rebates. 
We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we will receive from customers and reduce revenues recognized accordingly. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant 
59

reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the value of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed.
Research and Development
Garrett conducts research and development (“R&D”) activities, which consist primarily of the development of new products and product applications. R&D costs are charged to expense as incurred. Such costs are included in Cost of goods sold and were $
187
 million, 
$
175
 million and $
153
 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, the Company incurs engineering-related expenses which are also included in Cost of goods sold and amounted to
 $(
26
) million,

$(
12
) million and $
11
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Engineering-related expenses included customer reimbursements of $
67
 million, $
46
 million and $
25
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Certain engineering expenses related to long-term supply arrangements are capitalized when defined criteria, such as the existence of a contractual guarantee for reimbursement, are met. As of December 31, 2024 and 
2023
, $
29
 million and $
12
 million, respectively, of such contractually reimbursable costs were capitalized. These amounts are recorded within Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Government Incentives
The Company receives incentives from governmental entities related to expenses, assets, and other activities. The associated terms of the incentives can vary by country. Government incentives are recorded in the financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, a reduction of asset cost or other operating or non-operating income. Incentives are recognized when there is probable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions for the incentives and a reasonable expectation that the funds will be received. Government incentives received prior to being earned are recognized as deferred income whereas incentives earned prior to being received are recognized as receivables.
 The Company recognized government incentives of $
19
 million, $
14
 million and $
25
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts are recorded in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Supplier Financing
The Company has supplier financing arrangements with 
two
 third-party financial institutions under which certain suppliers may factor their receivables from Garrett. The Company also enters into arrangements with banking institutions to issue bankers acceptance drafts in settlement of accounts payables, primarily in the Asia Pacific region. The bankers acceptance drafts, or guaranteed bank notes, have a contractual maturity of 
six months
 or less, and may be held by suppliers until maturity, transferred to their suppliers, or discounted with financial institutions in exchange for cash. 
Supplier financing obligations
 outstanding and guaranteed bank notes outstanding are recorded within Accounts payable.

Environmental Matters
The Company records liabilities for environmental assessments and remediation activities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are recorded at undiscounted amounts, based on experience and assessments and are regularly evaluated. To the extent that the 
60

required remediation procedures change, or additional contamination is identified, the Company’s estimated environmental liabilities may also change. The liabilities are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Stock-Based Compensation
The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 23, 
Stock-Based Compensation
, are performance stock units and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) based on the Company's best estimate of ultimate performance against the award targets, and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

Pension Benefits
We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees, primarily in Switzerland, the U.S. and Ireland. For such plans, we are required to disaggregate the service cost component of net benefit costs and report those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non service components of net benefit costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. We record the service cost component of Pension expense (income) in Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of net benefit costs within Pension expense (income), primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in Non-operating expense (income). We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 
10
% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (“MTM Adjustment”). The MTM Adjustment is recorded in Non-operating expense (income).
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI").
Derivative Financial Instruments
We minimize our risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged items. For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, provided the hedging relationship is highly effective, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in AOCI until the net investment is liquidated or sold.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires us to recognize current tax liabilities or receivables for the amount of taxes we estimate are payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period enacted. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The 
61

ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the period in which related temporary differences become deductible. 
We reclassify taxes from AOCI to earnings as the items to which the tax effects relate are similarly reclassified.
Earnings per share
For the year ended December 31, 2024, basic earnings per share are calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, basic earnings per share were calculated using the two-class method, because our Series A Preferred Stock was considered a participating security prior to its conversion into Common Stock and cancellation pursuant to the Transaction. The two-class method requires an allocation of earnings to all securities that participate in dividends with common shares, which included our Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that each such security may share in the Company's earnings. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing undistributed earnings allocated to Common Stock by the weighted average number of common shares. 
Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2024 is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings per share for the yeas ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class or if-converted methods. The two-class method uses net income available to common shareholders and assumes conversion of all potential shares other than the participating securities. The if-converted method uses net income and assumes conversion of all potential shares including the participating securities.
 See Note 24, 
Earnings Per Share
 for further details.
Related Party Transactions
We contract with Trane Technologies ("Trane") for the occasional purchase of goods and services. Mr. Paul Camuti, a director on our Board of Directors, served as an executive officer of Trane through December 31, 2024, and was considered a related party until that time. Our payments under the agreements with Trane amounted to $
1
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and were included in Cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The liability balance due to Trane as of December 31, 2024, was 
immaterial
.
We lease certain facilities and receive property maintenance services from Honeywell International ("Honeywell"), which as of Emergence was the owner of our Series B Preferred Stock that has since been fully redeemed by the Company, is a holder of our Common Stock and was also a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock prior to the Transaction, as discussed below and in Note 21, 
Equity
.  We also contract with Honeywell for the occasional purchase of certain goods and services. Lease and service agreements were made at commercial terms prevalent in the market at the time they were executed. Honeywell is not considered a related party subsequent to the Transaction, which occurred on June 6, 2023. 
Our payments under the agreements with Honeywell during the period that they were considered a related party amounted to $
2
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $
9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and were included in Cost of goods sold, and Selling, general and administrative expenses, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
As discussed in Note 21, 
Equity
, in order to effect the Transaction, on April 12, 2023, the Company entered into separate definitive agreements (the "Series A Preferred Stock Agreements") with each of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (“Centerbridge”) and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), to effect a series of integrated transactions (collectively, the "Transaction") designed to simplify the Company's capital structure by converting all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into a single class of Common Stock, subject to certain conditions. Each of Centerbridge and Oaktree is a holder of our Common Stock and appoints a director to our Board of Directors. Mr. Kevin Mahony, who serves as a Senior Managing Director of Centerbridge, and Mr. Steven Tesoriere, who serves as a Managing Director and Co-Portfolio Manager of Oaktree, have been appointed to our Board of Directors as designees of Centerbridge and Oaktree, respectively. As described more fully in Note 21, 
Equity
, in connection with the Transaction, we paid to Centerbridge and Oaktree an aggregate of approximately $
570
 million for the repurchase of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, plus an aggregate of approximately $
10
 million and 
7,276,036
 shares of Common Stock representing the Additional Amounts and Accumulated Dividends in respect of the repurchased shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Additionally, in connection with the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock that each of Centerbridge and Oaktree held as of the conversion date, we issued to Centerbridge and Oaktree an aggregate of 
65,334,277
 shares of Common Stock upon the 
62

conversion of an equivalent number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, plus Additional Amounts and Accumulated Dividends of approximately $
9
 million and 
6,819,540
 shares of Common Stock.
In connection with the conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, we issued to Honeywell, as a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, 
4,196,330
 shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of an equivalent number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, plus Additional Amounts and Accumulated Dividends of approximately $
1
 million and 
438,009
 shares of Common Stock. 
Additionally, Mr. John Petry, a director on our Board in 2023, serves as Managing Member of Sessa Capital (Master), L.P., which indirectly held shares of our Series A Preferred Stock prior to the conversion. In connection with the conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, we issued to Sessa Capital and its affiliates, as holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, 
16,592,384
 shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of an equivalent number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, plus Additional Amounts and Accumulated Dividends of approximately $
2
 million and 
1,731,900
 shares of Common Stock. 
During 2024, we also repurchased from Centerbridge a total of 
2,808,988
 shares of Common Stock for $
25
 million under our share repurchase program. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock.

Note 4. Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers
The Company generates revenue through the sale of products to customers in the OEM and aftermarket channels. OEM and aftermarket contracts generally include scheduling agreements that stipulate the pricing and delivery terms that identify the quantity and timing of the product to be transferred. 
Disaggregated Revenue 
63

For Net sales by region (determined based on country of shipment) and channel, refer to Note 27, 
Segments and Concentrations
. We recognize virtually all of our revenues arising from performance obligations at a point in time. Less than 
1
% of our revenue is satisfied over time. 
Contract Balances 
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed accounts receivable, reported in Accounts, notes and other receivables – net, and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities), reported in Accrued Liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract assets arise when the timing of billing to customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition. Contract assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized once invoiced in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded in scenarios where we enter into arrangements where customers are contractually obligated to remit cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations and recognizing revenue. Contract liabilities are generally derecognized when revenue is recognized. 
These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

Performance Obligations 
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For product sales, typically each product sold to a customer represents a distinct performance obligation. 
Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. All performance obligations are expected to be satisfied within 
one year
, with substantially all performance obligations being satisfied within a month.
The timing of satisfaction of our performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment, with most cash advances (contract liabilities) and unbilled receivables (contract assets) being settled within 
3
 months. For some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.
We have applied the practical expedient to not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected term of 
one year
 or less.

The effective tax rate decreased by 
7.0
 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to releases of reserves due to statute of limitation expirations and settlements with taxing authorities and release of valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in Brazil (net of US branch taxes). In addition, there was prior year expense due to rate change impact on deferred tax assets attributable to the certification by the Chinese government of the High and New Technology Enterprise status of the Company’s China operations, which reduced the tax rate to 15% for the respective entity. These increases were partially offset by prior year tax benefits in Switzerland due to law changes (net of valuation allowance) and in Korea for prior year tax settlements.  
The effective tax rate increased by 
3.4
 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to the rate change impact on deferred tax assets attributable to the certification by the Chinese government of the High and New Technology Enterprise status of the Company’s China operations, which reduced the tax rate to 15% for the respective entity. Further, withholding tax and other taxes on foreign earnings have comparatively increased due to one-time non-recurring benefit recorded in 2022 related to accrued taxes on distributable reserves. These increases were partially offset by 2023 tax benefits in Switzerland due to law changes (net of valuation allowance) and in Korea for prior year tax settlements.

We also have net operating loss carryforwards in certain US state jurisdictions, the tax effect of which is not significant.
We maintain a valuation allowance of $
29
 million against a portion of total deferred tax assets.  In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to tax expense in the period that such determination is made. Our valuation allowance decreased $
23
 million from the prior period primarily attributable to a determination that we can ultimately benefit net deferred tax assets recorded in Brazil due to current and future forecasted earnings. Our balance sheet presents a deferred tax asset of $
207
 million and a deferred tax liability of $
25
 million after considering jurisdictional netting. 
The Company does not intend to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and have recorded a deferred tax liability, mainly consisting of withholding taxes, of approximately $
18
 million as of December 31, 2024.  The company has historically considered a portion of its undistributed foreign earnings in China as permanently reinvested.  In the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company changed this assertion and these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested.

 million, all of which, if recognized, would reduce tax expense and the effective tax rate.
Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits are classified as a component of tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and totaled $

We are currently under audit in multiple jurisdictions, primarily India for tax years 2021 through 2023 and U.S. for tax years 2018 through 2020.  Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will significantly change from those recorded as liabilities in our financial statements.

Note 16. Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements
Long Term Debt
Senior Notes
On May 21, 2024, Garrett Motion Holdings Inc. and Garrett LX I S.à.r.l. (the "Issuers"), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, completed an offering of $
800
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
7.75
% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032 (the "2032 Senior Notes"). The 2032 Senior Notes mature on May 31, 2032. The Company incurred $
12
 million of debt issuance costs, which have been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis. 
The 2032 Senior Notes are guaranteed by the Company and each of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the existing Credit Agreement (as defined below), subject to certain exceptions. The proceeds 
71

from the sale of the 2032 Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay approximately $
800
 million of term loan indebtedness, as described below, and to pay related fees and expenses. 
Term Loans
On the Effective Date, in accordance with the Plan, 
the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for the following long-term senior secured financing (collectively, the "Term Loan Facilities")
:
•
2021 Dollar Facility
: a 
seven-year
 secured first-lien U.S. Dollar term loan facility for $
715
 million (the "2021 Dollar Term Facility");
•
2023 Dollar Facility
: a 
five-year
 secured first-lien U.S. Dollar term loan facility for $
700
 million (the "2023 Dollar Term Facility"); and
•
Euro Facility
: a 
seven-year
 secured first-lien Euro term loan facility for €
450
 million (the "Euro Term Facility"). 
The principal outstanding and carrying amounts of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

Revolving Facility and Letters of Credit
The Credit Agreement also provides for a 
senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility providing for multi-currency revolving loans (the "Revolving Facility", and together with the Term Loan Facilities, the "Credit Facilities"). The Revolving Facility matures on 
April 30, 2028 and has a
 maximum borrowing capacity of $
600
 million. See discussion in "
Amendments to the Credit Agreement"
, below).
Under the Revolving Facility, the Company may use up to $
125
 million for the issuance 
of letters of credit to its subsidiaries. Letters of credit are available for issuance under the Credit Agreement on terms and conditions customary for financings of this kind, which issuances will reduce availability under the Revolving Facility. As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility, 
no
 outstanding letters of credit, and available 
72

borrowing capacity of $
600
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility, 
no
 outstanding letters of credit, and available borrowing capacity of $
570
 million. 
Separate from the Revolving Facility, the Company has a bilateral letter of credit facility with outstanding letters of credit of $
8
 million and $
12
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The letters of credit typically support customs arrangements and other obligations at its local affiliates. 
Amendments to the Credit Agreement
The Company entered into a first and second amendment of the Credit Agreement on January 11, 2022 and March 22, 2022, respectively. Under the first amendment, the maximum borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility was increased from $
300
 million to $
475
 million. The London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") was replaced as an available rate at which borrowings under the Revolving Facility could accrue with, for loans borrowed in U.S. Dollars, the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and for loans borrowed in Australian Dollars, the average bid reference rate administered by ASX Benchmarks Pty Limited. 
The second amendment removed the requirement that payments made in cash for the benefit of holders of shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock on or before December 31, 2022 be made on a ratable basis to the holders of the Common Stock, and made additional clarifying amendments to certain provisions.
On April 27, 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Third Amendment") which provided for additional financing consisting of the 2023 Dollar Term Facility. The full amount of the 2023 Dollar Term Facility was drawn on June 6, 2023 (the "Third Amendment Closing Date"), and the proceeds were primarily used to finance the repurchases of the Series A Preferred Stock as part of the Transaction, and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with this amendment. 
The 2023 Dollar Term Facility will mature on April 30, 2028. Prior to maturity, the 2023 Dollar Term Facility will be repaid quarterly in an amount equal to, during the first 
two years
 occurring after the Third Amendment Closing Date, 
7.50
% per annum of the aggregate principal amount, and thereafter, 
10.00
% per annum. The Company may prepay the 2023 Dollar Term Facility at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to certain exceptions (including for (i) customary breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of term benchmark rate loans and (ii) certain repricing events occurring during the period from the Third Amendment Closing Date to the date that is 
twelve months
 following the Third Amendment Closing Date).
The Third Amendment also provided for (i) a further increase in the maximum borrowing amount under the Revolving Facility by $
95
 million (the “Incremental Revolving Commitment”) to an aggregate amount of $
570
 million; and (ii) an extension of the maturity date for the Revolving Facility by 
two years
 from April 30, 2026 to April 30, 2028 (or January 30, 2028 if any of the currently outstanding term loans or term loans under the 2023 Dollar Term Facility maturing as of April 30, 2028 remain outstanding as of such date). The Incremental Revolving Commitment has the same terms and is generally subject to the same conditions applicable to the existing revolving facility under the Credit Agreement, except for fees paid in connection with the arrangement of the increased amount.
On May 21, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 4 (the "Fourth Amendment") and Amendment No. 5 (the "Fifth Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment (i) removed the credit spread adjustment with respect to certain US dollar denominated term loan borrowings that are Term Benchmark Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (ii) reduced the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on certain US dollar denominated term loans to 
2.75
% for Term Benchmark Loans and 
1.75
% for ABR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
The Fifth Amendment increased the amount of revolving loan commitments available to the Company under the Credit Agreement by $
30
 million ("Incremental Revolving Commitment") to an aggregate amount of $
600
 million, as discussed below. The Incremental Revolving Commitment has the same terms and is subject to the same conditions applicable to revolving loans generally under the Credit Agreement.
Security
The Credit Facilities are secured on a first-priority basis by: (i) a perfected security interest in the equity interests of each direct material subsidiary of each guarantor under the Credit Facilities and (ii) perfected security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material real property of each of the guarantors under the Credit Facilities, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions and limitations, including the agreed guaranty and security principles. The guarantors organized under the laws of England and Wales, Luxembourg, 
73

Switzerland and the United States entered into security documents securing the obligations of each borrower concurrently with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement. The guarantors organized under the laws of Australia, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Romania and Slovakia have subsequently executed security documents.
Interest Rate and Fees
The 2032 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 
7.75
% per annum. Interest on the 2032 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 31 and November 30 of each year, commencing on November 30, 2024.
The 2021 Dollar Term Facility is subject to an interest rate, at our option, of either (a) an alternate base rate (“ABR”) (which shall not be less than 
1.50
%) or (b) an adjusted SOFR rate ("SOFR") (which shall not be less than 
0.50
%), in each case, plus an applicable margin equal to 
2.75
% in the case of SOFR loans and 
1.75
% in the case of ABR loans. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Revolving Facility is subject to an interest rate comprised of an applicable benchmark rate (which shall not be less than 
1.00
% if such benchmark is the ABR rate and not less than 
0.00
% in the case of other applicable benchmark rates) that is selected based on the currency in which borrowings are outstanding thereunder, in each case, plus an applicable margin that may vary based on our leverage ratio.  
Accordingly, the interest rates for the Credit Facilities will fluctuate during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR and other applicable benchmark rates or future changes in our leverage ratio. Interest payments with respect to the Term Loan Facilities are required either on a quarterly basis (for ABR loans) or at the end of each interest period (for SOFR loans) or, if the duration of the applicable interest period exceeds three months, then every 
three months
. 
In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility, which is determined by our leverage ratio and ranges from 
0.25
% to 
0.50
% per annum.
Prepayments
2032 Senior  Notes
The Issuers may redeem some or all of the 2032 Senior Notes at its option prior to May 31, 2027, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2032 Senior Notes redeemed, plus a customary "make-whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest excluding, the redemption date.
At any time prior to May 31, 2027, the Issuers may also redeem up to 
40
% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Senior Notes with funds in an aggregate amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 
107.750
% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest. The issuers may redeem the 2032 Senior Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the following redemption prices:
•
from May 31, 2027 to May 30, 2028: Redemption Price equal to 
103.875
% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest;
•
from May 31, 2028 to May 30, 2029: Redemption Price equal to 
101.938
% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest; and
•
from May 31, 2029 and Thereafter: Redemption Price equal to 
100
% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest
Additionally, the Issuers may redeem all, but not part, of the 2032 Senior Notes upon the occurrence of specified tax events as described in the indenture. 
Term Loans
The Company is obligated to make quarterly principal payments throughout the term of the 2021 Dollar Facility and the 2023 Dollar Term Facility according to the amortization provisions in the Credit Agreement. Such payments may be reduced from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement as a result of the application of loan prepayments made by us, if any, prior to the scheduled date of payment thereof.
We may voluntarily prepay borrowings under the Credit Agreement without premium or penalty, subject to a 
1.00
% prepayment premium in connection with certain repricing events in connection with the 2023 Dollar Term facility during 
74

the period from the Third Amendment Closing Date to the date that is twelve months following the Third Amendment Closing Date and customary "breakage” costs with respect to SOFR and EURIBOR loans. We may also reduce the commitments under the Revolving Facility, in whole or in part, in each case, subject to certain minimum amounts and increments. 
The Credit Agreement also contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions in the event that we incur certain types of indebtedness, receive net cash proceeds from certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property or, starting with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2022, 
0.50
% of excess cash flow on an annual basis (with step-downs to 
25
% and 
0
% subject to compliance with certain leverage ratios), in each case subject to terms and conditions customary for financings of this kind.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company made an early repayment in the amount of $
200
 million on the 2023 Dollar Term Facility. The early repayment resulted in incremental amortization on debt issuance cost of $
9
 million, included within Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we made early debt repayments totalling $
985
 million on our Euro Term Facility and our 2023 Dollar Term Facility. Both term loans were fully repaid as of December 31, 2024. The early repayments resulted in incremental amortization of debt issuance costs of $
27
 million, included within Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Representations and Warranties
The Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to certain agreed qualifications) that are customary for financings of this kind.
Certain Covenants
2032 Senior Notes
The 2032 Senior Notes contain certain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt, incur certain liens securing debt, pay certain dividends or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, make certain asset sales, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the 2032 Senior Notes indenture. Additionally, the indenture contains certain change of control provisions that, under certain conditions, would require the Company to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding 2032 Senior Notes at a price equal to 
101
% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture also contains customary events of default.
Term Loans
The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financing of this type. The Revolving Facility also contains a financial covenant requiring the maintenance of a consolidated total leverage ratio of not greater than 
4.7
 times as of the end of each fiscal quarter if, on the last day of any such fiscal quarter, the aggregate amount of loans and letters of credit (excluding backstopped or cash collateralized letters of credit and other letters of credit with an aggregate face amount not exceeding $
30
 million) outstanding under the Revolving Facility exceeds 
35
% of the aggregate commitments thereunder. Recent changes in our term loan are discussed in Note 29, 
Subsequent Events
.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all its financing covenants.
Note 17. Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Preferred Stock

834,800,000
 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Honeywell in satisfaction of certain claims of Honeywell.

Note 19. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures
Credit and Market Risk
76

We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates. These exposures may impact future earnings and/or operating cash flows. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. 
We hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward contracts. The forward currency exchange contracts are intended to mitigate exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility and the associated impact on earnings related to forecasted foreign currency commitments. Certain of these forward currency exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, whereby the gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in AOCI until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding designated and undesignated forward currency exchange contracts with aggregate gross notional amounts of $
928
 million and $
1,171
 million, respectively, to hedge foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Euro, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, New Romanian Leu, Czech Koruna, Australian Dollar and Korean Won. 
The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk on its 2032 Senior Notes. The cross-currency swap contract is designated as a cash flow hedge, with changes in the fair value of the derivative recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings based upon changes in the spot rate remeasurement of the underlying debt. The Company also uses cross-currency swap contracts to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These cross-currency swap contracts are designated as net investment hedges, and the gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in AOCI until the net investment is liquidated or sold. 
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company is also exposed to market value risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate term loan debt. To manage interest rate exposure, the Company enters into interest rate swap contracts. Certain of these interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, whereby the gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in AOCI until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The FASB’s accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Cash Flow Hedges
During 2023, the Company entered into float-to-fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $
200
 million and maturities in July 2024 and October 2024. The Company also entered into a float-to-fixed cross-currency swap contract comprised of an amortizing swap with an aggregate notional amount of €
280
 million ($
300
 million) and notional exchanges in June 2026, June 2027, and June 2028. The interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts were early settled in 2024, resulting in net gains of $
18
 million recorded to Interest expense and a $
4
 million loss recorded to Non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
The Company also has outstanding forward currency exchange contracts with maturities up to 
18
 months and an aggregate notional amount of $
331
 million and $
456
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These forward currency exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposures primarily on our inventory purchases and manufacturing costs. The gains and losses on the forward currency exchange contracts are recorded in AOCI and reclassified to Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Operations when the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings.
In order to mitigate foreign currency risk on its 2032 Senior Notes, the Company entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of €
507
 million ($
550
 million) and notional exchanges in May 2027, May 2028, May 2029 and May 2030. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap contracts are recognized in AOCI and reclassified to Non-operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, based upon changes in the spot rate remeasurement of the underlying debt. The net interest settlements on the cross-currency swap contract are recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
All of the Company’s cash flow hedges are assessed as highly effective. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a loss of $
8
 million, net of tax, and a loss of $
15
 million, net of tax, respectively, in Other comprehensive income.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company has designated cross-currency swaps with an aggregate notional amount of €
858
 million ($
965
 million) and €
615
 million ($
715
 million) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as net investment hedges of the Company’s Euro-denominated operations. In April 2024, the Company re-couponed the cross-currency swap contracts and 
78

received a cash settlement of $
13
 million. The fair values of the net investment hedges were net assets of $
70
 million and $
37
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income includes Changes in fair value of net investment hedges, net of tax, of a $
49
 million gain and a $
9
 million loss for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 
No
 ineffectiveness has been recorded on the net investment hedges.
Non-Designated Derivatives
As of December 31, 2024  and 2023, the Company has outstanding float-to-fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of €
450
 million ($
470
 million) and €
830
 million ($
917
 million), respectively, and maturities of April 2025, April 2026 and April 2028. Changes in the fair value of the undesignated interest rate swap contracts are recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded losses of $
37
 million and $
33
 million, respectively, in Interest expense. 
The Company also has outstanding forward currency exchange contracts with maturities generally up to 
3
 months and an aggregate notional amount of $
597
 million and $
715
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments and are adjusted to fair value through Non-operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a gain of $
12
 million and a loss of $
8
 million, respectively, in Non-operating income.
Fair Value Measurement
The foreign currency exchange, interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts are valued using market observable inputs. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2. The assumptions used in measuring fair value of the cross-currency swap contracts are considered Level 2 inputs, which are based upon market observable interest rate curves, cross currency basis curves, credit default swap curves, and foreign exchange rates. 
The carrying value of Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, Account receivables and Notes and Other receivables contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value. 
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value:

Note 21. Equity
Series A Preferred Stock
On April 30, 2021, in connection with the Emergence, the Company issued 
247,757,290
 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock to affiliated funds of Centerbridge, affiliated funds of Oaktree (together with Centerbridge, the "C&O Investors"), and certain other investors and parties.
On April 12, 2023 (the “Transaction Date”), the Company entered into separate definitive agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Centerbridge and Oaktree to effect a series of integrated transactions (collectively, the “Transaction”) designed to simplify the Company’s capital structure by converting all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into a single class of Common Stock, subject to certain conditions.
Under the terms of the Agreements, the Company agreed to purchase a total of $
570
 million in shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock from the C&O Investors at a cash price per share to be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock for the 
fifteen
 trading days following the announcement of the transactions (the “
15
 Days VWAP”), subject to a minimum price of $
7.875
 per share and a maximum price of $
8.50
 per share. The 
15
 Days VWAP was subsequently established at a value of $
8.177
 per share. 
Additionally, under the terms of the Agreements, all holders of Series A Preferred Stock, including the C&O Investors, were entitled to receive (i) $
0.853509
 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, representing accumulated and unpaid preference dividends through June 30, 2023 on each share of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Accumulated Dividends”), which would be paid out in shares of Common Stock valued at the 
15
 Days VWAP, and (ii) $
0.144375
 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, representing the preference dividends that would have accrued on the Series A Preferred Stock through September 30, 2023 (the “Additional Amounts”), which would be paid out in cash.
In the second quarter of 2023, the Company completed the following steps in connection with the Transaction:
•
The Company issued 
25,577,517
 shares of Common Stock to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of the Accumulated Dividends, with immaterial cash payments made in lieu of issuing fractional shares;
•
The Company paid approximately $
35
 million in aggregate to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of the Additional Amounts, consisting of $
10
 million to the C&O Investors in consideration of shares to be repurchased and $
25
 million to all holders in consideration of shares to be converted, which Additional Amounts were considered to be a deemed dividend;
•
The Company repurchased 
69,707,719
 shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the C&O Investors at the 
15
 Days VWAP for an aggregate purchase price of $
570
 million; and 
•
The remaining 
175,337,712
 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into 
175,337,712
 shares of Common Stock, and trading of the Series A Preferred Stock on Nasdaq was subsequently suspended.
80

The Agreements were accounted for as freestanding physically settled forward purchase contracts. The Agreements were initially recorded at fair value and then remeasured through earnings until the establishment of the 
15
 Days VWAP, whereupon the Agreements were subsequently measured based on the amount of consideration to be paid at settlement. A Monte-Carlo simulation model was used to determine the Transaction Date fair value of the Agreements by simulating a range of possible future stock prices for the Company through the expected settlement date of the Agreements. The significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of the Agreements include: (i) a dividend yield of 
0.0
%; (ii) an expected volatility of 
40.0
%; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 
4.23
% based on observed interest rates from the Treasury Constant Maturity yield curve consistent with the simulation term; and (iv) a starting share price of $
8.25
 based on the market price of the Common Stock as of the Transaction Date. 
The initial fair value of the Agreements represented a forward purchase liability of $
4
 million. A loss of $
13
 million was recognized in Non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations to reflect the subsequent remeasurement of fair value of the Agreements due to changes in the market price of the Company’s Common Stock. The difference between the fair value of consideration transferred under the Agreements and the carrying value of the repurchased Series A Preferred Stock, amounting to $
201
 million, was recorded to Retained Deficit as a deemed dividend on the repurchase of Series A Preferred Stock from the C&O Investors as part of the Transaction. A liability for excise tax, amounting to $
6
 million, was also recorded to Retained Deficit as a deemed dividend.

Treasury Stock
Treasury stock represents shares of the Company's Common Stock that have been issued and subsequently repurchased by the Company or withheld to satisfy withholding tax obligations in connection with equity award vestings, and that have not been retired or cancelled. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of Equity (Deficit) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company accounts for the

reissuance of treasury stock using the average cost method. The Company did not reissue or retire any shares of treasury stock during the year ended 
December 31, 2024.
Share Repurchase Program
On February 15, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a $
350
 million share repurchase program valid from February 13, 2024, until December 31, 2024. The Company may repurchase shares from time to time under the program through various methods, including in open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, and otherwise. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 
33,493,224
 shares of Common Stock for $
296
 million under the program. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock. The 2024 share repurchase program expired on December 31, 2024. On December 4, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new $
250
 million share repurchase program valid January 1, 2025 until December 31, 2025.

Note 23. Stock-Based Compensation
2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan
On May 25, 2021, the Garrett Motion Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Long-Term Incentive Plan”) was adopted. The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, restricted stock units, restricted stock, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards to employees and non-employee directors of Garrett or its affiliates, and independent contractors or consultants of Garrett. The maximum aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock that may be issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan is 
31,280,476
 shares. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of 
8,931,710
 shares of our Common Stock were awarded, net of forfeitures and 
22,348,766
 shares of our Common Stock were available for future issuance under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

RSUs
 are issued to certain key employees and directors at fair market value at the date of grant. RSUs typically vest over 
3
 to 
5
 years and when vested, each unit entitles the holder to 
one
 share of our Common Stock.

 years. 
Performance Stock Units ("PSUs")
As of 
December 31, 2024,

an aggregate of 
4,150,849
 PSU awards were granted to officers and certain key employees under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which, upon vesting, entitles the holder to shares of our Common Stock. The actual number of shares an employee receives for each PSU depends on the Company’s performance against various measures. 
For PSUs, the performance measures are based on Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, weighted 
50
% each, over a 
three-year
 performance period. The PSUs vest at levels ranging from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target level depending on the Company’s performance against the financial measures.
Additionally, certain PSUs were also granted in 2023 and 2024 that included a performance measure for relative total shareholder return (“rTSR”) with stock price hurdles measured over a 
three-year
 performance period. Each grantee is granted a target level of PSUs and may earn between 
0
% and 
200
% of the target level depending on the achievement of the rTSR. 
The awards associated with the rTSR performance measures are considered to have a market condition. A Monte-Carlo simulation model was used to determine the grant date fair value by simulating a range of possible future stock prices for the Company over the performance period. This model requires an input of assumptions including the simulation term, the risk-free interest rate, a volatility estimate for the Company’s shares, and a dividend yield estimate. The simulation term was the period of time between performance period start date and the performance end date. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on observed interest rates from the Treasury Constant Maturity yield curve consistent with the simulation term. The Company’s volatility estimate was based on the historical volatilities of peers over a historical period consistent with the simulation term. The dividend yield in the model is set to zero as recipients of the award are entitled to dividend equivalents on shares that vest.  
The fair value of the PSUs granted in 2023 and 2024 were estimated using the following assumptions:

The fair value of the TSR-based PSUs is based on the output of the Monte Carlo simulation model noted above and the PSUs not containing a market condition are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the grant date. The number of underlying shares to be issued will be based on actual performance achievement over the performance period.
The fair value of each PSU grant is amortized monthly into compensation expense on a graded vesting (accelerated) basis over a vesting period of 
36
 months. The accrual of compensation costs is based on our estimate of the final expected value of the award and is adjusted as required for the performance-based conditions. 
As of December 31, 2024, there was $
12
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
1.81
 years. 
Dividend Equivalents
All RSUs and PSUs granted contain rights that entitle the recipient of an award to a dividend equivalent in the amount and form equal to any dividends that would have been paid on the shares of Common Stock underlying the awards had such shares been outstanding on the record dates. Dividend equivalents are accrued on each award from the grant date until the award vests. The accrual is based on the dividends declared on the Company's Common Stock during the vesting period. The dividend equivalents are not paid out until the underlying award has vested and settled. The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting and settlement conditions as the awards. If the award does not vest, the accrued dividend equivalent is forfeited.

Note 24. Earnings Per Share
85

For the year ended December 31, 2024, basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, basic earnings per share was calculated using the two-class method because our Series A Preferred Stock was considered a participating security prior to its conversion into Common Stock and cancellation pursuant to the Transaction. The two-class method requires an allocation of earnings to all securities that participate in dividends with common shares, which included our Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that each security may share in the entity’s earnings. Basic earnings per share are then calculated by dividing undistributed earnings allocated to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 
Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2024 is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class or if-converted methods. The two-class method uses net income available to common shareholders and assumes conversion of all potential shares other than the participating securities. The if-converted method uses net income and assumes conversion of all potential shares including the participating securities. 
The details of the earnings per share calculations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

For the periods where a net loss attributable to common shareholders is present, dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as including them would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the weighted-average number of unvested RSUs and other contingently issuable shares excluded from the computations was 
1,490,117
 shares.
Note 25. Commitments and Contingencies
We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of our businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, product safety, environmental, health and safety, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters and various other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses based on a careful analysis of each matter. We identify below the individual proceedings where we believe a material loss is reasonably possible or probable, and we accrue for matters when we believe that losses are probable and the amount of the potential loss is reasonably estimable. It is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the potential loss. Accordingly, while we believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable 
86

and can be reasonably estimated, it is possible that adverse outcomes from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Securities Litigation
In 2020, various securities class action complaints were filed against Garrett Motion Inc. and certain current and former Garrett officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting claims under Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for alleged securities fraud and control person liability. In March 2022, the trial court dismissed with prejudice the claims against certain of the defendants, and in March 2023, the trial court dismissed with prejudice all remaining claims. In April 2023, the plaintiffs appealed the trial court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In April 2024, the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of the claims, and the deadline for further appeals has passed.
Brazilian Tax Matters
In September 2020, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an infraction notice against Garrett Motion Industria Automotiva Brasil Ltda, challenging the use of certain tax credits (“Befiex Credits”) between January 2017 and February 2020. The infraction notice results in a loss contingency that may or may not ultimately be incurred by the Company. The estimated total amount of the contingency as of December 31, 2024, was $
21
 million, including penalties and interest. The Company believes, based on management’s assessment and the advice of external legal counsel, that it has meritorious arguments in connection with the infraction notice and any liability for the infraction notice is currently not probable. Accordingly, no accrual has been taken at this time.
Warranties and Guarantees
In the normal course of business, we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale to the customer. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in Accrued liabilities and Other Liabilities. 
The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees.

Note 26. Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We sponsor several funded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit plan. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans in Switzerland and Ireland. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.

The discount rates for the pension plans reflect the current rates at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of 
December 31, 2024
. To determine the discount rates, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. 
For both our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, we estimate the service and interest cost components of net period benefit (income) cost by utilizing a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. 
For non-U.S. benefit plans, actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.
The following amounts relate to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets.

Our U.S. pension asset investment strategy focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve market exposure and diversification on a risk adjusted basis. Our target allocations are as follows: 
91
% liability-hedging fixed income investments, 
8
% global equity securities, and 
1
% real estate investments. Fixed income investments include corporate and government issues with a target duration close to that of the plan liability. Global equity securities include mutual funds that invest in companies located both inside and outside the United States. The real estate fund invests in real estate investment trusts – companies that purchase office buildings, hotels and other real estate property.

Our assets are reviewed on a daily basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.
Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.

Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. We were not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plan in 2024. In 2024, contributions of $
5
 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2025, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $
5
 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.
Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Note 27. Segments and Concentrations
The Company has identified our CODM as the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM reviews consolidated net income when assessing the Company's performance, allocating resources and establishing management's compensation. In addition to consolidated net income, the CODM receives discrete information for net sales by product and by geographical location. Consolidated net income is used to monitor budget versus actual results. 
The accounting policies of our operating segment are the same as those described in the Company's summary of significant accounting policies.
The Company derives revenues from customers through sales of air and fluid compression and high-speed electric motor technologies for OEMs and distributors within the mobility and industrial space. In addition to consolidated net income, the CODM regularly reviews sales by region and product line.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company’s periodic reports. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on management's evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.
