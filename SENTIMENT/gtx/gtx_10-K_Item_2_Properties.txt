We have created a geographic footprint that emphasizes locating R&D, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in close physical proximity to our customers, thereby enabling us to manage our environmental footprint and to adopt technologies and products for the specific vehicle types sold in each geographic market. Over the past several years, we have invested heavily to be close to our Chinese, Indian and other high-growth region OEM customers to be able to offer world-leading technologies, localized engineering support and unparalleled manufacturing productivity.
As of December 31, 2024, we owned or leased 13 manufacturing sites, five R&D centers and nine close-to-customer engineering sites. We also have many smaller sales offices, warehouses, cybersecurity and integrated vehicle health management sites and other investments strategically located throughout the world. The following table shows the ownership and regional distribution of our manufacturing sites, R&D centers and customer engineering sites:
