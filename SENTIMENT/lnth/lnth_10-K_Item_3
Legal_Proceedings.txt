CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, prospects and industry estimates, are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements identify prospective information and can generally be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “can,” “commitment,” “could,” “designed,” “estimates,” “expects,” “generate,” “impact,” “increasing,” “hopes,” “intends,” “launch,” “likely,” “long-term,” “maintain,” “may,” “pipeline,” “plans,” “potential,” “predict,” “remain,” “seek,” “should,” “sustain,” “target,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions, or by express or implied discussions regarding potential acquisitions, collaborations, development and commercialization plans described in this Form 10-K, or regarding potential future revenues and expenses related to such acquisitions, collaborations, development and commercialization plans. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements we make relating to our outlook and expectations including, without limitation, in connection with: 
•
Continued market expansion and penetration for our established commercial products, particularly PYLARIFY and DEFINITY, in a competitive environment, and our ability to clinically and commercially differentiate our products;
•
Our ability to have third parties manufacture our products and our ability to manufacture DEFINITY in our in-house manufacturing facility, in amounts and at the times needed;
•
The availability of raw materials, key components, and equipment, either used in the production of our products and product candidates, or in the use by healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) of our products and product candidates, including, but not limited to positron emission tomography (“PET”) scanners PYLARIFY, MK-6240 and NAV-4694;
•
Our ability to satisfy our obligations under our existing clinical development partnerships using MK-6240 or NAV-4694 as a research tool and under the license agreements through which we have rights to MK-6240 and NAV-4694, and to further develop and commercialize MK-6240 and NAV-4694 as approved products, including the timing for any potential regulatory submissions for these investigational assets;
•
Our ability to successfully secure necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals relating to potential acquisitions, including of Life Molecular Imaging Ltd. (“Life Molecular”) and Evergreen Theragnostics, Inc. (“Evergreen”), the time and expense involved in seeking to secure those approvals, potential disruption to our business operations or those of the companies we plan to acquire while the acquisitions are pending or as a result of regulatory requirements related to the acquisitions and potential disruption to operations and productivity during the integration process after necessary approvals are secured and the potential that we are unable to integrate and realize the anticipated benefits that each acquisition is predicted to bring;
•
Our strategies, future prospects, and our projected growth, including revenue related to our collaboration agreements with POINT Biopharma Global Inc. (“POINT”), including our ability to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for PNT2002 and PNT2003 and to be successful in the patent litigation associated with PNT2003;
•
Our ability to successfully realize the anticipated benefits of our 2024 transactions with Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (“Perspective”);
•
The cost, efforts and timing for clinical development, regulatory approval, adequate coding, coverage and payment, and successful commercialization of our product candidates and new clinical applications and territories for our products, in each case, that we or our strategic partners may undertake; and
•
Our ability to identify opportunities to collaborate with strategic partners and to acquire or in-license additional diagnostic and therapeutic product opportunities in oncology, neurology and other strategic areas and continue to grow and advance our pipeline of products.
Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, such statements are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. These statements are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. The matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K may not in fact occur. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, 
"Risk Factors"
 of this Form 10-K.
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS
Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to:
Risks Related to Our Portfolio of Commercial Products
•
Our ability to continue to grow PYLARIFY as a commercial product is dependent on (A) the ability of PET manufacturing facilities (“PMFs”) to manufacture PYLARIFY to meet product demand, or that PYLARIFY will always be available at the specific time of day preferred by the end-user, (B) our ability to maintain adequate coding, coverage, and payment for PYLARIFY, (C) our ability to promote PYLARIFY to customers and to maintain PYLARIFY as the most utilized prostate-specific membrane antigen (“PSMA”) PET imaging agent, including after the expiration of transitional pass-through payment status (“TPT Status”) at the end of 2024, (D) whether and when a potential generic version of PYLARIFY may enter the market and (E) our ability to clinically and commercially differentiate PYLARIFY from other products.
•
Our ability to continue to (A) grow the appropriate use of DEFINITY in suboptimal echocardiograms in a competitive environment, (B) mitigate the risk of generic competition as a result of patent and regulatory exclusivity expirations, (C) maintain DEFINITY as the most utilized ultrasound enhancing agent, and (D) have third parties manufacture our products and our ability to manufacture DEFINITY in our in-house manufacturing facility.

Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions, including of Life Molecular and Evergreen, including the potential for unforeseen expenses related to integration activities, the accuracy of our financial models, the potential for unforeseen liabilities within those businesses, the ability to integrate disparate information technology systems, retain key talent and create a merged corporate culture that successfully realizes the full potential of the combined organization.
•
Our ability to introduce new products and adapt to an evolving technology and medical practice landscape.
