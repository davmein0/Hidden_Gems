Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In November 2024, our Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $250 million of our common stock during the next twelve months (the “2024 Program”). Such repurchases may be made from time to time via open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The actual timing, number and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by our management, in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the market price of our common stock.
The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, adopted by us on June 24, 2015, as amended on April 26, 2016 and as further amended on April 27, 2017, April 24, 2019, April 28, 2021, April 28, 2022, April 25, 2024 and October 22, 2024 (the “2015 Plan”), provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations. It does not specify a maximum number of shares that can be withheld for this purpose. The shares of common stock withheld to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item 5.

Overview
Our Business
We are the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company, delivering life-changing science to enable clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes. We classify our products in three categories: Radiopharmaceutical Oncology, Precision Diagnostics, and Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue. Our leading Radiopharmaceutical Oncology products help healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) Find, Fight and Follow cancer. Our leading Precision Diagnostic products assist HCPs to Find and Follow diseases, with a focus in cardiology. Our Strategic Partnerships include biomarkers and digital solutions in support of our partners’ therapeutic development, out-licensing agreements for non-core assets and optimization of our assets geographically.
Our commercial products are used by cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, nuclear medicine physicians, oncologists, radiologists, sonographers, technologists, and urologists working in a variety of clinical settings. We believe that our diagnostic products provide information that enables HCPs to better detect and characterize, or rule out, disease, with the potential to achieve better patient outcomes, reduce patient risk and limit overall costs.
We produce and market our products throughout the United States (the “United States” or “U.S.”), selling primarily to hospitals, independent diagnostic testing facilities, and radiopharmacies. We sell our products outside the U.S. through a combination of direct distribution in Canada and third party distribution relationships in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia-Pacific, Central America and South America.
Our executive offices are located in Bedford, Massachusetts, with additional offices in North Billerica, Massachusetts; Montreal, Canada; and Lund, Sweden.
Recent Developments
During 2024, we executed on our strategy to evolve into a fully integrated radiopharmaceutical company, supported by our increasingly diversified portfolio and our targeted initiatives to expand our pipeline, commercial, development and manufacturing capabilities. Over the course of the year and into 2025, we announced multiple strategic transactions, which furthered our goal to focus on new high growth markets and expand and diversify our capabilities and development pipeline with complementary assets. A brief description of these transactions is summarized below.
Pending Acquisition of Life Molecular Imaging
On January 13, 2025, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Life Molecular Imaging Ltd. (“Life Molecular”). Life Molecular is based in Berlin, Germany and is dedicated to advancing novel PET radiopharmaceutical diagnostics. The definitive agreement provides for an upfront payment of $350.0 million and up to an additional $400.0 million in potential earn-out and milestone payments. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary regulatory and closing conditions. 
Previously, on July 3, 2024,we acquired from Life Molecular the global rights to its clinical stage RM2, a gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (“GRPR”)-targeting agent, including the associated novel, clinical-stage radiotherapeutic and radiodiagnostic pair, previously referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-RM2 and 68Ga-DOTA-RM2 (and which we now refer to as LNTH-2402 and LNTH-2401, respectively), for an upfront payment of $35.0 million plus a $1.0 million payment made prior to the acquisition, and potential regulatory milestone payments plus royalties (the “RM2 Asset Purchase”). GRPR is a member of the bombesin G protein-coupled receptor family, which has been found to be overexpressed in multiple cancers, including prostate, breast and lung. First-in-human dosimetry showed a favorable safety and dosimetry profile and confirmed preclinical data demonstrating dose-dependent efficacy of LNTH-2402. We intend to begin a Phase 1/2a study with LNTH-2402 in prostate cancer patients in 2025. We expect LNTH-2401 could be used as a companion diagnostic, and that together, LNTH-2401 and LNTH-2402 could potentially allow us to enter into new disease areas.

Pending Acquisition of Evergreen Theragnostics
On January 27, 2025, we announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Evergreen Merger Agreement”) with Evergreen Theragnostics, Inc. (“Evergreen”) and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we will acquire Evergreen by means of a statutory merger of our subsidiary with and into Evergreen, with Evergreen surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Evergreen Merger”). Evergreen is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical company engaged in contract development and manufacturing services, as well as drug discovery and commercialization of proprietary products. 
Pursuant to the Evergreen Merger Agreement, we will pay an upfront amount of $250 million, payable in cash at closing and subject to customary adjustments as set forth in the Evergreen Merger Agreement, and milestone payments in an aggregate additional cash amount of up to $752.5 million upon the occurrence of certain Milestone Trigger Events (as set forth in the Evergreen Merger Agreement). We also agreed to provide up to $18 million in unsecured loans to Evergreen on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Evergreen Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary regulatory and closing conditions. 
Acquisition of NAV-4694
On June 18, 2024, we acquired Meilleur Technologies Inc. (“Meilleur”), including its asset NAV-4694, a late-stage investigational F-18-positron emission tomography (“PET”) imaging agent that targets beta amyloids in Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid the stockholders of Meilleur (“Meilleur Stockholders”) an upfront payment of $32.9 million and paid an additional $10.0 million in August 2024 after the successful completion of a technology transfer. We could pay additional milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. regulatory milestones related to NAV-4694. We could also pay double-digit milestone payments upon achievement of specified annual commercial sales and double-digit royalty payments for research revenue and commercial sales. Research revenue is derived from partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that use NAV-4694 in clinical trials. NAV-4694 is currently in Phase 3 development and is also being used in academic and industry sponsored clinical trials. We expect to submit an NDA for NAV-4694 in 2026.

Exclusive License for Radiopharm Theranostics Limited
On June 15, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Radiopharm to acquire global, exclusive rights to two licensed preclinical assets for an upfront payment of $2.0 million (the “Radiopharm Asset Purchase”). We acquired global, exclusive rights to both a monoclonal antibody that targets LRRC15, a preclinical therapeutic candidate targeting osteosarcoma, and a Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (“TROP2”)-targeted nanobody, a preclinical stage therapy. In connection with this acquisition, we are assuming the underlying license agreements related to the two preclinical assets, together with their respective milestone and royalty payment obligations.

Strategic Agreements with Perspective Therapeutics, Inc.
On January 8, 2024, we entered into multiple strategic agreements with Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (“Perspective”), a radiopharmaceutical company that is pursuing advanced treatment applications for cancers throughout the body. Under the agreements, we obtained an option to exclusively license Perspective’s Pb212-VMT- ⍺-NET, a clinical stage alpha therapy in development for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, and an option to co-develop certain early-stage therapeutic candidates targeting prostate cancer using Perspective’s innovative platform technology for an aggregate upfront payment of $28.0 million in cash. 
On January 22, 2024, we purchased 56,342,355 shares of Perspective’s common stock (“Perspective Shares”) at a purchase price of $0.37 per share in a private placement transaction, for approximately $20.8 million in cash. We were also granted certain pro rata participation rights to maintain our ownership position in Perspective in the event that Perspective makes any public or non-public offering of any equity or voting securities, subject to certain exceptions.
On March 1, 2024, we transferred the fixed assets and associated lease of our Somerset, New Jersey facility (the “Somerset Facility”) to Perspective, and the parties entered into a transition services arrangement pursuant to which we provided certain services relating to final disposal of radioactive waste and certain other related services.

Table of Contents
On March 6, 2024, we purchased 60,431,039 Perspective Shares at a price of $0.95 per share. The total consideration for this additional purchase was approximately $57.4 million, resulting in Lantheus Alpha holding approximately 19.90% of the outstanding Perspective Shares (or 17.35% on a fully diluted basis) as of March 6, 2024.
On June 14, 2024, Perspective effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, after which we held 11,677,339 Perspective Shares.

"Acquisition of Assets"
 to our consolidated consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, 
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” 
of this Form 10-K.
Chief Executive Officer Transition
On March 1, 2024, Brian Markison, our then Chair of our Board of Directors (the “Board”), became our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Mary Anne Heino, retired as our CEO and became the Chair of our Board. As part of this leadership transition, Mr. Markison assumed the role of Executive Chair of the Board as of January 23, 2024 until the effectiveness of his CEO appointment in March, and Board Member Julie McHugh became Lead Independent Director.
Other Strategic Changes
As part of our evolution into a fully integrated radiopharmaceutical company, during 2024, we reviewed our current capabilities and skillsets and began implementing organizational changes deemed necessary to best position us to execute on our long-term strategy. These changes included transitioning approximately 60 employees out of the Company. In connection with these changes, we approved equity modifications that allowed grants of stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) issued to those impacted by this event to continue to vest in 2024 and 2025 with any unvested stock option and RSU grants as of December 31, 2025 to be cancelled. Total stockholder return awards granted to these individuals will continue to vest on their original vesting schedule but any shares issued will be issued in a pro-rated amount based on the time served during the performance period.
MK-6240
On February 6, 2023, we acquired Cerveau, which holds the rights under a license agreement to develop and commercialize MK-6240, an investigational late-stage F-18-labeled PET imaging agent that targets tau tangles in Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid the stockholders of Cerveau (“Cerveau Stockholders”) an upfront payment of $35.3 million in February 2023 and an additional $10.0 million in May 2023 upon the successful completion of a technology transfer. The Cerveau Stockholders are also eligible to receive additional development and commercial milestone payments. We will pay double-digit royalty payments for research revenue and commercial sales. Research revenue is derived from partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that use MK-6240 in clinical trials and includes milestone and dose-related payments. 
In September 2023, MK-6240 was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. In February 2024, we announced the inclusion of MK-6240 in the National Institute on Aging-sponsored study called CLARiTI that enables the consortium to use MK-6240 in its investigation of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The CLARiTI study will involve all 37 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers in the United States and will recruit 2,000 subjects and collect their imaging and blood-based biomarker data to generate etiologic profiles for cases of mixed dementia.
In 2024, we held a pre-NDA meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and we expect to submit an NDA for MK-6240 in 2025, but we can provide no assurance that we will meet that expected timeline, that our NDA will be accepted by the FDA, that MK-6240 will be approved by the FDA or, if approved, that we will be successful in commercialization.

Sale of RELISTOR Licensed Intangible Asset Associated with Net Sales Royalties
On August 2, 2023, we sold the right to our RELISTOR net sales royalties, which is classified as a licensed intangible asset (“RELISTOR royalty asset”), under our license agreement with Bausch Health Companies, Inc. (“Bausch”); we retained the rights to future sales-based milestone payments. We received an initial payment of approximately $98.0 million in connection with the sale and we have the right to receive an additional payment from the buyer of $5.0 million if worldwide net sales of RELISTOR in 2025 exceed a specified threshold. The additional payment would be recognized upon achievement of the specified threshold. Decreases of $63.6 million of license assets and $17.5 million of associated accumulated amortization, as well as a gain of $51.8 million were recorded as a result of the sale. No sales-based milestone payment was earned in 2024. In 2023, we earned a $15.0 million sales-based milestone payment as the net sales threshold (as defined in the license agreement with Bausch) was met.

Table of Contents
On August 15, 2023, we announced that we would discontinue the production and promotion of AZEDRA and wind down our Somerset Facility. We continued manufacturing AZEDRA during the first quarter of 2024, to provide doses of AZEDRA to then-current patients so they could complete their treatment regimen. No AZEDRA was manufactured after March 1, 2024, when we transferred the assets and associated sublease of our Somerset Facility to Perspective.

of this Form 10-K.
Amendment of Credit Facility
In December 2024, we amended our five-year revolving credit facility (as amended, the “2022 Revolving Facility”). The amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date from December 2, 2027 to December 19, 2029, increased the 2022 Revolving Facility from $350.0 million to $750.0 million and increased the additional amount that we may request to add to the increased revolving commitment by $350.0 million. The amendment also, among other things, (i) reduces the ranges of margins based on our Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2022 Revolving Facility) used to calculate interest for the revolving loans and (ii) reduces the maximum unused commitment fee from 0.35% per annum to 0.30% per annum. 
Key Factors Affecting Our Results
Our financial performance incorporates the results of our acquisition of Cerveau on February 6, 2023 and Meilleur on June 18, 2024. Our business and financial performance have been, and continue to be, affected by the following:
Continued Growth of PYLARIFY
PYLARIFY, an F-18-labeled PET imaging agent targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (“PSMA”), was approved by the FDA in May 2021 and commercially launched in the U.S. in June 2021. PYLARIFY is indicated for PET imaging of PSMA-positive lesions in patients with prostate cancer with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy and in patients with suspected recurrence based on elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. PYLARIFY is available through a diverse, multi-partner network of PET manufacturing facilities (“PMFs”), including both commercial and academic partners.
The successful growth of PYLARIFY is dependent on our ability to maintain PYLARIFY as the most utilized PSMA PET imaging agent in an increasingly competitive space. PYLARIFY’s competition includes two commercially available gallium-68-based PSMA imaging agents, an approved F-18-based PSMA imaging agent, and other non-PSMA-based imaging agents commonly referred to as conventional imaging. The potential for future generic entrants to the market due to the expiry of PYLARIFY’s new chemical entity exclusivity period in 2026 could also generate increased competition for PYLARIFY. We will continue to make investments necessary to drive PYLARIFY awareness and adoption. We believe that PYLARIFY currently has the largest dedicated field-based commercial team in the PSMA PET imaging agent space. Continued growth and revenue contribution from PYLARIFY will also depend on our ability to differentiate PYLARIFY in light of the loss of transitional pass-through payment status (“TPT Status”) and changes to Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) hospital outpatient payment, including through flexible and dependable access to PYLARIFY nationally, a best-in-class customer experience and through long-term strategic partnerships.
Our Healthcare Procedure Coding System code, which enables streamlined billing, went into effect as of January 1, 2022. In addition, from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024, PYLARIFY had TPT Status from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in the hospital outpatient setting, enabling traditional Medicare FFS to provide separate payment for PYLARIFY in addition to the payment for the PET/computed tomography (“CT”) procedure in that setting.
In November 2024, CMS released the final rule for its calendar year 2025 Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (the “CMS 2025 OPPS Rule”), which recognizes the value and need for broad access to diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals. The rule provides separate payment for those diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals with per day costs greater than $630 based on mean unit cost (“MUC”) for the approximately 20% of patients with traditional Medicare FFS insurance coverage who are treated in the hospital outpatient setting. Effective January 1, 2025, CMS is maintaining separate payment for PYLARIFY based on MUC, which is lower than the ASP-based payments that were made during TPT Status.
Our plan to successfully grow PYLARIFY includes conveying its commercial and clinical value, expanding its use in appropriate new patient populations, and through strategic partnerships and collaborations, including outside of the U.S. Internationally, we previously licensed exclusive rights to Curium to develop and commercialize piflufolastat F-18 in Europe, where it is being commercialized in the EU under the brand name PYLCLARI. We have entered into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies for the use of PYLARIFY in connection with their development of PSMA-targeted therapeutics. Additional information on these collaborations are described further under Part I, Item 1.

Table of Contents
In connection with the acquisition of Progenics in June 2020, we issued contingent value rights (”CVRs”) tied to the financial performance of PYLARIFY. We paid $99.6 million to the CVR holders during May 2023 in full satisfaction of our obligations under the CVRs.
Continued Growth of DEFINITY
We believe we will be able to increase use of DEFINITY through continued education of physicians and healthcare providers about the benefits of ultrasound enhancing agents in suboptimal echocardiograms. The U.S. market currently has three echocardiography ultrasound enhancing agents approved by the FDA; we estimate that DEFINITY will continue to hold at least an 80% share of the U.S. segment for ultrasound enhancing agents in echocardiography procedures.
As we continue to grow our microbubble platform, our activities include:
•
Expansion of Label

–
 In March 2024, we received FDA approval for our supplemental new drug application for the use of DEFINITY in pediatric patients with suboptimal echocardiograms. The FDA decision was based on usage data from three pediatric clinical trials conducted with DEFINITY.
•
Patents
 - We continue to actively pursue additional patents in connection with DEFINITY, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. for DEFINITY, we have Orange Book-listed method-of-use patents, as well as additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed.
Expansion of Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue
We continue to seek ways to further increase the overall value of our portfolio of products and product candidates. We are evaluating a number of different opportunities to collaborate, in-license or acquire additional products, product candidates, businesses and technologies to drive our future growth. In particular, with respect to our Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue category, we are focused on radiopharmaceutical diagnostic and therapeutic product opportunities in oncology, neurology, and other strategic areas that will complement our existing portfolio.
Our Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue category includes our Strategic Partnerships, Digital Solutions, and Biomarker Solutions businesses and is focused on enabling precision medicine with biomarkers and digital solutions. 
•
Strategic Partnerships
 – We seek to monetize our assets through our Strategic Partnerships business, which includes biomarkers and digital solutions in support of our partners’ therapeutic development, out-licensing agreements for non-core assets and optimization of our assets geographically. For example, we licensed the commercialization rights for piflufolastat F-18 in Europe to Curium, where it is now commercialized under the brand name PYLCLARI, and for flurpiridaz, which received FDA approval in 2024 under the brand name Flyrcado, to GE Healthcare Limited (“GE Healthcare”).
•
Digital Solutions
 – Our Digital Solutions are designed to enhance imaging value and the throughput, reproducibility and reliability of image analysis, as well as to inform treatment selection and response to therapy. We offer our Digital Solutions to HCPs for clinical use and to pharmaceutical companies for development purposes, and in some cases, we also obtain clinical imaging data that we may use to further develop artificial intelligence solutions
. 
Our Digital Solutions include artificial intelligence medical device software, such as aPROMISE and Automated Bone Scan Index (“aBSI”), both of which are FDA cleared and received a European Conformity Marking (“CE mark”).
•
Biomarker Solutions
 – We use our Biomarker Solutions business to offer our Biomarker and Microbubble Platforms to pharmaceutical companies to support their research and development of therapeutic drugs and devices. The strategic goal of our Biomarker Solutions business is to gain early access to innovation, de-risk the development, generate data, embed our technologies in the clinical ecosystem and establish the clinical utility of product candidates and research tools in our pipeline. Our biomarkers are intended to support patient selection and the monitoring of disease progression. For example, piflufolastat F-18 is currently being used by Curium Pharma and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in their respective prostate cancer therapeutic drug development programs, and was also used in the development of PNT2002. MK-6240 is a widely utilized tau PET tracer in Alzheimer’s disease studies with over 100 ongoing academic and industry sponsored clinical trials, many for late-stage therapeutic candidates. NAV-4694 is also being used in academic and industry sponsored clinical trials.
Inventory Supply & Third Party Suppliers
We obtain a substantial portion of our imaging agents from third-party suppliers. Jubilant HollisterStier (“JHS”) is currently a significant supplier of DEFINITY and our sole source manufacturer of NEUROLITE, CARDIOLITE and evacuation vials, the latter being an ancillary component for our TechneLite generators. Our manufacturing and supply agreement with JHS (the “JHS MSA”) runs through December 31, 2027 and can be further extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The JHS MSA requires us to

Table of Contents
purchase from JHS specified percentages of our total requirements for DEFINITY, as well as specified quantities of NEUROLITE, CARDIOLITE and evacuation vial products, each year during the contract term. Either party can terminate the JHS MSA upon the occurrence of certain events, including the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party.
In 2021, we completed the construction of a specialized in-house manufacturing facility at our North Billerica campus to produce DEFINITY. On February 22, 2022, we received FDA approval of our supplemental new drug application authorizing commercial manufacturing of DEFINITY at our new facility. We believe this investment provides supply chain redundancy, improved flexibility and reduced costs in a potentially more price competitive environment.
Radiopharmaceuticals are decaying radioisotopes with half-lives ranging from a few hours to several days. Radiopharmaceutical finished goods, such as doses of PYLARIFY, cannot be kept in inventory because of their limited shelf lives and are subject to just-in-time manufacturing, processing, and distribution, which takes place at multiple PMF manufacturing partner sites that produce and deliver doses for us across the U.S. Our TechneLite generators and Xenon-133 are manufactured at our facilities in North Billerica, Massachusetts.
Research and Development Expenses
To ensure we remain the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company, we have historically made and will continue to make substantial investments in new product development and lifecycle management for existing products, including: 
•
For PYLARIFY, we are conducting a clinical trial to determine whether PYLARIFY can detect the presence or absence of additional prostate cancer lesions in patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, as well as how it may change the patient’s intended management. We also continue to support investigator sponsored research with the potential to expand the clinical utility of PYLARIFY.
•
For PNT2002 and PNT2003, we were granted a license to exclusive worldwide rights (excluding certain countries) for $260.0 million in upfront payments during the fourth quarter of 2022 and will potentially make additional payments as described below. We also filed an ANDA for PNT2003 as described further in the section entitled 
“Exclusive License for PNT2002 and PNT2003”
 in Part I, Item 1. 
“Business - Other Notable Transactions” 
of this Form 10-K.
•
For MK-6240, we acquired the right to the investigational asset for an upfront payment of $35.3 million in February 2023 and an additional $10.0 million in May 2023 upon the successful completion of a technology transfer and will potentially make additional milestone and royalty payments. In 2024, we held a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and are expecting to submit an NDA for MK-6240 in 2025.
•
For NAV-4694, we acquired the rights to the investigational asset for an upfront payment of $32.9 million in June 2024 and an additional $10.0 million in August 2024 upon the successful completion of a technology transfer and will potentially make additional milestone and royalty payments.
•
For LNTH-1363S, in collaboration with Ratio Therapeutics LLC (previously Noria Therapeutics, Inc.), we completed a Phase 1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry in adult healthy volunteers. We initiated a Phase 1/2a study in patients in 2024.
•
For RM2, we acquired global rights for an upfront payment of $35.0 million plus a $1.0 million payment made prior to the acquisition, and will potentially make additional milestone and royalty payments. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2a study in prostate cancer patients in 2025.
•
For LRRC15 and TROP2, we acquired the rights to the preclinical assets and the underlying license agreements for $2.0 million and will potentially make additional milestone and royalty payments.
For more information on potential milestone and royalty payments related to the product candidates listed above, see Note 21, 
"Acquisition of Assets"
 to our consolidated consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, 
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” 
of this Form 10-K.
PNT2002
Under the terms of the PNT2002 License Agreement, we paid POINT Biopharma Global Inc. (“POINT”) an upfront cash payment of $250.0 million, and could pay up to an additional $281.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory milestones. POINT is also eligible to receive up to $1.3 billion in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual sales thresholds of PNT2002. In addition, after Lantheus Two achieves $500.0 million in cumulative gross profit, POINT is eligible to receive royalty payments of 20% of net sales of PNT2002. Prior to achieving that financial recoupment threshold, POINT is eligible to receive royalty payments of 20% on that portion of annual net sales of PNT2002 that generate annual gross profit in excess of specified levels.
PNT2003
64
Table of Contents
Under the terms of the PNT2003 License Agreement, we paid POINT an upfront payment of $10.0 million, and could pay up to an additional $34.5 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory milestones. POINT is also eligible to receive up to $275.0 million in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual sales thresholds of PNT2003. In addition, POINT is eligible to receive royalty payments of 15% of net sales of PNT2003.
Our investments in these additional clinical activities and lifecycle management opportunities will increase our operating expenses and impact our results of operations and cash flow, and we can give no assurances as to whether any of these clinical development candidates or lifecycle management opportunities will be successful.
Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue
Oncology
As we continue to pursue expanding our strategic partnerships, our Biomarker Solutions activities in oncology are designed to enable precision medicine using biomarkers and digital solutions that augment diagnostic productivity. For example, in prostate cancer, we collaborate with pharmaceutical companies by supplying them with piflufolastat F-18 for use in their therapeutic drug development programs. In addition, with respect to our microbubble platform, we collaborate with strategic partners to provide microbubbles to be used in combination with those partners’ devices currently under development.
flurpiridaz
In September 2024, GE Healthcare announced that it had received FDA approval of Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F-18) for coronary artery disease diagnosis.
Under a Collaboration and License Agreement, GE Healthcare has led the funding and development of flurpiridaz F-18, and has the global commercialization rights for it. We have the right to receive:
•    up to $60 million in regulatory and sales milestone payments,
•    tiered double-digit royalties on U.S. sales., and
•    mid-single digit royalties on sales outside of the U.S.
Generally, our costs in connection with the strategic partnerships relate to intellectual property, the supply of drug and other ancillary expenses and the benefits can include possible supply, milestone and royalty payments, additional intellectual property rights and strategic relationships. For flurpiridaz F-18, under the Collaboration and License Agreement, we retained ownership of all of the licensed intellectual property and bear the cost of patent prosecution and maintenance.

Comparison of the Periods Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Revenues
We classify our revenues into three product categories: Radiopharmaceutical Oncology, Precision Diagnostics, and Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue. Radiopharmaceutical Oncology consists of PYLARIFY and AZEDRA. In 2024, we discontinued the production of AZEDRA. Precision Diagnostics includes DEFINITY, TechneLite and other diagnostic imaging products. Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue primarily includes biomarkers and digital solutions in support of our partners’ therapeutic development, out-licensing agreements for non-core assets and optimization of our assets geographically, and includes revenue derived from the research use of MK-6420 and NAV-4694.
Revenues are summarized by product category on a net basis as follows:

The increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023, is primarily due to increased PYLARIFY and DEFINITY sales volume, as well as revenue generated from sales for investigational use of NAV-4694 and MK-6240. The increase is offset, in part, by a decrease in net sales royalties in 2024 primarily due to the sale of the rights to our RELISTOR royalty revenue asset in 2023. Net sales royalties related to RELISTOR were recorded in Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue prior to the sale.
Rebates and Allowances
Estimates for rebates and allowances represent our estimated obligations under contractual arrangements with third parties. Rebate accruals and allowances are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These rebates and allowances result from performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth, Medicaid rebate programs for our products, administrative fees of group purchasing organizations and certain distributor related commissions. The calculation of the accrual for these rebates and allowances is based on an estimate of the third-party’s expected purchases and the resulting applicable contractual rebate to be earned over a contractual period.
An analysis of the amount of, and change in, reserves for rebates and allowances is summarized as follows:

Gross Profit

The increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, is primarily due to an increase in PYLARIFY and DEFINITY sales volume in 2024 and the impairment of the AZEDRA intangible asset recorded in 2023. This is partially offset by a decrease in RELISTOR net royalty sales due to the sale of the rights to the royalties in 2023. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in field sales, marketing, and customer service functions. Other costs in sales and marketing expenses include the development and utilization of advertising and promotional material, professional services, market research, and sales meetings.
Sales and marketing expenses increased $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily driven by our investment in sales and marketing efforts in support of an expansion of our PYLARIFY sales force and supporting functions intended to support and expand adoption of PYLARIFY and pre-commercialization activities for certain product candidates.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive, finance, legal, information technology, and human resource functions. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses are professional fees for information technology services, external legal fees, consulting and accounting services, as well as bad debt expense, certain facility and insurance costs, including director and officer liability insurance.
General and administrative expenses increased $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period. This was primarily driven by an increase in investment in technology, primarily related to our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in 2024, higher stock compensation, increased employee-related costs, and higher professional fees primarily related to business development activity.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses relate primarily to the development of product candidates and costs related to our medical affairs, medical information and regulatory functions.
Research and development expenses increased $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily driven by in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) expense of $36.0 million related to the RM2 Asset Purchase, $2.0 million related to the Radiopharm Asset Purchase, and an upfront option payment of $28.0 million to Perspective. In addition, there was an increase in employee-related costs resulting from an increase in headcount and increased project costs, including MK-6240 research and development expenses. This increase was offset, in part, by a non-cash impairment charge in the prior year associated with an IPR&D asset of $15.6 million and lower clinical expenses related to our Phase 2 study we conducted for 1095, our PSMA-targeted iodine 131-labelled small molecule product candidate. 
Gain on Sale of Assets
Gain on sale of assets includes a $6.3 million gain resulting from the sale of the Somerset Facility to Perspective in March 2024. In addition, we recorded a $2.1 million gain on sale of assets in December 2024 related to the sale of a portion of our North Billerica campus.
Investment in Equity Securities - Net Unrealized Loss
Investments in equity securities - net unrealized loss increased $43.6 million in 2024. Each quarter our investments in equity securities of Radiopharm Theranostics Limited (“Radiopharm”) and Perspective, which were purchased in 2024, are revalued to market price. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded unrealized losses on the investments in Radiopharm and Perspective of $2.6 million and $41.0 million, respectively.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net decreased by $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the gain on sale of the RELISTOR licensed intangible asset associated with net sales royalties of $51.8 million recorded in 2023, for which there is no comparable amount in 2024. This is partially offset by a $17.2 million increase in interest income in 2024, as compared to 2023, due to higher average cash balances in 2024.

Income Tax Expense
Our effective tax rate for each reporting period is presented as follows:

Year Ended
December 31,
2024
2023
Effective tax rate
27.5%
20.5%
Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes and the valuation allowance established on the current year net unrealized loss on our investment in equity securities.
The increase in the effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily due to the valuation allowance established on the current year unrealized loss on our investment in equity securities, and a benefit recorded in 2023 related to our RELISTOR royalty asset, which resulted in additional net operating losses becoming available for utilization under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. There was no such comparable amount recorded in 2024.
In accordance with our accounting policy, the change in the tax liabilities, penalties and interest associated with our uncertain tax positions (net of any offsetting federal or state benefit) is recognized within income tax expense (benefit). Our uncertain tax positions include indemnified liabilities, in accordance with the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement entered into with Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) in 2008. Changes in the liability result in offsetting changes in the indemnification receivable. As these reserves change, adjustments are included in income tax expense while the offsetting adjustment is included in other income. Assuming that the receivable from BMS continues to be considered recoverable by us, there will be no effect on net income and no net cash outflows related to these liabilities. During 2023, the Company released a significant portion of its indemnified liability due to the settlement of these positions in certain states at a cost significantly less than our accrual resulting in $5.2 million (net of federal or state benefit) income tax benefit. For more information see Note 5, 
“Income Taxes”

“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” 
of this Form 10-K.
Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the income tax benefits associated with stock compensation deductions, additional net operating losses available for utilization under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 as a result of the sale of our RELISTOR royalty asset, and the release of uncertain tax positions, partially offset by state income taxes.

 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities of $544.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items such as unrealized loss on investment in equity securities, charges incurred in connection with the Perspective IPR&D exclusive license options, charges related to Radiopharm’s licensed assets, charges related to Life Molecular’s RM2 license, gains on disposal of our Somerset Facility and a portion of our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and stock-based compensation expense. The primary working capital sources of cash is attributable to an increase in income taxes payable in 2024. The primary working capital uses of cash were due to the timing of payments to large vendors, an increase in trade receivables associated primarily with the increase in PYLARIFY revenues, and an increase in inventory related to the timing of batch processes.
Net cash provided by operating activities of $305.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for non-cash items such as impairment of long-lived assets, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense,

Table of Contents
gain on sale of our RELISTOR royalty asset, deferred income taxes, and stock-based compensation expense. The primary working capital sources of cash were the timing of payments to large vendors. The primary working capital uses of cash were a decrease to accruals related to the CVR payment, an increase in trade receivables associated primarily with the increase in PYLARIFY revenues, and an increase in inventory related to the timing of batch processes.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was driven by an upfront option payment of $28.0 million to Perspective, $36.0 million of payments for the RM2 Asset Purchase, $42.9 million payments to the Meilleur Stockholders for the acquisition of Meilleur, $2.0 million for the Radiopharm Asset Purchase, $83.2 million for the purchase of equity securities in Perspective and Radiopharm, and $51.6 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by net cash proceeds of $17.8 million from the sale of the Somerset Facility and a portion of our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, and associated assets.
Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to net cash proceeds of $97.8 million from the sale of our RELISTOR royalty asset offset by $45.3 million for our asset acquisition of Cerveau and $46.6 million of capital expenditures.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily attributable to the repurchase of our common stock for approximately $100.0 million, the payments for minimum statutory tax withholding related to net share settlement of equity awards of $22.6 million and the payment of $2.3 million of financing costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility described below, offset by proceeds of $6.7 million from stock option exercises.
Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to the payments for minimum statutory tax withholding related to net share settlement of equity awards of $14.4 million and the CVR initial valuation as of the acquisition date of $3.7 million, offset by proceeds of $3.8 million from stock option exercises.
External Sources of Liquidity
In December 2024, we entered into an amendment to the 2022 Revolving Facility that, among other things, extended the maturity date from December 2, 2027 to December 19, 2029, increased the 2022 Revolving Facility from $350.0 million to $750.0 million and increased the additional amount that LMI may request to add to the increased revolving commitment by $350.0 million. The amendment also, among other things, (i) reduces the ranges of margins based on our Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2022 Revolving Facility) used to calculate interest for the revolving loans and (ii) reduces the maximum unused commitment fee from 0.35% per annum to 0.30% per annum. The full terms of the 2022 Revolving Facility are set forth in the Credit Agreement, dated as of December 2, 2022, by and among us, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, as amended. We have the right to request an increase to the 2022 Revolving Facility or request the establishment of one or more new incremental term loan facilities, in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of $685.0 million (so that the total amount available is $1.44 billion) or 100% of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended, plus additional amounts, in certain circumstances.
Under the terms of the 2022 Revolving Facility, the lenders thereunder agreed to extend credit to us from time to time until December 19, 2029 consisting of revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $750.0 million at any time. The 2022 Revolving Facility includes a $40.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit (the “Letters of Credit”). The 2022 Revolving Facility includes a $20.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans (the “Swingline Loans”). The Letters of Credit, Swingline Loans and the borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Facility are expected to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
For more information on the 2022 Revolving Facility, see Note 12, 
“Long-Term Debt, Net, and Other Borrowings”
 to our consolidated consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, 
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” 
of this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement.
On December 8, 2022, we issued $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”), which includes $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes sold pursuant to the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional Notes. The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of December 8, 2022 (the “Indenture”), among the Company, LMI, as Guarantor, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (“U.S. Bank”), as Trustee. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $557.8 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and offering expenses payable by us.

On August 2, 2023, we sold the right to our RELISTOR royalty asset under our license agreement with Bausch; we retained the rights to future sales-based milestone payments. We received an initial payment of approximately $98.0 million in connection with the sale and have the right to receive an additional $5.0 million payment if worldwide net sales of RELISTOR in 2025 exceed a specified threshold. The additional payment would be recognized upon achievement of the specified threshold. Following such sale, we no longer receive tiered, sales-based royalties on worldwide net sales of RELISTOR related to the second quarter of 2023 and subsequent quarters.
In November 2024, our Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $250 million of our common stock during the next twelve months (the “2024 Program”). Such repurchases may be made from time to time via open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The actual timing, number and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by our management, in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative shares purchased under the 2024 Program were approximately 1.1 million shares for approximately $100.0 million.
Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements.
We may from time to time repurchase or otherwise retire our debt and take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our balance sheet. These actions may include prepayments of our term loans or other retirements or refinancing of outstanding debt, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amount of debt that may be retired, if any, could be material and would be decided at the sole discretion of our Board and will depend on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations.
Funding Requirements
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
The level of product sales and the pricing environment of our currently marketed products, particularly PYLARIFY and DEFINITY, as well as any additional products that we may market in the future;
•
Revenue mix shifts and associated volume and selling price changes that could result from additional competition or changes in customers’ product demand;
•
The continued costs of the ongoing commercialization of our products;
•
Our investment in the further clinical development and commercialization of products and development candidates, as well as whether we exercise our option and co-development rights under the Perspective agreements;
•
The costs of acquiring or in-licensing, developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, and commercializing, new products, businesses or technologies, including any potential related milestone or royalty payments, together with the costs of pursuing opportunities that are not eventually consummated;
•
The costs of investing in our facilities, equipment, and technology infrastructure; 
•
The costs and timing of establishing or amending manufacturing and supply arrangements for commercial supplies of our products and raw materials and components;
•
Our ability to have products manufactured and released from manufacturing sites in a timely manner in the future, or to manufacture products at our in-house manufacturing facilities in amounts sufficient to meet our supply needs;
•
The costs of further commercialization of our existing products, particularly in international markets, including product marketing, sales and distribution and whether we obtain local partners to help share such commercialization costs;
•
The legal costs relating to maintaining, expanding and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio, pursuing insurance or other claims and defending against product liability, regulatory compliance, intellectual property or other claims, including the patent infringement claim related to the filing of our ANDA for PNT2003;
•
The cost of interest on any additional borrowings which we may incur under our financing arrangements; and
•
The impact of sustained inflation on our costs of goods sold and operating expenses.

Disruption in our financial performance could occur if we experience significant adverse changes in product or customer mix, broad economic downturns, sustained inflation, adverse industry or company conditions or catastrophic external events, including pandemics, natural disasters and political or military conflict. If we experience one or more of these events in the future, we may be required to further implement expense reductions, such as a delay or elimination of discretionary spending in all functional areas, as well as scaling back select operating and strategic initiatives. 
If our capital resources become insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we would need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, assets securitizations, sale-leasebacks or other financing or strategic alternatives, to the extent such transactions are permissible under the covenants of our 2022 Credit Agreement. Additional equity or debt financing, or other transactions, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If any of these transactions require an amendment or waiver under the covenants in our 2022 Credit Agreement, which could result in additional expenses associated with obtaining the amendment or waiver, we will seek to obtain such an amendment or waiver to remain in compliance with those covenants. However, we cannot provide assurance that such an amendment or waiver would be granted, or that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
At December 31, 2024, our only current committed external source of funds is our borrowing availability under our 2022 Revolving Facility. We had $912.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024. Our 2022 Revolving Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative, reporting and financial covenants, in each case subject to certain exceptions and materiality thresholds. Incremental borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Facility may affect our ability to comply with the covenants including the financial covenants restricting consolidated net leverage and interest coverage. Accordingly, we may be limited in utilizing the full amount of our 2022 Revolving Facility as a source of liquidity.
Based on our current operating plans, we believe our balance of cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $912.8 million as of December 31, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to our 2022 Revolving Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next twelve months and beyond. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
Debt
We completed a sale of $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes due in 2027. As of December 31, 2024, we had no amounts of principal due within the next twelve months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $44.6 million, with $15.1 million payable within twelve months. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after December 22, 2025 if the closing sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the Notes for a specified period of time. For more information on our cash requirements under the Notes, see Note 12, 
“Long-Term Debt, Net, and Other Borrowings”
 to our consolidated consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, 
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” 
of this Form 10-K. 
Leases
We have operating lease arrangements for certain facilities, including corporate and manufacturing space. As of December 31, 2024, we had fixed operating lease payment obligations of $94.9 million, with $5.4 million payable within twelve months.
We have lease arrangements for certain equipment. As of December 31, 2024, we had fixed finance lease payment obligations of $1.8 million, with $1.0 million payable within twelve months.
Purchase Obligations
We have purchase obligations that primarily consist of noncancelable obligations related to minimum quantities of goods or services that have been committed to be purchased on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2024, we had minimum purchase obligations of $11.3 million, with $5.9 million due within twelve months.
License Agreements
We have entered into license agreements in which fixed payments have been committed to be paid on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2024, we had no amount of fixed license payments due within twelve months. These amounts do not include potential milestone or contractual payment obligations contingent upon the achievement or occurrence of future milestones or events under our license agreements, because they are contingent and the amounts and timing of such potential obligations are unknown or uncertain. We may be required to pay approximately $3.7 billion in contingent payments under our license agreements. 
Asset Acquisitions
During 2022, we entered into the POINT License Agreements, in which we made upfront payments of $260.0 million, and under which we may make additional milestone payments. The additional milestone payments are based on FDA approval and net sales and

commercial milestones. Under the terms of the PNT2002 License Agreement, we have the potential to pay up to an additional $281.0 million in milestone payments and up to $1.3 billion in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual sales thresholds. Under the terms of the PNT2003 License Agreement, we have the potential to pay an additional $34.5 million in milestone payments and up to $275.0 million in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual sales thresholds. In total, we may be required to pay up to approximately $1.8 billion related to the asset acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, these contingent payments were not expected to be payable due to the uncertainty around the timing of the future cash flows.
On February 6, 2023, we acquired Cerveau and made an upfront payment of approximately $35.3 million to the Cerveau Stockholders. We paid the Cerveau Stockholders an additional $10.0 million in May 2023 upon the successful completion of a technology transfer. We could pay up to an additional $51.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. regulatory milestones related to MK-6240. The Cerveau Stockholders are also eligible to receive up to $1.2 billion in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual commercial sales thresholds of MK-6240, as well as up to $13.5 million in research revenue milestones upon achievement of specified annual research revenue thresholds. Finally, we will pay to the Cerveau Stockholders up to double-digit royalty payments for research revenue and commercial sales. As of December 31, 2024, these contingent payments were not expected to be payable due to the uncertainty around the timing of the future cash flows.
On June 18, 2024, we acquired Meilleur, including its asset NAV-4694, an investigational F-18-labeled PET imaging agent that targets beta amyloids in Alzheimer’s disease. We made an upfront payment of approximately $32.9 million to the Meilleur Stockholders on June 18, 2024 and paid an additional $10.0 million in August 2024 after the successful completion of a technology transfer. We could pay up to an additional $43.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. regulatory milestones related to NAV-4694. The Meilleur Stockholders are also eligible to receive up to $830.0 million in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual commercial sales thresholds of NAV-4694 as well as up to $4.0 million in remaining research milestones upon achievement of specified clinical studies at academic institutions thresholds. Additionally, we could pay the Meilleur Stockholders up to double-digit royalty payments for research revenue and commercial sales. As of December 31, 2024, these contingent payments were not expected to be payable due to the uncertainty around the timing of the future cash flows.
For further information on possible funding requirements resulting from our asset acquisitions, see Note 21, 
"Acquisition of Assets"
 to our consolidated consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, 
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” 
of this Form 10-K.
Other Long-Term Liabilities
Our other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet include the fair values of contingent consideration liabilities including contingent consideration liabilities related to a previous acquisition completed by Progenics in 2013. We may be required to pay up to approximately $85.0 million related to the contingent consideration. As of December 31, 2024, these contingent payments were not expected to be payable within twelve months due to the uncertainty around the timing of the future cash flows. 
Our other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet include unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $7.3 million, which included interest and penalties, classified as noncurrent liabilities. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities.
Asset Retirement Obligation
We are required to provide the Massachusetts Department of Public Health financial assurance demonstrating our ability to fund the decommissioning of our North Billerica, Massachusetts production facility, upon closure. We have provided this financial assurance in the form of a $30.3 million surety bond (the “Surety Bond”). As of December 31, 2024, the liability for this decommissioning obligation, which was approximately $23.3 million, was measured at the present value of the obligation expected to be incurred of approximately $25.1 million. These contingent payments are not expected to be payable within twelve months due to the uncertainty around the timing of the future cash flows related to the decommissioning of our radioactive operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As noted above, we have provided the Surety Bond to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
Since inception, we have not engaged in any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including structured finance, special purpose entities, or variable interest entities.

Effects of Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our results of operations. We expect our cost of product sales and other operating expenses will change in the future in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels. Because we intend to retain and continue to use our property and equipment, we believe that the incremental inflation related to the replacement costs of those items will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and contract services, which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources. While we generally believe that we will be able to offset some of the effect of price-level changes by adjusting our product prices and implementing operating efficiencies, any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Recent Accounting Standards
Refer to Note 2, 
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,”
 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements located under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting standards that may have a significant impact on our business.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition, our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard.
We believe the following represent our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control over products or services to our customers. The amount of revenue we recognize reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy performance obligations.
We derive our revenues through arrangements with customers for product sales, as well as licensing and royalty arrangements. We sell our products primarily to hospitals, independent diagnostic testing facilities, and radiopharmacies, and we consider customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales or group purchasing organization agreements, to be contracts with our customers. In addition to these arrangements, we also enter into licensing agreements under which we license certain rights to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. We analyze various factors requiring management judgment when applying the five-step model to our contracts with customers.
Our product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which represents our sales price less estimates related to reserves which are established for items such as discounts, returns, rebates and allowances that may be provided for in certain contracts with our customers. Judgment is used in determining and updating our reserves on an ongoing basis, and where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates.
For our licensing and royalty arrangements, we use judgment in determining the number of performance obligations in a license agreement by assessing whether the license is distinct or should be combined with another performance obligation, as well as the nature of the license. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in a contract. These key assumptions may include market conditions, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, development timelines and probabilities of regulatory success.

Table of Contents
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. We recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. We assess the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed using a variety of methods. Each asset acquired and liability assumed is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates. Acquired IPR&D is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has an alternative future use. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on our estimates and assumptions, as well as other information we have compiled, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and assumptions used in these estimates, it could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, a required acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration, which would be expensed.
During the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, we may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as operating expenses or income.
Intangible and Long-Lived Assets
We test intangible and long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If those assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Any impairments are recorded as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets. Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets, that are held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell.
Intangible assets, consisting of trademarks, customer relationships, currently marketed products, licenses and developed technology are amortized in a method equivalent to the estimated utilization of the economic benefit of the asset.
Costs of IPR&D intangible assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Milestone payments made after regulatory approval are capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over an estimated useful life of the product. Cash payments related to acquired IPR&D intangible assets are reflected as an investing cash flow in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.
Our IPR&D intangible assets include intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility, regardless of whether they have alternative future use. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is whether we have obtained regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. Because obtaining regulatory approval can include significant risks and uncertainties, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D projects may vary from their fair value at the date of acquisition. We classify IPR&D intangible assets acquired in a business combination as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon completion of the associated research and development efforts, we will determine the useful life and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives. Upon permanent abandonment, we write-off the remaining carrying amount of the associated IPR&D intangible asset. We test our IPR&D intangible assets at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment and we recognize any impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may from time to time use derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge these economic exposures related to foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our 2022 Revolving Facility, which is variable rate indebtedness. Interest rate changes could increase the amount of our interest payments and thus negatively impact our future earnings and cash flows. As of 
75
Table of Contents
December 31, 2024, there was availability of $750.0 million on the 2022 Revolving Facility. Any increase in the interest rate under the 2022 Revolving Facility may have a negative impact on our future earnings to the extent we have outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Facility.
Foreign Currency Risk
We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we, or any of our subsidiaries, enter into transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our, or that subsidiary’s, functional currency. Intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us to foreign currency risk. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a loss of $0.7 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. From time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts primarily to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into additional foreign currency forward contracts when deemed appropriate. We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes.
The Canadian dollar presents the primary currency risk on our earnings. At December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would not have materially affected our financial instruments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lantheus Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lantheus Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue — Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s product revenue includes revenue earned from the sale of its prostate cancer positron emission tomography (“PET”) imaging agent, PYLARIFY. The Company recognizes revenue from PYLARIFY when it transfers control of promised goods to its customers. The Company’s principal customers for PYLARIFY sales include hospitals, independent imaging centers and government facilities. 
The accounting for PYLARIFY sales involves judgment, particularly as it relates to designing and executing the product distribution processes in a manner that provides the Company reliable information in determining when control of the product is transferred to the customer. For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue from the sale of PYLARIFY was $1.1 billion.
We identified revenue from the Company’s PYLARIFY sales as critical audit matter due to the high volume of transactions and the complexity of the product distribution processes. This required extensive audit effort and an increased level of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue from product sales included the following, among others:
78
Table of Contents
•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue from PYLARIFY sales, including controls over the quantity and price of products shipped and timing of revenue recognition.
•
For product shipped by PET manufacturing facilities, we (i) confirmed the relevant information regarding the doses shipped to customers that impact revenue recognition, (ii) performed substantive analytical procedures to develop an expectation of the revenue recognized based on the batches of material manufactured and compared our expectation to the amount recorded by management, (iii) performed detail transaction testing for revenue from product sales by making a sample of transactions and agreeing the transaction to the relevant information supporting the ordering and fulfillment of doses and (iv) confirmed selected accounts receivable balances.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. 
Description of Business
Lantheus Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc. (“LMI”) and LMI is the parent company of Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Progenics”). See 
“Progenics Acquisition”
 below and

Note 21, 
“Acquisition of Assets,”
 to these consolidated financial statements respectively, for more information.
The Company develops, manufactures and commercializes innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products that assist clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, heart disease and other diseases. The Company believes its diagnostic products result in improved diagnostic information that enables healthcare providers to better detect and characterize, or rule out, disease, potentially achieving improved patient outcomes, reducing patient risk and limiting overall costs throughout the healthcare system.
The Company’s commercial products are used by cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, nuclear medicine physicians, oncologists, radiologists, sonographers, technologists, and urologists working in a variety of clinical settings. The Company believes that its diagnostic products provide information that enables healthcare providers to better detect and characterize, or rule out, disease, with the potential to achieve better patient outcomes, reduce patient risk, and limit overall costs.
The Company produces and markets its products throughout the United States (the “United States” or the “U.S.”), selling primarily to hospitals, independent diagnostic testing facilities, and radiopharmacies. The Company sells its products outside the U.S. through a combination of direct distribution in Canada and third-party distribution relationships in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia-Pacific, Central America and South America.
Sales of the Company’s prostate cancer diagnostic imaging agent, PYLARIFY (as defined below), are generated in the U.S. through an internal PYLARIFY sales team, as well as a sales team at some of the Company’s positron emission tomography (“PET”) manufacturing facilities (“PMF”) partners. Sales of the Company’s ultrasound enhancing agent, DEFINITY, are generated in the U.S. through an internal DEFINITY sales team. In the U.S., the Company’s other nuclear imaging products, including TechneLite, Xenon-133, NEUROLITE and CARDIOLITE, are primarily sold to commercial radiopharmacies, the majority of which are controlled by or associated with PharmaLogic Holdings Corp, Cardinal Health, RLS, United Pharmacy Partners, and Jubilant Radiopharma. Research revenue is derived from existing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that use our products and product candidates in clinical trials and includes milestone and dose-related payments. A small portion of the Company’s nuclear imaging product sales in the U.S. are generated through the Company’s internal sales force to hospitals and clinics that maintain their own in-house radiopharmaceutical preparation capabilities. 
In Europe, Australia, Asia-Pacific, Central America and South America, the Company generally relies on third-party distributors to market, sell and distribute its nuclear imaging and ultrasound enhancing agent products, either on a country-by-country basis or on a multi-country regional basis. The Company’s executive offices are located in Bedford, Massachusetts, with additional offices in North Billerica, Massachusetts, Montreal, Canada and Lund, Sweden.
Progenics Acquisition
On June 19, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 20, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Holdings, Plato Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (“Merger Sub”), and Progenics, Holdings completed the acquisition of Progenics by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into Progenics, with Progenics surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (the “Progenics Acquisition”).
In connection with the Progenics Acquisition, Lantheus Holdings issued 
26,844,877
 shares of Lantheus Holdings common stock and 
86,630,633
 contingent value rights (each a “CVR”) tied to the financial performance of PYLARIFY to former Progenics stockholders and option holders. Each CVR entitled its holder to receive a pro rata share of aggregate cash payments equal to 
40
% of U.S. net sales generated by PYLARIFY in 2022 and 2023 in excess of $
100.0
 million and $
150.0
 million, respectively. The Company’s aggregate payments in respect of the CVRs, together with any other non-stock consideration treated as paid in connection with the Progenics Acquisition, was capped at 
19.9
% of the total consideration the Company paid in the Progenics Acquisition. Based on the Company’s 2022 PYLARIFY net sales, the Company determined that the aggregate payment obligation under the CVRs was $
99.6
 million, which was the maximum amount payable. The Company paid out this amount in May 2023 in full satisfaction of the CVRs.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, certain judgments regarding revenue recognition, goodwill, tangible and intangible asset valuation, inventory valuation, asset retirement obligations, contingent assets and liabilities, income tax liabilities and related indemnification receivable, deferred tax assets and liabilities and accrued expenses. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates or assumptions.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of promised goods or services to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. See Note 3, “
Revenue from Contracts with Customers,”
 to these consolidated financial statements, for further discussion on revenues.
Accounts Receivable, net
Accounts receivable consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated current expected credit losses. In determining the allowance, consideration includes the probability of recoverability based on past experience as well as current and future economic and market conditions. Certain accounts receivable may be fully reserved when the Company becomes aware of any specific collection issues. The Company periodically reviews the aging of receivables, payment history and customer creditworthiness to determine if adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary. Allowance for doubtful accounts was $
7.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and de minimis at December 31, 2023.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Income tax expense (benefit) represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid, and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that the future tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required involves weighing both positive and negative evidence, including both historical and prospective information, with greater weight given to evidence that is objectively verifiable. A history of recent losses is negative evidence that is difficult to overcome with positive evidence. In evaluating prospective information there are four sources of taxable income: reversals of taxable temporary differences, items that can be carried back to prior tax years (such as net operating losses), pre-tax income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made in the period when those assessments are made.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step recognition threshold and measurement analysis method to determine the financial statement impact of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to other long-term assets and liabilities, or adjustments to deferred taxes, or both. The Company records the related interest and penalties to income tax expense (benefit).
87
Table of Contents
Net Income per Common Share
The Company computes earnings per share using the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, plus the potential dilutive effect of other securities as if those securities were converted or exercised. The Company’s potentially dilutive shares, which could include shares issuable upon conversion of the $
575.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
2.625
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”), are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net income per share when their effect is dilutive. The Company has the option to settle the Notes through cash settlement or a combination of cash and share settlement provided that the principal is settled in cash and the conversion spread is settled in cash or shares as elected by the Company. The Company applies the if-converted method for diluted earnings in order to reflect the conversion spread. During periods in which the Company incurs net losses, both basic and diluted loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding and potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation because their effect would be antidilutive.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include savings deposits, certificates of deposit and money market funds that have original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, represents primarily collateral for a letter of credit securing a lease obligation and a security deposit. The Company believes the carrying value of these assets approximates fair value.
Concentration of Risks and Limited Suppliers
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable. The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable for collectability and provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent that amounts are not expected to be collected. The Company sells primarily to hospitals, independent diagnostic testing facilities, and radiopharmacies.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable, net. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The Company relies on certain materials used in its development and manufacturing processes, some of which are procured from only one or a few sources. The failure of one of these suppliers to deliver on schedule could delay or interrupt the manufacturing or commercialization process and would adversely affect the Company’s operating results. In addition, a disruption in the commercial supply of, or a significant increase in the cost of one of the Company’s materials from these sources could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.
The Company currently relies on Jubilant HollisterStier as its significant manufacturer of DEFINITY and its sole source manufacturer of NEUROLITE, CARDIOLITE and evacuation vials for TechneLite. The Company has Molybdenum-99 supply agreements with Institute for Radioelements of Belgium, running through December 31, 2025, with auto-renewal provisions and terminable upon notice of non-renewal, and with NTP Radioisotopes and its subcontractor Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, running through December 31, 2025.
The following table sets forth revenues for each of the Company’s products representing 10% or more of revenues:

Inventory
Inventory includes material, direct labor and related manufacturing overhead and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company records inventory when the Company takes title to the product. The majority of the value of the inventory relates to non-radioactive products. With respect to the Company’s products that are

radiopharmaceuticals, due to the limited shelf life of such products, they are generally not held as finished goods.
88
Table of Contents
The Company assesses the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory are required. Inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on product shelf life, forecasted demand and other factors.
Inventory costs associated with product that has not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if the Company believes there is probable future commercial use of the product and future economic benefits of the asset. If future commercial use of the product is not probable, then inventory costs associated with such product are expensed as incurred.
 The Company had no inventory pending regulatory approval as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
Property, Plant and Equipment, net
Property, plant & equipment are stated at cost. Replacements of major units of property are capitalized, and replaced properties are retired. Replacements of minor components of property and repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Certain costs to obtain or develop computer software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and recorded in costs of goods sold and operating expenses in the associated functional expense category which utilizes the associated asset. 
The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Class
Range of Estimated Useful Lives
Buildings

50
 years
Land improvements
15
 -

Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant & equipment, the cost and related amount of accumulated depreciation are removed from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds is included in operating income.
Included within machinery and equipment are spare parts. Spare parts include replacement parts relating to plant & equipment and are either recognized as an expense when consumed or reclassified and capitalized as part of the related asset and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.

Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company assesses the fair value of assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed using a variety of methods. Each asset acquired and liability assumed is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates. Acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recognized at fair value and initially characterized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, irrespective of whether the acquired IPR&D has an alternative future use. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
During the measurement period, which extends no later than one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record certain adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the measurement period, all adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as operating expenses or income.

Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely-than-not that it may be impaired. The Company has elected to perform the annual test for goodwill impairment as of October 31st of each year. 
In performing the Company’s annual assessment, the Company is permitted to first perform a qualitative test and if necessary, perform a quantitative test. If the Company is required to perform the quantitative impairment test of goodwill, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using discounted cash flow or other valuation models, such as comparative transactions and market multiples. The Company performed a qualitative assessment and did 
no
t recognize any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Intangible and Long-Lived Assets
The Company tests intangible and long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The Company measures the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If those assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Any impairments are recorded as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets. See Note 7, 
“Property, Plant and Equipment, Net”
 to these consolidated financial statements for further details on impairment. Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets that are held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell.
Intangible assets, consisting of patents, trademarks, customer relationships, a currently marketed product, licenses and developed technology related to the Company’s products are amortized in a method equivalent to the estimated utilization of the economic benefit of the asset.
Costs of IPR&D intangible assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Milestone payments made after regulatory approval are capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over an estimated useful life of the product. Cash payments related to acquired IPR&D intangible assets are reflected as an investing cash flow in the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.
The Company’s IPR&D intangible assets includes intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility, regardless of whether they have alternative future use. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. Because obtaining regulatory approval can include significant risks and uncertainties, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D projects may vary from their fair value at the date of acquisition. The Company classifies IPR&D intangible assets acquired in a business combination as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon completion of the associated research and development efforts, the Company will determine the useful life and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives. Upon permanent abandonment, the Company writes-off the remaining carrying amount of the associated IPR&D intangible asset. IPR&D intangible assets are tested at least annually as of October 31st or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment and any impairment loss is recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. See Note 10, 
“Intangibles, Net and Goodwill”
 to these consolidated financial statements for further details on impairment.
Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, product and environmental liability. The Company records accruals for those loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not recognize gain contingencies until realized.
Convertible Notes
The Company evaluates convertible notes to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for. The change in fair value of any separately recognized derivative is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise or cancellation.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments, including its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the carrying values of these instruments due to their short term nature. The Company’s long-term debt has triggering events that would impact the fair value of the instruments. The Company determined that no triggering event has occurred during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company’s convertible debt was estimated to be approximately $
765.3
 million and $
644.3
 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices of these instruments and was classified as a Level 1 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. For more information on the fair value, see Note 4, 
“Fair Value of Financial Instruments” 
to these consolidated financial statements.
Contingent Consideration Liabilities
The estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are initially measured and recorded on the acquisition date. The contingent consideration liabilities are considered to be Level 3 instruments and are reviewed quarterly, or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate a change in fair value. The contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period with changes in estimated fair values recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
The estimated fair value is determined based on probability adjusted discounted cash flows and Monte Carlo simulation models that include significant estimates and assumptions pertaining to commercialization events and sales targets. The most significant unobservable inputs are the probabilities of achieving regulatory approval of the development projects and subsequent commercial success.
Significant changes in any of the probabilities of success would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Significant changes in the probabilities as to the periods in which milestones will be achieved would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement.
The Company's acquisitions accounted for as asset acquisitions may also include contingent consideration payments to be made for sales-based milestones, development and regulatory milestones. The Company assesses whether such contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative. Contingent consideration payments in an asset acquisition not required to be accounted for as derivatives are recognized when the contingency is resolved, and the consideration is paid or becomes payable. Contingent consideration payments required to be accounted for as derivatives are recorded at fair value on the date of the acquisition and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets.
Derivative Instruments 
The Company has used interest rate swaps to reduce the variability in cash flows associated with a portion of the Company’s forecasted interest payments on its variable rate debt. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Further, the Company must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and, on at least a quarterly basis, continually reevaluate the relationship to ensure it remains highly effective throughout the life of the hedge. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Advertising and Promotion Costs
Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $
29.7
 million, $
26.0
 million and $
26.0
 million, respectively in advertising and promotion costs, which are included in sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of operations.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and relate primarily to the development of new products to add to the Company’s portfolio and costs related to its medical affairs and medical information functions. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
Foreign Currency
The consolidated statements of operations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. The net assets of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars using the end of period exchange rates. The impact from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
91
Table of Contents
Remeasurement of the Company’s foreign currency denominated transactions are included in net income. Transaction gains and losses are reported as a component of other (income) loss, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the stock-based award based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which generally represents the vesting period, and includes an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based award on its measurement date using either the current market price of the stock, the Black-Scholes option valuation model or the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model, whichever is most appropriate. The Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation valuation models incorporate assumptions such as stock price volatility, the expected life of options or awards, a risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. 
Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price. The risk-free interest rates are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the awards’ expected lives. Expected lives are principally based on the Company’s historical exercise experience with previously issued awards. The expected dividend yield is 
zero
 as the Company has never paid dividends and does not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.
Expense for performance restricted stock awards is recognized based upon the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and the number of shares expected to vest based on the terms of the underlying award agreement and the requisite service period(s).

Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders’ equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income. For the Company, other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation gains and losses, as well as realized gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to the Company’s interest rate swaps. The accumulated other comprehensive loss balance consists entirely of foreign currency translation gains and losses and realized and unrealized gains and losses on outstanding cash flow hedges related to the Company’s interest rate swaps.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company’s compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may require it to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances in jurisdictions where it does business or maintains properties. The Company establishes accruals when those costs are legally obligated and can be reasonably estimated. Accrual amounts are estimated, which may include the assistance of third-party environmental specialists, and are based on currently available information, regulatory requirements, remediation strategies, historical experience, the relative shares of the total remediation costs, a relevant discount rate, and the time periods of when estimated costs can be reasonably predicted. Changes in these assumptions could impact the Company’s future reported results.
92
Table of Contents
The Company has production facilities which manufacture and process radioactive materials at its sites in North Billerica, Massachusetts and, through March 1, 2024, Somerset, New Jersey. The Company considers its legal obligation to remediate its facilities upon a decommissioning of its radioactive-related operations as an asset retirement obligation. The fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations is recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. The liability is measured at the present value of the obligation expected to be incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying values of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the assets’ useful lives. 
The Company has identified conditional asset retirement obligations related to the future removal and disposal of asbestos contained in certain of the buildings located on the Company’s North Billerica campus. The Company believes the asbestos is appropriately contained and it is compliant with all applicable environmental regulations. If these properties undergo major renovations or are demolished, certain environmental regulations are in place, which specify the manner in which asbestos must be handled and disposed. The Company is required to record the fair value of these conditional liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, sufficient information was not available to estimate a liability for such conditional asset retirement obligations as the obligations to remove the asbestos from these properties have indeterminable settlement dates. As such, no liability for conditional asset retirement obligations has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Self-Insurance Reserves
The Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 include $
2.8
 million and $
1.0
 million of accrued liabilities associated with employee medical costs that are retained by the Company, respectively. The Company estimates the required liability of those claims on an undiscounted basis based upon various assumptions which include, but are not limited to, the Company’s historical loss experience and projected loss development factors. The required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience, including changes in the number of incidents (frequency) and change in the ultimate cost per incident (severity).
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Period
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

The Company classifies its revenues into 
three
 product categories: Radiopharmaceutical Oncology, Precision Diagnostics, and Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue. Radiopharmaceutical Oncology includes PYLARIFY and AZEDRA. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company discontinued the production of AZEDRA. Precision Diagnostics includes DEFINITY, TechneLite and other diagnostic imaging products. Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue includes out-licensing arrangements and partnerships for the Company’s biomarker solutions, digital solutions, and radiotherapeutic platforms, inclusive of two investigational late-stage diagnostic agents, MK-6240 and NAV-4694. On August 2, 2023, the Company sold the RELISTOR net sales royalty asset (the “RELISTOR royalty asset”) under its license agreement with Bausch Health Companies, Inc. (“Bausch”); the Company retained the rights to future sales-based milestone payments. 
No
 sales-based milestone payment was earned in 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company earned a sales-based milestone payment of $
15.0
 million.
On January 31, 2022, the Company entered into a global settlement agreement with Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”), Advanced Accelerator Applications USA, Inc., Endocyte, Inc. and their affiliates (the “Novartis Agreement”) to settle certain disputes between the parties. Under the Novartis Agreement, Novartis agreed to make a lump sum payment to the Company, as well as to reimburse the Company for certain fees and expenses in connection with certain German litigation, and the Company agreed to license certain intellectual property to Novartis. In addition, the Company agreed to supply PYLARIFY for clinical purposes at an arms-length value which will be recorded revenue in the future as product is provided. In accordance with the Company's ASC 606,
 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
, assessment, Novartis is considered to be a customer. The Company determined that the $
24.0
 million constituted a single element which was satisfied on the date of the execution of the Novartis Agreement. The Company determined that the license of intellectual property carried a fair value of $
24.0
 million. As such, the Company assigned the value to the fair value of the license, which constitutes the entire transaction price and does not require further allocation. The Company determined that the $
24.0
 million represented the point at which the licensee was able to use and benefit from the license and recognized revenue when the license was granted to Novartis upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. The Company recognized the $
24.0
 million fee as revenue on its consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The Company received the $
24.0
 million payment in April 2022.

Product Revenue, Net
The Company sells its products principally to hospitals, independent diagnostic testing facilities, and radiopharmacies. The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales or group purchasing organization agreements, to be the contracts with a customer.
For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled.
The Company typically invoices customers upon satisfaction of identified performance obligations. As the Company’s 
standard payment terms are 30 to 60 days
 from invoicing, the Company has elected to use the significant financing component practical expedient.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on their relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances.
Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer. Further, in determining whether control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and legal title, along with risks and rewards of ownership having transferred to the customer.
Frequently, the Company receives orders for products to be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across several reporting periods. The Company invoices for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues for each distinct product delivered, assuming transfer of control has occurred.
The Company generally does not separately charge customers for shipping and handling costs, but any shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenue, net. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.
Variable Consideration
Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established for discounts, returns, rebates and allowances that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as a current liability. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as the Company’s historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the 
96
Table of Contents
Company’s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company’s estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.
Rebates and Allowances:
 The Company provides certain customers with rebates and allowances that are explicitly stated in the Company’s contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company establishes a liability for such amounts, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These rebates and allowances result from performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and administrative fees the Company is required to pay to group purchasing organizations. The Company estimates the amount of rebates and allowances that are explicitly stated in the Company’s contracts based on a combination of actual purchases and an estimate of the customer’s buying patterns.
Product Returns:
 The Company generally offers customers a limited right of return due to non-conforming product. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by its customers and records this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company currently estimates product return liabilities using its historical product return information and considers other factors that it believes could significantly impact its expected returns, including product recalls. Reserves for product returns are not significant to the Company due to the nature of its products including radiopharmaceutical products with limited half-lives.

License and Royalty Revenues
The Company has entered into licensing agreements, under which it licenses certain rights to third parties. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to the Company of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. The Company also has distribution licenses which are treated as combined performance obligations with the delivery of its products and are classified as product revenue, net.
In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, the Company performs the five-step approach stated earlier. The Company uses judgment in determining the number of performance obligations in a license agreement by assessing whether the license is distinct or should be combined with another performance obligation, as well as the nature of the license. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. The Company uses key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include market conditions, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, development timelines and probabilities of regulatory success.
Licenses of intellectual property:
 If the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
Milestone Payments:
 At the inception of each arrangement that includes development or sales milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in 
97
Table of Contents
the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are outside the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect license and royalty revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. At December 31, 2024, the variable consideration for the milestone payments is constrained and is excluded from contract price until the milestone is achieved by the customer.
Royalty Revenues:
 For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).
Contract Costs
The Company recognizes an asset for incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects to recover those costs. The Company’s sales incentive compensation plans qualify for capitalization since these plans are directly related to sales achieved during a period of time. However, the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense the costs as they are incurred, within sales and marketing expenses, since the amortization period is less than one year.
The Company recognized certain revenues as follows:

The Company did not record any revenue related to performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The Company’s performance obligations are typically part of contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. As such, the Company is not disclosing the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) as of the end of the reporting period.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability of fair value measurements, financial instruments are categorized based on a hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below:
•
Level 1
 — Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 
— Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.) and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).
•
Level 3
 — Unobservable inputs that reflect a Company’s estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available, including its own data.
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of money market funds, interest rate swaps, contingent consideration liabilities and equity investments. The Company invests excess cash from its operating cash accounts in overnight investments and reflects these amounts in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined based on observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and reflects the contractual terms of these instruments, including the period to maturity. Please refer to Note 13, 
“Derivative Instruments,”
 to these consolidated financial statements for further details on the interest rate swaps. Investment in equity securities resulting from the Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. (“Perspective”) and Radiopharm Theranostics Limited (“Radiopharm”) strategic agreements were recorded at fair value by the Company and are adjusted for price changes observable in the market each quarter. The Company recorded the contingent consideration liabilities resulting from the Progenics Acquisition at fair value based on inputs that are not observable in the market.

Perspective Therapeutics, Inc. Equity Securities
99
Table of Contents
At December 31, 2024, the Company held 
11,677,339
 shares of Perspective common stock (“Perspective Shares”). The Company accounts for its investment in Perspective Shares as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value, as the securities are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). The fair value of the equity securities is based on the closing price of the Perspective Shares on the NYSE at the end of the fiscal period and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the equity securities are valued using quoted market prices. The fair value of the Perspective Shares as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $
37.3
 million based on a closing market price of $
3.19
 per share on December 31, 2024, resulting in an unrealized loss of $
41.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 21, 
“Acquisition of Assets”
 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Perspective transaction.

Radiopharm Theranostics Limited Equity Securities
At December 31, 2024, the Company held 
149,625,180
 shares of Radiopharm common stock (“Radiopharm Shares”). The Company accounts for its investment in Radiopharm Shares as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value, as the securities are publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”). The fair value of the equity securities is based on the closing price of the Radiopharm Shares on the ASX at the end of the fiscal period and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the equity securities are valued using quoted market prices. The fair value of the Radiopharm Shares as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $
2.2
 million based on the converted closing market price of approximately $
0.01
 per share on December 31, 2024, resulting in an unrealized loss on equity securities of $
2.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 21, 
“Acquisition of Assets” 
to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Radiopharm transaction.
Contingent Consideration
The Company assumed contingent consideration liabilities related to a previous acquisition completed by Progenics in 2013 (“2013 Acquisition”). These contingent consideration liabilities include potential payments of up to $
70.0
 million if the Company attains certain net sales targets primarily for AZEDRA and 1095 (also known as 131 I-MIP-1095) and a $
5.0
 million 1095 commercialization milestone. Additionally, there is a potential payment of up to $
10.0
 million for a commercialization milestone related to a prostate cancer product candidate the Company refers to as “1404” that was out-licensed to ROTOP Pharmaka GmbH. The Company’s total potential payments related to the 2013 Acquisition are approximately $
85.0
 million. The Company considers the contingent consideration liabilities relating to the 2013 Acquisition each a Level 3 instrument (one with significant unobservable inputs) in the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value of these was determined based on probability adjusted discounted cash flows and Monte Carlo simulation models that included significant estimates and assumptions pertaining to commercialization events and sales targets. The most significant unobservable inputs with respect to 1095 and 1404 are the probabilities of achieving regulatory approval of those development projects and subsequent commercial success.
Significant changes in any of the probabilities of success, the probabilities as to the periods in which sales targets and milestones will be achieved, discount rates or underlying revenue forecasts would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The Company records the contingent consideration liability at fair value with changes in estimated fair values recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company can give no assurance that the actual amounts paid, if any, in connection with the contingent consideration liabilities will be consistent with any recurring fair value estimate of such contingent consideration liabilities.
The following tables summarize quantitative information and assumptions pertaining to the fair value measurement of liabilities using Level 3 inputs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2024. In August 2024, the Company entered into a bill of sale with the holder of a significant portion of the contingent milestone rights related to the 2013 Acquisition (the “2013 Milestone Rights”) to transfer the holder’s portion of the 2013 Milestone Rights back to the Company for $
1,000
. This buyout resulted in a $
1.5
 million
 decrease in general and administrative expense during 2024 due to the reduction in outstanding 2013 Milestone Rights.

The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not realizable, the Company evaluated all available positive and negative evidence. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $
15.6
 million and $
3.6
 million, respectively. The amount in 2024 primarily related to unrealized losses incurred during the year on its investment in equity securities and to net deferred tax assets of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The 2023 amount only relates to the net deferred tax assets of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. 
Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that could occur in the future in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“IRC Section 382”) and with Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and taxes, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by IRC Section 382, results from transactions which impact the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
269.9
 million, $
128.1
 million of which will expire between 2027 and 2037, and $
141.8
 million of which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has foreign net operating losses of $
29.0
 million and $
4.3
 million which expire in 2035 and $
24.7
 million of which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company’s state net operating losses are $
9.1
 million on a tax-effected basis, which will expire between 2025 and 2044. The Company has state research credit carryforwards of $
2.1
 million, which will expire between 2026 and 2039.
The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination for three years after the filing date of the return. The state and foreign income tax returns are subject to examination for periods varying from three to four years after filing, depending on the specific jurisdiction’s statutes of limitation, and in the case of Sweden, up to six years after the end of the financial year.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of the medical imaging business from Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) in 2008, the Company recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions related to the acquired business and simultaneously entered into an indemnification agreement with BMS for any payments made to settle those uncertain tax positions with the taxing authorities. 
In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, the change in the tax liability, penalties and interest associated with these obligations (net of any offsetting federal or state benefit) is recognized within income tax expense. As these reserves change, adjustments are included in income tax expense while the offsetting adjustment is included in other income. Assuming that the receivable from BMS continues to be considered recoverable by the Company, there will be no effect on net income and no net cash outflows related to these liabilities. Included in other (income) loss for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, is tax indemnification (income) expense, net of ($
0.1
) million, $
4.9
 million and $
9.6
 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were $
9.4
 million and $
5.4
 million, respectively, consisting of uncertain tax positions of $
7.6
 million and $
4.1
 million, respectively, interest accruals of $
1.8
 million and $
1.3
 million, respectively, and 
no
 penalty accruals as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The increase in uncertain tax positions during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily related to state tax uncertainties. As of December 31, 2024, $
1.4
 million, $
7.3
 million, and $
0.7
 million of these liabilities were recorded in current liabilities, other long-term liabilities, and as a reduction of deferred tax assets, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, $
1.3
 million, $
3.2
 million and $
0.9
 million of these liabilities were recorded in current liabilities, other long-term liabilities, and as a reduction of deferred tax assets, respectively. Included in the 2024 tax provision are expenses of $
2.5
 million, primarily related to state tax position. Included in the 2023 and 2022 tax provision are benefits of $
5.0
 million and $
12.6
 million, respectively, relating to reversals of uncertain tax positions recognized upon settlements, effective settlements, or lapses of relevant statutes of limitation, partially offset by interest accruals. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has $
5.7
 million of unrecognized tax benefits which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. 
During 2023, as a result of a decline in expected future cash flows related to the AZEDRA marketed intangible asset, the Company determined certain impairment triggers had occurred. Subsequently, in 2023, the Company discontinued the production and promotion of AZEDRA and decided to wind down its facility at 110 Clyde Rd, Somerset, New Jersey (the “Somerset Facility”). The Company reviewed revised undiscounted cash flows that were estimated to be generated by the asset group as of June 30, 2023. Based on the undiscounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the asset group had net carrying values that exceeded their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The Company then estimated the fair value of the asset group based on their discounted cash flows. The carrying value exceeded the fair value and as a result, the Company recorded a noncash impairment of $
6.0
 million during 2023 in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of operations.
On January 8, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Perspective to transfer the sublease for the Somerset Facility and sold the associated assets at the Somerset Facility for $
8.0
 million. The transfer of the sublease and completion of the asset sale occurred on March 1, 2024. The sale of assets resulted in a derecognition to the right-of-use asset of $
0.4
 million, the lease liability of $
0.4
 million and remaining property, plant and equipment of $
0.8
 million. The Company also incurred commission expense of $
1.0

6.3

classified as held for sale and comprised entirely of property, plant and equipment, net. The Company determined that the fair value of the net assets being sold exceeded the carrying value as of September 30, 2023. The purchase price for the sold portion of the North Billerica campus was $
9.8
 million in cash. As a result of the sale on December 10, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on sale of assets of $
2.1
 million in their consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company considers its legal obligation to remediate its facilities upon a decommissioning of its radioactive-related operations as an asset retirement obligation. The Company has production facilities which manufacture and process radioactive materials at its sites in North Billerica, Massachusetts and, through March 1, 2024, Somerset, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2024, the asset retirement liability is measured at the present value of the asset retirement liability expected to be incurred, and is approximately $
25.1
 million.

In March 2023, the Company stopped all development activities in relation to a future indication associated with AZEDRA, which was classified as an IPR&D intangible asset. The asset group, which consisted of the IPR&D asset and a currently marketed product (the “AZEDRA intangible asset group”), was assessed for impairment. The Company considered several factors in estimating the future projections of revenues and cash flows of the AZEDRA intangible asset group as part of the impairment testing. The Company concluded that the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of the AZEDRA intangible asset group, which had no value. The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $
15.6
 million in 
research and development expenses
 relating to the IPR&D asset and $
116.4
 million in 
cost of goods sold
 relating to the currently marketed indication of AZEDRA in the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
On August 2, 2023, the Company sold the right to its RELISTOR royalty asset under its license agreement with Bausch; the Company retained the rights to future sales-based milestone payments. The Company received an initial payment of approximately $
98.0
 million in connection with the sale and has the right to receive an additional payment from the buyer of $
5.0
 million if worldwide net sales of RELISTOR in 2025 exceed a specified threshold. The additional payment would be recognized upon achievement of the specified threshold. Decreases of $
63.6
 million of license assets and $
17.5
 million of associated accumulated amortization, as well as a gain of $
51.8
 million were recorded as a result of the sale. 
No
 sales-based milestone payment was earned in 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company earned a sales-based milestone payment of $
15.0
 million.
On August 15, 2023, the Company announced that it would discontinue the production and promotion of AZEDRA and would be winding down its Somerset Facility. The Company continued manufacturing AZEDRA until the first quarter of 2024 to provide doses of AZEDRA to then-current patients so they could complete their treatment regimen. No AZEDRA was manufactured after March 1, 2024, when the Company transferred the tangible assets and associated lease of its Somerset Facility to Perspective. See Note 7, 
“Property, Plant and Equipment, Net” 
to these consolidated financial statements for impairment analysis.
In February 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with the stockholders of Cerveau Technologies, Inc. (“Cerveau”) to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Cerveau for approximately $
35.3
 million. In May 2023, upon successful completion of a technology transfer, the Company paid $
10.0
 million to the selling stockholders of Cerveau. This additional contingent payment was capitalized as part of the asset cost and increased the Company’s customer relationship intangible assets. See Note 21, 
“Acquisition of Assets”
 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Company’s acquisition of Cerveau.
In June 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with the stockholders of Meilleur (“Meilleur Stockholders”) to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of Meilleur (which holds the rights under a license agreement to develop and commercialize NAV-4694) for approximately $
32.9
 million. The Company recorded a developed technology intangible asset of $
40.3
 million as a result of the purchase price and the specific assets and liabilities of Meilleur that were acquired as part of the asset acquisition based on their value at the agreed upon closing date. In August 2024, upon successful completion of a technology transfer, the Company paid $
10.0
 million to the Meilleur Stockholders. This additional contingent payment was capitalized as part of the asset cost and increased the total value of the Company’s developed technology intangible assets. See Note 21, 
“Acquisition of Assets”
 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Meilleur.

2022 Revolving Facility
In December 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its $
350.0
 million 
five-year
 revolving credit facility, which, among other things, increased the facility from $
350.0
 million to $
750.0
 million (as amended, the “2022 Revolving Facility”) and extended the maturity date from December 2, 2027 to December 19, 2029. Under the terms of the 2022 Revolving Facility, the lenders are committed to extending credit to the Company from time to time consisting of revolving loans (the “Revolving Loans”) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $
750.0
 million (the “Revolving Commitment”) at any time, including a $
40.0
 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit (the “Letters of Credit”) and a $
20.0
 million sub-facility for swingline loans (the “Swingline Loans”). The Revolving Loans, Letters of Credit, and the Swingline Loans, if used, are expected to be used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes.
The Revolving Loans bear interest, with pricing based from time to time at the Company’s election, at (i) the secured overnight financing rate as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on its website plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
1.25
% to 
2.00
% based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio or (ii) the alternative base rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
0.25
% to 
1.00
%, in either case, based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. The 2022 Revolving Facility also includes an unused commitment fee at a rate ranging from 
0.15
% to 
0.30
% per annum based on the Company’s total net leverage ratio. Interest associated with the unused commitment is recorded to accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and paid out on a quarterly basis. 
The Company is permitted to voluntarily prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part, or reduce or terminate the Revolving Commitment, in each case, without premium or penalty. On any business day on which the total amount of outstanding Revolving Loans, Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans exceeds the total Revolving Commitment, the Company must prepay the Revolving Loans in an amount equal to such excess. The Company is not required to make mandatory prepayments under the 2022 Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Facility.
108
Table of Contents
The Company has the right to request an increase to the Revolving Commitment in an aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of the sum of $
685.0
 million (so that the total amount available is $
1.44
 billion) or 100% of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended, plus additional amounts in certain circumstances (collectively, the “Incremental Cap”), minus certain incremental term loans made pursuant to specified incremental term loan commitments (“Incremental Term Loans”). The Company has the right to request Incremental Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to the Incremental Cap less any incremental increases to the Revolving Commitment. Proceeds of Incremental Term Loans may be used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes and will bear interest at rates agreed between the Company and the lenders providing the Incremental Term Loans. 
2022 Revolving Facility Covenants
The 2022 Revolving Facility contains a number of affirmative, negative and reporting covenants, as well as financial maintenance covenants pursuant to which the Company is required to be in quarterly compliance, measured on a trailing four quarter basis, with 
two
 financial covenants. The minimum interest coverage ratio must be at least 
3.00
 to 1.00. The maximum total net leverage ratio permitted by the financial covenant is 
3.50
 to 1.00, other than in connection with certain acquisitions, in which case, the maximum total net leverage ratio permitted can be increased to 
4.00
 to 1.00.
The 2022 Revolving Facility contains usual and customary restrictions on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness (ii) create liens; (iii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; (iv) sell certain assets; (v) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments; (vi) make certain investments; (vii) repay subordinated indebtedness prior to stated maturity; and (viii) enter into certain transactions with its affiliates.
Upon an event of default, the Administrative Agent will have the right to declare the loans and other obligations outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Facility immediately due and payable and all commitments immediately terminated.
The 2022 Revolving Facility is guaranteed by Lantheus Holdings, and certain subsidiaries of LMI, including Progenics and Lantheus Real Estate, and obligations under the 2022 Revolving Facility are generally secured by first priority liens over substantially all of the assets of each of LMI, Lantheus Holdings, and certain subsidiaries of LMI, including Progenics and Lantheus MI Real Estate (subject to customary exclusions set forth in the transaction documents) owned as of December 2, 2022 or thereafter acquired.
2.625
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027
On December 8, 2022, the Company issued $
575.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
2.625
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”), which includes $
75.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes sold pursuant to the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional Notes. The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of December 8, 2022 (the “Indenture”), among the Company, LMI (the “Guarantor”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as Guarantor, and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $
557.8
 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantor. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 
2.625
% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2023, and will mature on December 15, 2027 unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 12.5291 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
79.81
 per share of the Company’s common stock, representing an initial conversion premium of approximately 
42.5
% above the closing price of $
56.01
 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 5, 2022). In no event shall the conversation rate per $1,000 in principal amount of notes exceed 17.8539 shares of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2027, the Notes may be converted at the option of the holders only upon occurrence of specified events and during certain periods, and thereafter until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Notes may be converted at any time. The Company will satisfy any conversion by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at its option, on or after December 22, 2025 if the closing sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price of the Notes for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The Company evaluated the Notes upon completion of the sale and concluded on the following features:
109
Table of Contents
•
Conversion Feature:
 The Company determined that the conversion feature qualifies for the classification of equity. As a result, the conversion feature should not be bifurcated as a derivative instrument and the Notes were accounted for as a single liability. 
•
Redemption Features:
 The redemption features were reviewed within the Notes and the Company determined that the redemption features are closely related to the Notes and as such should not be separately accounted for as a bifurcated derivative instrument. 
•
Additional Interest Features: 
The Notes may result in additional interest if the Company fails to timely file any document or report that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company will pay additional interest on the notes at a rate equal to 
0.25
% to 
0.50
% per annum based on the principal amount of notes outstanding for each day the Company failure to file has occurred or the notes are not otherwise freely tradable. Further, if the notes are assigned a restricted CUSIP number or the notes are not otherwise freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by holders other than our affiliates or holders that were our affiliates at any time during the three months immediately preceding as of the 385
th
 day after the last date of original issuance of the notes offered hereby, the Company will pay additional interest on the notes at a rate equal to (i) 
0.25
% to 
0.50
% per annum based on the principal amount of notes outstanding for each day until the restrictive legend has been removed from the notes, the notes are assigned an unrestricted CUSIP and the notes are freely tradable. The Company concluded that the interest feature is unrelated to the credit risk and should be bifurcated from the Notes, however, the Company assessed the probabilities of triggering events occurring under these features and does not expect to trigger the aforementioned events. These events will continue to be monitored to determine whether the interest feature will be bifurcated if it has value.
Holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change prior to the maturity at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In connection with certain triggering events, the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders of the Notes who elect to convert their Notes in connection with such corporate events.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the closing price of the Company’s common stock did not exceed 
130
% of the conversion price of the Notes for more than 
20
 trading days of the last 
30
 consecutive trading days of the quarter. As a result, the Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders of the Notes during the first quarter of 2024, the quarter immediately following the quarter when the conditions are met, as stated in the terms of the Notes. Because the Notes are not considered convertible under the terms of the Notes and pursuant to ASC 470-10, the Company classified the carrying value of the Notes as long-term debt, net and other borrowings on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. 
The Company recorded interest expense of approximately $
15.1
 million related to the Notes for the year ended December 31, 2024.
13. 
Derivative Instruments
The Company has used, but does not currently use, interest rate swaps to reduce the variability in cash flows associated with a portion of the Company’s forecasted interest payments on its variable rate debt.

Stock-Based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plans
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s approved equity incentive plans included the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (“2013 Plan”), and the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (“2008 Plan”). These plans are administered by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and permit the granting of stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and dividend equivalent rights to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company.
The Company has certain stock option and restricted stock awards outstanding under each of its equity incentive plans but, upon adoption of the 2015 Plan, the Company no longer grants new equity awards under its 2008 and 2013 Plans. The Company adopted its 2015 Plan in June 2015 and subsequently amended the plan in April 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2024 and again in October 2024. The amended plans increased the common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan to an aggregate 
14,930,277
 shares. The Company assumed Progenics equity plans due to the acquisition as discussed in Note 1, 
“Description of Business”
 to these consolidated financial statements. The Company no longer grants new equity awards under the Progenics equity plans.

Total Stockholder Return Restricted Stock Awards
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted total stockholder return (“TSR”) awards that include a 
three-year
 market condition where the performance measurement period is 
three years
. Vesting of the TSR awards is based on the Company’s level of attainment of specified TSR targets relative to the percentage appreciation of a specified index of companies for the respective 
three-year
 period and is also subject to the continued employment of the grantees. The number of shares that are earned over the performance period ranges from 
0
% to 
200
% of the initial award. 
The fair value of these awards are based on a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model with the following assumptions:

Modification of equity awards
In the fourth quarter of 2024, as part of the Company’s evolution into a fully integrated radiopharmaceutical company, the Company reviewed its current capabilities and skillsets and began implementing organizational changes deemed necessary to best position the Company to execute on its long-term strategy. These changes include transitioning approximately 
60
 employees out of the Company. In connection with these changes, the Company approved equity modifications that allowed grants of stock options and RSUs issued to those impacted by this event to continue to vest in 2024 and 2025 with any unvested stock option and RSU grants as of December 31, 2025 to be cancelled. TSR awards granted to these individuals will continue to vest on their original vesting schedule but any shares issued will be issued in a pro-rated amount based on the time served during the performance period. The incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from these modifications recognized in 2024 was $
2.7
 million. Total 
costs related to these organizational changes
 through December 31, 2024 were approximately $
9.4
 million. Remaining costs expected to be incurred are not material.
Common Stock Repurchases
In November 2024, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $
250
 million of the Company’s common stock over the next twelve months (the “2024 Program”). Such repurchases may be made from time to time via open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trades intending to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The actual timing, number and dollar amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by our management, in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the market price of the Company’s common stock. In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 
1.1
 million shares of its outstanding common stock under the 2024 Program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $
100.0
 million at an average stock price of $
89.59
 per share.
16. 
Leases 
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has operating and finance leases for vehicles, corporate offices and certain equipment. 
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Company assumed 
two
 operating leases as a result of the Progenics acquisition related to office space at the World Trade Center in New York City, pursuant to a lease agreement expiring in September 2030 (the “WTC Lease”), and a radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Somerset, New Jersey, under a sublease agreement expiring in November 2028, which were recorded as of June 19, 2020, for $
18.6
 million and $
0.6
 million, respectively. The Company entered into an operating lease related to office space in Somerset, New Jersey, under a lease agreement expiring in August 2026, which was recorded in October 2021 for $
0.7
 million. The Company entered into an operating lease agreement in February 2022 to lease office space in Bedford, Massachusetts (“Existing Premises”), under a lease agreement expiring in June 2031, which commenced and was recorded in December 2022 for $
11.0
 million (the “Existing Premises Lease”).
On May 4, 2023, the Company entered into a modification to the Existing Premises Lease. The lease modification includes a lease of additional office and laboratory space at the Bedford location (the “Additional Premises”) for a term of 15 years and 4 months and extends the term of the lease for the Existing Premises to be coterminous with the term of the lease for the Additional Premises. As a result of the extended term for the Existing Premises, the Company recorded an additional right-of-use asset and liability of $
6.0
 million in May 2023. The modification also contains a provision to convert the rent schedule of the Existing Premises from gross to triple net in 2025, which may result in an additional adjustment to the right-of-use asset and liability. In September 2023, the landlord provided notice to the Company that its renovations of the Additional Premises were completed. As a result of the notice, the Company recorded an additional right-of-use asset and liability of $
23.5
 million as of September 1, 2023. To determine the value of the additional right-of-use asset and liability, the Company was required to calculate the discount rate of the lease modification. The discount rate was determined based on the expected lease term and by comparing interest rates in the market for similar borrowings 
113
Table of Contents
with comparable credit quality of the Company. The lease for the Additional Premises allows for the extension of 
five years
 to begin immediately upon the expiration of the original term. On October 7, 2024, the Company executed a second amendment to the Bedford Lease for additional space resulting in one additional operating lease. As of December 31, 2024, the additional operating lease has not yet commenced. The future lease payments for this lease are approximately $
17.0
 million. The lease is expected to commence in 2026 and has a noncancellable lease term of 
13.3
 years.
On March 1, 2024, the Company transferred the sublease and completed the asset sale of the Somerset Facility. See Note 7, 
“Property, Plan and Equipment, Net”
 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the sublease transfer. 
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as the Company has elected to apply the short-term lease exemption. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Impact of the Convertible Notes
The Company considered whether the notes are participating securities through the two-class method. Per the terms of the indenture governing the Notes’, the Company determined that if a cash dividend is paid that is greater than the then stock price, the holder of Notes will receive cash on an if-converted basis. While this feature is considered to be a participating right; basic earnings per share is only impacted if the Company’s earning exceeds the current share price, regardless of whether such dividend is declared. During the year ended December 31, 2024, no such dividend was declared. In addition, the Company is required to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash upon conversion, and therefore, the Company uses the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion option on diluted net income per share, if applicable, unless the application of the two-class method is dilutive. The conversion option will have a dilutive impact on net income per share of Common Stock when the average price per share of the Company’s Common Stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of the Notes of $
79.81
 per share. See Note 12, 
“Long-Term Debt, Net, and Other Borrowings,” 
to these consolidated financial statement
s 
for further discussion on the Notes.

The Company has entered into agreements which contain certain percentage volume purchase requirements. The Company has excluded these future purchase commitments from the table above since there are no minimum purchase commitments or payments under these agreements.
License Agreements
The Company has entered into license agreements in which fixed payments have been committed to be paid on an annual basis.
116
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024, no future fixed payments are required under license agreements. The Company may be required to pay approximately $
3.7
 billion in contingent payments under the Company’s license agreements. These contingent payments include potential milestone or contractual payment obligations contingent upon the achievement or occurrence of future milestones or events and the amounts and timing of such potential obligations are unknown or uncertain.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company is a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company has in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities, which expose it to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory or other proceedings, as a result of which the Company could be required to pay significant fines or penalties. The costs and outcome of litigation, regulatory or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims, actions or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which, if imposed against the Company, could materially and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. If a matter is both probable to result in material liability and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible material loss or range of loss. If such loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its consolidated financial statements.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any material ongoing litigation to which the Company was a party. On January 26, 2024, the Company was sued in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by Advanced Accelerator Applications USA, Inc. and Advanced Accelerator Applications SA, each a Novartis entity, for patent infringement in response to the filing of our Abbreviated New Drug Application and Paragraph IV certification in connection with PNT2003, consistent with the process established by the Hatch-Waxman Act. Because the outcome of litigation is uncertain, the Company cannot predict how or when this matter will ultimately be resolved.
On February 23, 2024, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against a healthcare-related imaging software developer, and that developer filed a motion to dismiss the case based on grounds of invalidity for certain patents and failure to state a claim for infringement for other patents. The court dismissed the developer’s motion to dismiss as to invalidity, and granted the motion as to certain allegations of infringement. Because the outcome of litigation is uncertain, the Company cannot predict how or when this matter will ultimately be resolved.
20. 
401(k) Plan
The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for its U.S. employees. The 401(k) Plan covers U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, the employees may elect to make tax-deferred contributions through payroll deductions within statutory and plan limits, and the Company may elect to make non-elective discretionary contributions. The Company may also make optional contributions to the 401(k) Plan for any plan year at its discretion.
Expense recognized by the Company for matching contributions made to the 401(k) Plan was $
5.8
 million, $
4.1
 million, and $
3.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Acquisition of Assets
In December 2022, the Company made upfront payments of $
260.0
 million to POINT Biopharma Global Inc. (“POINT”) as a part of an asset acquisition with the potential for additional milestone payments of approximately $
1.8
 billion between the two licensed assets based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval and net sales and commercial milestones. 
Under the terms of the PNT2002 License Agreement, the Company paid POINT an upfront cash payment of $
250.0
 million, and could pay up to an additional $
281.0
 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory milestones related to PNT2002. POINT is also eligible to receive up to $
1.3
 billion in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual sales thresholds of PNT2002.
Under the terms of the PNT2003 License Agreement, the Company paid POINT an upfront cash payment of $
10.0
 million, and could pay up to an additional $
34.5
 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory milestones related to PNT2003. POINT is also eligible to receive up to $
275.0
 million in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual sales thresholds of PNT2003.
Additionally, the Company will pay POINT royalties on net sales, beyond certain financial thresholds and subject to conditions, of 
20
% for PNT2002 and 
15
% for PNT2003. Costs of IPR&D projects acquired as part of an asset acquisition that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred, and therefore, a charge of $
260.0
 million was recognized in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022.
On February 6, 2023, the Company acquired Cerveau. Cerveau holds the rights under a license agreement to develop and commercialize MK-6240, an investigational late-stage F-18-labeled PET imaging agent that targets tau tangles in Alzheimer’s disease. The Company determined that upon review of its acquisition of Cerveau, the transaction did not meet the definition of a business combination and is therefore treated as an asset acquisition. 
In February 2023, the Company made an upfront payment of approximately $
35.3
 million to the stockholders of Cerveau (the “Cerveau Stockholders”) and paid the Cerveau Stockholders an additional $
10.0
 million in May 2023 upon the successful completion of a technology transfer. The Company could pay up to an additional $
51.0
 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. regulatory milestones related to MK-6240. The Cerveau Stockholders are also eligible to receive up to $
1.2
 billion in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual commercial sales thresholds of MK-6240, as well as up to $
13.5
 million in research revenue milestones upon achievement of specified annual research revenue thresholds. Additionally, the Company will pay to the Cerveau Stockholders up to double-digit royalty payments for research revenue and commercial sales. Research revenue is derived from existing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that use MK-6240 in clinical trials. The purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company purchased Cerveau specified, among other things, that certain Cerveau Stockholders provide transition and clinical development services for a prescribed time following the closing of the transaction.
On January 8, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Perspective to participate in the next qualified financing to purchase the shares of Perspective common stock (“Perspective Shares”). On January 22, 2024, the Company purchased 
56,342,355
 Perspective Shares, representing 
11.39
% of the outstanding Perspective Shares, at the fair market offering price of $
0.37
 per share. Included within the agreement is a covenant which allows for the Company to designate one observer to Perspective’s board of directors. The observer has the option to attend any or all board meetings in a nonvoting capacity and the right to receive any board materials, except under certain instances where attorney-client privilege is necessary, where the material relates to a business or contractual relationship with the Company, to avoid bona fide conflict of interest, exposure of trade secrets or relating to a change of control transaction. The Company also purchased 
60,431,039
 Perspective Shares at a fair market purchase price of $
0.95
 per share as an investor in a private placement transaction on March 6, 2024, which resulted in the Company holding a cumulative 
19.90
% of the outstanding Perspective Shares (or 
17.35
% on a fully diluted basis) after giving effect to the closing of the private placement transaction. The Company holds less than 20% of the outstanding Perspective Shares and therefore does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of Perspective because the Company’s board observer has no voting rights and there is otherwise no participation in policy-making processes, no interchange of managerial personnel, and no sharing of technology between the Company and Perspective.
Also effective January 8, 2024, the Company obtained the following options and rights from Perspective for an aggregate upfront payment of $
28.0
 million in cash:
•
An exclusive option from Perspective to negotiate for an exclusive license under the rights of Perspective and its affiliates to Perspective’s Pb212-VMT-⍺-NET, a clinical stage alpha therapy developed for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit the VMT-α-NET Product.
•
A right to co-fund the investigational new drug application (“IND”) enabling studies for early-stage therapeutic candidates targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen and gastrin releasing peptide receptor and, prior to IND filing, a right to negotiate for an exclusive license to such candidates.
118
Table of Contents
•
A right of first offer and last look protections for any third party merger and acquisition transactions involving Perspective for a twelve-month period.
None of these options and rights have been exercised as of December 31, 2024.
Costs of IPR&D projects acquired as part of an asset acquisition that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred, and therefore, a charge of $
28.0
 million was recognized in research and development expenses during the first quarter of 2024.
Also effective January 8, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Perspective to transfer the Somerset Facility and the associated assets at the Somerset Facility for $
8.0
 million. The transfer of the sublease and completion of the asset sale occurred on March 1, 2024 at which time the Company had no further continuing legal obligations related to the lease. See Note 7, 
“Property, Plant and Equipment, Net” 
to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.
On June 14, 2024 Perspective effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, after which the Company held 
11,677,339
 shares of Perspective’s common stock. 
On June 15, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Radiopharm to acquire all of Radiopharm’s rights to 
two
 licensed preclinical assets for an upfront payment of $
2.0
 million. The Company acquired global exclusive rights to both an LRRC15-targeted monoclonal antibody (“LRRC15”) and to a Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (“TROP2”)-targeted nanobody. LRRC15 is a potential first-in-class, highly specific monoclonal antibody radio-conjugate with both Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA for the treatment of osteosarcoma. The agent is designed to target the surrounding tumor micro-environment cells expressing the protein potentially treating a broad range of cancers. The TROP2-targeted nanobody radio-conjugate is designed to target TROP2, an intracellular calcium signal transducer that is overexpressed in various types of adenocarcinomas with minimal expression in normal tissues and is associated with tumor aggressiveness, poor prognosis and drug resistance.
In connection with this acquisition, the Company assumed the underlying license agreements related to the two preclinical assets, together with their respective milestone and royalty payment obligations. The Company could pay up to an additional $
20.0
 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones. The Company could also pay up to an additional $
6.5
 million in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual commercial sales thresholds in the event the Company pursues commercialization, as well as royalty payments for commercial sales. Costs of IPR&D projects acquired as part of an asset acquisition that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred, and therefore, a charge of $
2.0
 million was recognized in research and development expenses during 2024 related to the Radiopharm transaction.
The Company also entered an agreement with Radiopharm to make an initial equity investment of approximately $
5.0
 million to purchase 
149,625,180
 Radiopharm shares (the “Initial Shares”) at the fair market offering price of $
0.03
 per share upon the receipt of required approvals from Radiopharm’s shareholders, which were obtained during the third quarter of 2024. Included within the agreement is an option for the Company to invest an additional $
5.0
 million within six months of the issuance date of the Initial Shares on the same terms as the Company’s initial purchase, which would result in the Company purchasing approximately an additional 
149,925,040
 Radiopharm shares. No additional shares were purchased under the option during the three months ended December 31, 2024.
On June 18, 2024, the Company acquired Meilleur, including its asset NAV-4694, an investigational F-18-labeled PET imaging agent that targets beta amyloids in Alzheimer’s disease. The Company determined that upon review of the Meilleur acquisition, the transaction did not meet the definition of a business combination and is therefore treated as an asset acquisition. 
The Company made an upfront payment of approximately $
32.9
 million to the stockholders of Meilleur (“Meilleur Stockholders”) on June 18, 2024 and paid an additional $
10.0
 million in August 2024 after the successful completion of a technology transfer. The Company could pay up to an additional $
43.0
 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. regulatory milestones related to NAV-4694. The Meilleur Stockholders are also eligible to receive up to $
830.0
 million in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual commercial sales thresholds of NAV-4694 as well as up to $
4.0
 million in remaining research milestones upon achievement of specified clinical studies at academic institutions thresholds. Research revenue is derived from existing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that use NAV-4694 in clinical trials. Additionally, the Company could pay the Meilleur Stockholders up to double-digit royalty payments for research revenue and commercial sales. 
On July 3, 2024, the Company acquired from Life Molecular Imaging Ltd. (“Life Molecular”) the global rights to RM2, a gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (“GRPR”)-targeting agent, including the associated novel, clinical-stage radiotherapeutic and radiodiagnostic pair, referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-RM2 and 68Ga-DOTA-RM2, for an upfront payment of $
35.0
 million plus a $
1.0
 million payment made prior to the acquisition. The Company could pay up to an additional 
132.5
 million Euros in regulatory milestone payments upon achievement of clinical trial thresholds and approvals in different regions. The Company could pay up to 
280.0
 million Euros in sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual commercial sales threshold of RM2 in the event the Company pursues commercialization. Additionally, the Company could pay up to 
25.0
 million Euros for collaboration payments inclusive of all costs including employee costs, payments due to certain universities, out-of-pocket expenses and services costs, as well as up to 
5.0
 million Euros for any additional development services performed by Life Molecular through July 3, 2026.

Costs of IPR&D projects acquired as part of an asset acquisition that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred, and therefore, a charge of $
36.0
 million was recognized in research and development expenses during 2024 related to the Life Molecular acquisition. Global rights are exclusive for therapeutic fields in all countries and diagnostic fields in the Americas and co-exclusive with Life Molecular for diagnostic fields outside of the Americas.

Segment Information
The Company operates as 
one
 business segment. The results of this operating segment are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM does not manage any part of the Company separately, and the allocation of resources and assessment of performance are based on the Company’s consolidated operating results. In order to evaluate the reportable segment’s performance, the CODM uses net income and gross margin based on the consolidated statements of operations. The CODM uses net income to monitor budget and forecast versus actual results in assessing segment performance and to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding how to allocate resources. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total consolidated assets.
Significant segment expenses reviewed by the CODM on a monthly basis include sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development expenses as reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. However, the CODM reviews research and development expenses in more detail for certain expenses related to the Company’s development of new products and clinical programs. 
The approximate disaggregated amounts that comprise research and development expenses regularly reviewed by the CODM are as follows:

Subsequent Events
Pending Acquisition of Life Molecular
On January 13, 2025, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Life Molecular, a subsidiary of Life Healthcare Group Holdings Ltd. Life Molecular is based in Berlin, Germany and is dedicated to advancing novel PET radiopharmaceutical diagnostics. The definitive agreement provides for an upfront payment of $
350.0
 million and up to an additional $
400.0

On January 27, 2025, the Company announced that it entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Evergreen Merger Agreement”) with Evergreen Theragnostics, Inc.

Pursuant to the Evergreen Merger Agreement, the Company will pay an upfront payment of $

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of the period covered by this report.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report is set forth below:
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lantheus Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lantheus Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
We are continually monitoring and assessing the geopolitical environment to determine any potential impact on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
