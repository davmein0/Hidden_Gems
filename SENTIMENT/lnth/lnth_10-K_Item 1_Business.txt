Item 1. Business
Overview
We are the leading radiopharmaceutical-focused company, delivering life-changing science to enable clinicians to Find, Fight and Follow disease to deliver better patient outcomes. We classify our products in three categories: Radiopharmaceutical Oncology, Precision Diagnostics, and Strategic Partnerships and Other Revenue. Our leading Radiopharmaceutical Oncology products help healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) Find, Fight and Follow cancer. Our leading Precision Diagnostic products assist HCPs to Find and Follow diseases, with a focus in cardiology. Our Strategic Partnerships include biomarkers and digital solutions in support of our partners’ therapeutic development, out-licensing agreements for non-core assets and optimization of our assets geographically. 
Our commercial products are used by cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, nuclear medicine physicians, oncologists, radiologists, sonographers, technologists, and urologists working in a variety of clinical settings. We believe that our diagnostic products provide information that enables HCPs to better detect and characterize, or rule out, disease, with the potential to achieve better patient outcomes, reduce patient risk, and limit overall costs. 
We produce and market our products throughout the United States (the “United States” or the “U.S.”), selling primarily to hospitals, independent diagnostic testing facilities, and radiopharmacies. We sell our products outside the U.S. through a combination of direct distribution in Canada and third party distribution relationships in Europe, Canada, Australia, Asia-Pacific, Central America and South America.
Our executive offices are located in Bedford, Massachusetts, with additional offices in North Billerica, Massachusetts; Montreal, Canada and Lund, Sweden.
Chief Executive Officer Transition
On March 1, 2024, Brian Markison, became our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Mary Anne Heino retired as our CEO and became the Chair of our Board of Directors (“Board”). As part of this leadership transition, Mr. Markison assumed the role of Executive Chair of the Board as of January 23, 2024 until the effectiveness of his CEO appointment in March 2024, and Board Member Julie McHugh became Lead Independent Director.
Evolution into Fully-Integrated, Radiopharmaceutical Company
During 2024, we executed on our strategy to evolve into a fully integrated radiopharmaceutical company, supported by our increasingly diversified portfolio and our targeted initiatives to expand our pipeline, commercial, development and manufacturing capabilities. Over the course of the year and into 2025, we announced multiple strategic transactions, which further our goals to focus on new high growth markets and expand and diversify our capabilities and development pipeline with complementary assets. A brief description of these transactions is summarized below. 
Pending Acquisition of Life Molecular Imaging
On January 13, 2025, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Life Molecular. Life Molecular is based in Berlin, Germany and is dedicated to advancing novel PET radiopharmaceutical diagnostics. The definitive agreement provides for an upfront payment of $350.0 million and up to an additional $400.0 million in potential earn-out and milestone payments. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary regulatory and closing conditions. This acquisition would enable us to establish a commercial franchise in Alzheimer’s disease, expand our growth profile with Neuraceq, an approved Alzheimer’s disease radiodiagnostic, enhance our research and development and clinical development capabilities, and strengthen our innovative radiodiagnostic pipeline.
Previously, on July 3, 2024,we acquired from Life Molecular the global rights to its clinical stage RM2, a gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (“GRPR”)-targeting agent, including the associated novel, clinical-stage radiotherapeutic and radiodiagnostic pair, previously referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-RM2 and 68Ga-DOTA-RM2 (and which we now refer to as LNTH-2402 and LNTH-2401, respectively), for an upfront payment of $35.0 million plus a $1.0 million payment made prior to the acquisition, and potential regulatory milestone payments plus royalties (the “RM2 Asset Purchase”). GRPR is a member of the bombesin G protein-coupled receptor family, which has been found to be overexpressed in multiple cancers, including prostate, breast and lung. First-in-human dosimetry showed a favorable safety and dosimetry profile and confirmed preclinical data demonstrating dose-dependent efficacy of LNTH-2402. We intend to begin a Phase 1/2a study with LNTH-2402 in prostate cancer patients in 2025. We expect LNTH-2401 could be used as a companion diagnostic, and that together, LNTH-2401 and LNTH-2402 could potentially allow us to enter into new disease areas.
For more information on the acquisition of the global rights to RM2, see Note 21,

Pending Acquisition of Evergreen Theragnostics
On January 27, 2025, we announced that we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Evergreen Merger Agreement”) with Evergreen and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we will acquire Evergreen by means of a statutory merger of our subsidiary with and into Evergreen, with Evergreen surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Evergreen Merger”). Evergreen is a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical company engaged in contract development and manufacturing services, as well as drug discovery and commercialization of proprietary products. Our acquisition of Evergreen would enhance our capabilities across the radiopharmaceutical value chain, specifically strengthening our clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities in therapeutic oncology; expand our late-stage pipeline with a registrational-stage PET diagnostic agent that could complement PNT2003; and grow our early-stage pipeline with multiple clinical and pre-clinical theranostic pairs.
Acquisition of NAV-4694
On June 18, 2024, we acquired Meilleur Technologies, Inc. (“Meilleur”), including its asset NAV-4694, an investigational F-18-PET imaging agent that targets beta amyloids in Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid the stockholders of Meilleur (“Meilleur Stockholders”) an upfront payment of $32.9 million and an additional $10.0 million payment in August 2024 after the successful completion of a technology transfer. We could pay additional milestone payments upon achievement of specified U.S. regulatory milestones related to NAV-4694. We could also pay double-digit milestone payments upon achievement of specified annual commercial sales and double-digit royalty payments for research revenue and commercial sales. Research revenue is derived from partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that use NAV-4694 in clinical trials.

Strategic Agreements with Perspective Therapeutics, Inc.
On January 8, 2024, we entered into multiple strategic agreements with Perspective, a radiopharmaceutical company that is pursuing advanced treatment applications for cancers throughout the body. Under the agreements, we obtained an option to exclusively license Perspective’s Pb212-VMT- ⍺-NET, a clinical stage alpha therapy in development for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, and an option to co-develop certain early-stage therapeutic candidates targeting prostate cancer using Perspective’s innovative platform technology for an aggregate upfront payment of $28.0 million in cash. 
On March 1, 2024, we transferred the fixed assets and associated lease of our Somerset, New Jersey facility to Perspective, and the parties entered into a transition services arrangement pursuant to which 
we provided certain services relating to final disposal of radioactive waste and certain other related services. 
During 2024, we also purchased an aggregate of 11,677,339 shares of Perspective’s common stock (the “Perspective Shares”), after giving effect to a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, resulting in the Company holding approximately 19.9% of Perspective’s outstanding common stock (or 17.35% on a fully diluted basis) as of March 6, 2024.

Other Notable Transactions
Prior to 2024, we executed on some additional transactions that are notable to our business, including the following:
Exclusive License for PNT2002 & PNT 2003
On December 20, 2022, we announced the closing of a set of strategic collaborations with POINT Biopharma Global Inc. (“POINT”), in which we were granted a license to exclusive worldwide rights (excluding Japan, South Korea, China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), Singapore, and Indonesia) to co-develop and commercialize POINT’s PNT2002 and PNT2003 product 
5
Table of Contents
candidates. PNT2002 is a PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy in development for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”). PNT2003 is a somatostatin receptor (“SSTR”) therapy with non-carrier added lutetium-177, which is in registration to treat patients with SSTR-positive neuroendocrine tumors.
On December 27, 2023, Lilly announced the completion of its acquisition of POINT. The acquisition has not impacted the status of the license agreements related to these product candidates or the work being performed in connection with those license agreements and our collaboration with POINT.
PNT2002
POINT is generally responsible for funding and development activities required for FDA approval of PNT2002, including generating all clinical and nonclinical data, analysis and other information, and we are responsible for preparing for and seeking regulatory approval, as well as performing and funding all future development and commercialization following such approval. POINT will be responsible for all manufacturing of PNT2002, subject to certain exceptions described in the license and collaboration agreement between the Company and POINT, dated November 11, 2022 (the “PNT2002 License Agreement”).
The Phase 3 registrational clinical trial for PNT2002 (“SPLASH”) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PNT2002 in patients with mCRPC who have progressed following treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (“ARPI”). On December 18, 2023, we announced that the SPLASH trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a median radiographic progression-free survival (“rPFS”) per blinded independent central review of 9.5 months for patients treated with PNT2002, compared to 6 months for patients treated with ARPI in the control arm, a statistically significant 29% reduction in the risk of radiographic progression or death (hazard ratio (“HR”) 0.71; p=0.0088). At the time of the analysis, interim overall survival (“OS”) results were immature (46% of protocol pre-specified target OS events reached), and the HR was 1.11. On September 15, 2024, we presented additional clinical data from initial topline results of SPLASH during the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress 2024. On November 6, 2024, we announced that the second interim analysis performed at 75% of protocol pre-specified overall survival events demonstrated results for both rPFS and OS that did not materially change from the interim analysis that was performed at 46% of pre-specified events. The OS results and HR in the intent-to-treat population remain confounded by the overwhelming number of patients who crossed over to receive PNT2002. Crossover adjusted analyses were post-hoc, and we are continuing to review the data and perform additional subset analyses in collaboration with our partner in preparation for further interactions on our path forward.
PNT2002 demonstrated a favorable safety profile compared to patients treated with ARPI in the control arm. Only 3.0% of patients treated with PNT2002 halted or reduced therapy as a result of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”), compared to 11.5% of patients treated with ARPI, and 17.1% of PNT2002 patients experienced serious TEAEs compared to 23.1% of ARPI patients.
The open-label study randomized 412 patients with PSMA-expressing mCRPC who had progressed on ARPI therapy and either refused or were not eligible for chemotherapy, in a 2:1 randomization ratio. At the time of the first interim analysis, 84.6% of patients who experienced progressive disease in the control arm subsequently crossed over to receive PNT2002. SPLASH was conducted across the United States, Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom. Eighty percent of SPLASH patients resided in North America and approximately ten percent of all participants were Black or African American.
In June 2024, Endocyte, Novartis and Purdue Research Foundation sued POINT and Lilly alleging that POINT’s manufacturing and sale of PNT2002 infringes an Endocyte patent. 
PNT2003
POINT is responsible for curating all data, analysis and other information necessary for regulatory approval, and supporting us in the preparation of regulatory filings for PNT2003. We are responsible for preparing for and seeking regulatory approval of all such applications, as well as performing and funding all future development and commercialization following such approval. POINT will be responsible for all manufacturing of PNT2003, subject to certain exceptions described in the license and collaboration agreement between our subsidiary, Lantheus Three and POINT, dated November 11, 2022 (the “PNT2003 License Agreement”). 
On January 11, 2024, we announced that our Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for PNT2003 had been accepted for filing by the FDA. On January 26, 2024, we were sued in the District Court for the District of Delaware by Advanced Accelerator Applications USA, Inc. and Advanced Accelerator Applications SA, each a Novartis entity, for patent infringement in response to our ANDA filing and Paragraph IV certification, consistent with the process established by the Hatch-Waxman Act. Under the terms of the Hatch-Waxman Act, full FDA approval of our ANDA filing could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months. If our filing is stayed for the full 30-month period and we are successful in obtaining FDA approval, we would expect to launch PNT2003 in 2026, although there can be no assurance of that approval or timing. Based on the most recent update to the FDA’s online Paragraph IV database listings, we believe we are the first applicant to have filed a substantially complete ANDA for lutetium Lu 177 dotatate containing a Paragraph IV certification under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. As the first applicant, if our ANDA is approved, we

believe we will be eligible for 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity in the U.S. Upon approval, we believe PNT2003 will be the first radioequivalent to lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, which is indicated for the treatment of somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (“GEP-NETs”), including foregut, midgut, and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors. We define radioequivalent as a radiopharmaceutical whose mechanism of action is determined to be equivalent to that of the reference product by the FDA, or a similar regulator outside the United States.

Additional Information about our Product Categories
Radiopharmaceutical Oncology
PYLARIFY is the most utilized radiopharmaceutical diagnostic agent indicated for PET imaging of PSMA-positive lesions in patients with prostate cancer with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy and in patients with suspected recurrence based on elevated PSA levels. PYLARIFY works by binding to PSMA, a protein that is overexpressed on the surface of more than 90% of primary and metastatic prostate cancer cells. PYLARIFY works with PET/CT technology to produce a combined scan that enables the scan reader to detect and locate the disease.
According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in American men - one in eight American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes and over 3.3 million American men are living with prostate cancer today. Based on estimates from third-party sources regarding the incidence of prostate cancer in men in the U.S., we believe the current market potential for PSMA PET imaging agents in the U.S. for 2025 could be about 525,000 scans, and the total addressable market by 2030 could be approximately 750,000 annual scans.
PYLARIFY is manufactured on a diverse, F-18 distributor supply network of PMFs, ensuring convenient and reliable supply. After being made on a cyclotron at a PMF, the F-18 is then combined with certain chemical ingredients in specially designed chemistry synthesis boxes to manufacture PYLARIFY. The finished PYLARIFY is then quality control tested and transferred to a radiopharmacist who prepares and dispenses patient-specific doses of the final product. Because each PMF manufacturing PYLARIFY is deemed by the FDA to be a separate manufacturing site, each is separately approved by the FDA. As of December 31, 2024, we had activated a total of 62 PMF manufacturing sites in our PMF network, up from 54 activated sites as of December 31, 2023. These additional sites provide geographic breadth, out-the-door time flexibility and added optionality. Overall, we have achieved broad national distribution of PYLARIFY with customers in 48 of 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
In addition to our network of commercial PMFs, we also work with academic medical centers in the U.S. that have radioisotope-producing cyclotrons and that have expressed an interest in manufacturing PYLARIFY. For this initiative, we enter into a fee-for-service arrangement under which the academic medical center manufactures F-18 on its cyclotron and completes the manufacturing process for PYLARIFY. PYLARIFY can then be used by the academic medical center itself, and in some cases distributed to other customers under separate purchase agreements.
Our Healthcare Procedure Coding System code, which enables streamlined billing, went into effect as of January 1, 2022. In addition, effective January 1, 2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) granted transitional pass-through payment status (“TPT Status”) in the hospital outpatient setting for PYLARIFY, enabling traditional Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) to provide separate payment for PYLARIFY in addition to the payment for the PET/CT procedure in that setting. TPT Status for PYLARIFY expired on December 31, 2024.
In November 2024, CMS released the final rule for its calendar year 2025 Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (the “CMS 2025 OPPS Rule”), which recognizes the value and need for broad access in diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals. The rule provides separate payment for those diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals with per day costs greater than $630. Effective January 1, 2025, CMS is maintaining separate payment for PYLARIFY after the expiration of TPT Status for the approximately 20% of patients with traditional Medicare FFS insurance coverage who are treated in the hospital outpatient setting. The calendar year 2025 payment rate for PYLARIFY is listed in Addendum B of the final rule. We plan to continue working with CMS on the potential adoption of payment based on Average Sales Price (“ASP”) in the future. We have been reporting ASP since our first dose sold, helping to provide a clear path forward for CMS to potentially make payments based on ASP instead of mean unit cost (“MUC”).
Our continued growth of PYLARIFY will depend on our ability to clinically and commercially differentiate PYLARIFY from other products on the market and to maintain PYLARIFY as the most utilized PSMA PET imaging agent in a competitive space. PYLARIFY’s current competition is primarily two Gallium-68 (“Ga-68”)-based PSMA imaging agents, an F-18-based PSMA imaging agent, and other non-PSMA-based imaging agents commonly referred to as conventional imaging. The potential for future generic entrants to the market as a result of the expiry of PYLARIFY’s five-year new chemical entity (“NCE”) exclusivity period in 2026, on the fifth anniversary of the FDA’s approval, could generate increased competition for PYLARIFY. Continued growth and revenue contribution from PYLARIFY will also depend on our ability to differentiate PYLARIFY, including through flexible and dependable access to PYLARIFY nationally, a best-in-class customer experience and through long-term strategic contracts.

Precision Diagnostics
DEFINITY is the most utilized ultrasound enhancing agent in the U.S. and is indicated for use in adult and pediatric patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular chamber and to improve the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border. Numerous patient conditions can decrease the quality of images of the left ventricle, the primary pumping chamber of the heart. The term DEFINITY refers to both its activated and non-activated forms.
DEFINITY is a clear, colorless, sterile liquid that, upon activation in a VIALMIX or VIALMIX RFID, medical devices specifically designed for DEFINITY, becomes a homogenous, opaque, milky white injectable suspension of perflutren-containing lipid microspheres. After activation and intravenous injection, DEFINITY opacifies the left ventricular chamber and improves the delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border, or innermost layer of tissue that lines the chamber of the left ventricle. Better visualization of the left ventricle allows clinicians to make more informed decisions about disease status.
Based on estimates from third party sources, we believe there were approximately 27 to 32 million echocardiograms performed in the U.S. in 2023 (the latest time period for which full year data is available). Assuming that between 20% and 30% of echocardiograms produce suboptimal images, as stated in the clinical literature, we estimate that approximately 5 to 10 million echocardiograms in 2023 produced suboptimal images.
Since its launch in 2001, DEFINITY has been used in imaging procedures in more than 28 million echocardiograms throughout the world. In March 2024, we received FDA approval for our supplemental new drug application for the use of DEFINITY in pediatric patients with suboptimal echocardiograms. The FDA decision was based on usage data from three pediatric clinical trials conducted with DEFINITY. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2024, DEFINITY had over 80% share of the U.S. segment for ultrasound enhancing agents in echocardiography procedures. DEFINITY currently competes with two other FDA-approved ultrasound enhancing agents, as well as echocardiography without the use of ultrasound enhancing agents and non-echocardiography imaging modalities. DEFINITY and the other FDA-approved ultrasound enhancing agents all carry an FDA-required boxed warning, which has been modified over time, to notify physicians and patients about potentially serious safety concerns or risks posed by the products. See Part I, Item 1A. 
“Risk Factors-Ultrasound enhancing agents may cause side effects which could limit our ability to sell DEFINITY,” 
of this Form 10-K for more information.
We continue to actively pursue additional patents in connection with DEFINITY, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S. for DEFINITY, we have Orange Book-listed method-of-use patents, the last of which expires in 2037, as well as additional manufacturing patents that are not Orange Book-listed expiring in 2037. The Orange Book-listed patents include a patent on the use of VIALMIX RFID (see below), which expires in 2037; we have submitted additional VIALMIX RFID patent applications in major markets throughout the world.
DEFINITY is activated through the use of medical devices branded as VIALMIX and VIALMIX RFID. The activation rate and time are controlled by VIALMIX RFID through the use of radio-frequency identification technology (“RFID”) to ensure reproducible activation of DEFINITY. The RFID tag, which is affixed to the vial label, enables the DEFINITY vial to be appropriately activated with the VIALMIX RFID activation device. We rely on Jubilant HollisterStier (“JHS”) as a significant supplier of DEFINITY. We also produce DEFINITY in our in-house manufacturing facility at our North Billerica campus.

TechneLite
TechneLite is a self-contained system or generator of Tc-99m, a radioactive isotope with a six hour half-life, used by radiopharmacies to prepare various nuclear imaging agents. Tc-99m results from the radioactive decay of Mo-99, itself a radioisotope with a 66-hour half-life sourced in our supply chain in nuclear research reactors located in Belgium, South Africa and Australia from enriched uranium. The TechneLite generator houses a vertical glass column at its core that contains Mo-99, which degrades to Tc-99m. During our manufacturing process, Mo-99 is added to the column within the generator where it is adsorbed onto alumina powder. The column is sterilized, enclosed in a lead shield and further sealed in a cylindrical plastic container, which is then immediately shipped to our radiopharmacy customers. Because of the half-lives of Mo-99 and Tc-99m, radiopharmacies typically purchase TechneLite generators on a weekly basis pursuant to standing orders.
Our ability to produce and market TechneLite is highly dependent on our supply of Mo-99. See 
“Raw Materials and Supply Relationships—Molybdenum-99” 
below.
TechneLite is currently marketed primarily in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America, largely to radiopharmacies that prepare unit doses of radiopharmaceutical imaging agents and ship these preparations directly to hospitals for administration to patients. 
See Part II, Item 7.

In addition, we previously entered into an agreement with Curium to add PYLARIFY to its U.S. ECLIPSE trial, a multi-center, open-label, randomized Phase 3 trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Curium’s PSMA-targeted therapeutic versus hormone therapy in patients mCRPC. PYLARIFY is being used to determine PSMA-avidity as part of patient selection.
•
We have also entered into several other separate agreements, including with POINT and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which we supply PYLARIFY in connection with their clinical trials. Under a strategic collaboration with the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Consortium (“PCCTC”), a premier multicenter clinical research organization that specializes in prostate cancer research, our artificial intelligence (“AI”) platform is being integrated into PCCTC studies to advance the development and validation of novel AI-enabled biomarkers.

$20.0 million
In excess of $300 million
$30.0 million
In excess of $750 million
$50.0 million
In excess of $1 billion
$75.0 million
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company earned the $15.0 million sales-based milestone payment listed above and did not earn a sales-based milestone payment in 2024. Each sales milestone payment is payable one time only, regardless of the number of times the condition is satisfied. The remaining milestone payments could be made within the same calendar year if the highest sales levels were reached in any single calendar year.
aBSI
aBSI automatically calculates the disease burden of prostate cancer by detecting and classifying bone scan tracer uptakes as metastatic or benign lesions using an artificial neural network. The cloud based aBSI was made available for clinical use in the U.S. on August 5, 2019. In February 2020, Progenics received a CE mark for the standalone workstation model of aBSI, meeting the quality standards set by the European Economic Area. In September 2020, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the use of aBSI as software-as-a-medical device on a GE Healthcare imaging system.

PNT2002
 is an investigational PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy for the treatment of mCRPC. On December 18, 2023, we announced positive topline results from SPLASH, the Phase 3 registrational trial for PNT2002 designed to evaluate superiority to the standard of care in mCRPC pre-chemotherapy patients who have failed one androgen receptor pathway inhibitor. At the time of the analysis, interim OS results were immature (46% of protocol pre-specified target OS events reached), and the HR was 1.11. On September 15, 2024, we presented additional clinical data from initial topline results of SPLASH during the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress 2024. On November 6, 2024, we announced that the second interim analysis performed at 75% of protocol pre-specified OS demonstrated results for both rPFS and OS that did not materially change from the interim analysis that was performed at 46% of pre-specified OS events. Crossover adjusted analyses were post hoc, and we are continuing to review the data and perform additional subset analyses in collaboration with our partner in preparation for further interactions on our path forward. 
•
PNT2003
 is an investigational SSTR therapy with non-carrier added lutetium-177, which is in registration to treat patients with SSTR-positive neuroendocrine tumors. On January 11, 2024, we announced that our ANDA for PNT2003, which included Paragraph IV certification, was accepted for filing by the FDA. Pursuant to the procedure set forth in the Hatch Waxman Act, we were sued for patent infringement by Advanced Accelerator Applications USA, Inc. and Advanced Accelerator Applications SA, each a Novartis entity.

With respect to our medical devices:
•
Progenics received a CE mark for the standalone workstation model of aBSI, meeting the quality standards set by the European Economic Area. In September 2020, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the use of aBSI as software-as-a-medical device on a GE Healthcare imaging system. 
•
EXINI was granted 510(k) clearance by the FDA in the U.S. and received a CE mark in Europe for aPROMISE. We launched aPROMISE under the name PYLARIFY AI in the U.S.
PYLARIFY sales are generated in the U.S. through an internal PYLARIFY sales team, as well as a sales team at some of our PMF partners. Sales of DEFINITY are generated in the U.S. through an internal DEFINITY sales team. While a small portion of our SPECT product sales in the U.S. are generated through our internal sales force to hospitals and clinics that maintain their own in-house radiopharmaceutical preparation capabilities, we primarily sell our SPECT products, including TechneLite, NEUROLITE, Xenon, and CARDIOLITE, to large radiopharmacy chains. We have licensed RELISTOR to Bausch, and while we have sold the right to our RELISTOR net sales royalties under our license agreement, we have retained the rights to future sales-based milestone payments generated by Bausch.
Flurpiridaz F-18 is licensed to GE Healthcare, which is commercializing it as Flyrcado in the United States. We are entitled to milestone and royalty-based payments for Flyrcado.
Seasonality
We have some modest seasonality for our products as patients may seek to schedule diagnostic imaging and other procedures less frequently during the summer vacation months and over the year-end holidays.
Customers
No customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Backlog
Our backlog consists of orders for which a delivery schedule within the next twelve months has been specified. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers at any time with the exception of TechneLite orders. TechneLite customers must provide us with four weeks advanced notice to cancel an order. We do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it has historically been immaterial relative to our consolidated revenues and is not necessarily indicative of future revenues for any given period.

Competition
We believe that our key product characteristics, such as proven efficacy, reliability and safety, coupled with our core competencies, such as our efficient manufacturing processes, our established distribution network, our experienced field sales organization and our customer service focus, are important factors that distinguish us from our competitors.
The markets for our products are highly competitive and continually evolving. Our principal competitors for our current commercial products and leading clinical development candidates include large, global companies that are more diversified than we are and that have substantial financial, manufacturing, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources.
•
For PYLARIFY, our principal competitors are currently Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited, Novartis AG, and Blue Earth Diagnostics Ltd., a subsidiary of Bracco Diagnostics Inc. (“Bracco”); and there is the potential for future competition from others who may submit regulatory applications in anticipation of PYLARIFY’s NCE exclusivity expiry in 2026.
•
For DEFINITY, our competitors currently include GE Healthcare and Bracco.
•
For a number of our SPECT products, our competitors currently include Curium, GE Healthcare, Bracco, and Jubilant Life Sciences, an affiliate of JHS and Jubilant Radiopharma, and potentially BWXT Medical.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. For example, for PNT2003, our principal competitors may include Novartis AG; ITM Radiopharma; Curium, and RayzeBio (acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb). For MK-6240 and NAV-4694, our principal competitors may include Lilly and GE Healthcare.
We cannot anticipate the actions of our current or future competitors in the same or competing modalities, such as significant price reductions on competitive products, development of new products that are more cost-effective or have superior performance than our current or future products, or the introduction of generic versions after our proprietary products lose their patent or regulatory exclusivity protection. In addition, distributors of our products could attempt to shift end-users to competing modalities and products, or bundle the sale of a portfolio of products, in either case to the detriment of our specific products. Our current or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of these activities.
Further, the radiopharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry continues to evolve strategically, with several market participants recently acquired by larger companies that may have more significant resources than ours. In addition, the supply-demand dynamics of the industry are complex because of large market positions of some participants, legacy businesses, government subsidies (in particular, relating to the manufacture of radioisotopes), government reimbursement policies, such as TPT Status, and group purchasing arrangements. We cannot predict what impact new owners and new operators may have on the strategic decision-making of our competitors, customers, and suppliers.
Raw Materials and Supply Relationships
We rely on certain raw materials and supplies to produce our products. Due to the specialized nature of our products and the limited, and sometimes intermittent, supply of raw materials available in the market, we have established relationships with several key suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our largest suppliers of raw materials and supplies were Institute for Radioelements (“IRE”), the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (“ANSTO”), and NTP Radioisotopes (“NTP”), which, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 7.8% of our total purchases and relate specifically to TechneLite.
Molybdenum-99
Our TechneLite, CARDIOLITE and NEUROLITE products all rely on Mo-99, the radioisotope which is produced by bombarding uranium with neutrons in research reactors. With a 66-hour half-life, Mo-99 decays into, among other things, Tc-99m, a radioisotope with a half-life of six hours. Tc-99m is an isotope that is attached to radiopharmaceuticals, including our own NEUROLITE and CARDIOLITE, during the labeling process and is the most common radioisotope used for medical diagnostic imaging purposes.
We currently purchase finished Mo-99 from three of the four main processing sites in the world, namely IRE in Belgium, NTP in South Africa and ANSTO in Australia.
Although we believe we have the most globally diverse Mo-99 supply, we still face supplier and logistical challenges in our Mo-99 supply chain. When one supplier experiences outages, we generally rely on other suppliers to limit the impact of the outages. We believe we effectively manage these various supply chain challenges, but depending on reactor and processor schedules and operations, at times we have not been able to fill some or all of the demand for our TechneLite generators on certain manufacturing days. A prolonged disruption of service from one of our three Mo-99 processing sites or one of their main Mo-99-producing reactors could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
14
Table of Contents
Xenon
Xenon is a by-product of the Mo-99 production process. Under a strategic agreement entered into in 2021, we receive from IRE bulk unprocessed Xenon, which we process and finish for our customers at our North Billerica, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. That contract runs through December 31, 2025, with auto-renewal provisions and is terminable upon notice of non-renewal. Until we can qualify an additional source of bulk unprocessed Xenon, we will rely on IRE as a sole source provider.
Other Materials
We have additional supply arrangements for active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, packaging materials and other materials and components, some of which are sole-sourced, and all of which we currently believe are either in good standing or replaceable without any material disruption to our business.
See Part I, Item 1A. 
“Risk Factors”
 of this Form 10-K for information regarding certain risks associated with our raw materials and supply arrangements.
Manufacturing
The commercial manufacture of PYLARIFY requires us to create a field-based network of specialized PMFs with radioisotope-producing cyclotrons. The radioisotope used in PYLARIFY is F-18, which has a 110 minute half-life, requiring that this agent be manufactured and distributed rapidly to end-users. After being made on a cyclotron at a PMF, the F-18 is combined with certain chemical ingredients in specially designed chemistry synthesis boxes to manufacture PYLARIFY. The finished PYLARIFY is then quality control tested and transferred to a radiopharmacist who prepares and dispenses patient-specific doses from the final product. Because each of the PMFs manufacturing PYLARIFY is deemed by the FDA to be a separate manufacturing site, each requires separate FDA approval.
We have a specialized in-house FDA-approved manufacturing facility at our North Billerica campus for purposes of producing DEFINITY. On February 22, 2022, we received FDA approval of our sNDA, authorizing commercial manufacturing of DEFINITY at our new facility. DEFINITY manufactured at this facility became commercially available on February 23, 2022. We believe this investment provides supply chain redundancy, improved flexibility and reduced costs in a potentially more price competitive environment.
We manufacture TechneLite on an automated production line and we process and finish Xenon on a hot cell line at our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility.
We manufacture, finish and distribute our radiopharmaceutical products on a just-in-time basis, and supply our customers with these products either by next day delivery services or by ground or air custom logistics. 
In addition to our in-house manufacturing capabilities, a substantial portion of our products are manufactured by third party contract manufacturing organizations, and in certain instances, we rely on them for sole source manufacturing. To ensure the quality of the products that are manufactured by third parties, certain of the key raw materials used in those products are first sent to our North Billerica, Massachusetts facility, where we test them prior to the third party manufacturing of the final product. For many of our products, after the final products are manufactured, they are sent back to us for final quality control testing, and then we ship them to our customers. We have expertise in the design, development, and validation of complex manufacturing systems and processes, and our strong execution and quality control culture supports the just-in-time manufacturing model at our facilities.
Manufacturing and Supply Arrangements
We currently have the following technology transfer and manufacturing and supply agreements in place for some of our major products:
•
PYLARIFY
—We have entered into commercial supply agreements with different PMF networks. Our agreements with our PMF networks allow for termination upon the occurrence of specified events, including material breach or bankruptcy by either party, and have various termination dates generally terminating between 2027 and 2030 and subject to renewal provisions.
•
DEFINITY, CARDIOLITE and NEUROLITE
—In February 2022, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with JHS, for the manufacture of DEFINITY, CARDIOLITE, NEUROLITE and evacuation vials, the latter being an ancillary component for our TechneLite generators. The agreement expires on December 31, 2027, and can be renewed upon mutual consent. The agreement allows for termination upon the occurrence of certain events such as a material breach or default by either party, or bankruptcy by either party. The agreement also requires us to order from JHS a specified minimum percentage of our total requirements for DEFINITY, as well as specified quantities of CARDIOLITE, NEUROLITE and evacuation vial products, each year during the contract term.

Intellectual Property Matters
Patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, both in the U.S. and foreign countries, are very important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, technological innovations, licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements and regulatory exclusivities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. 
Description of Patent Rights
Patents grant the legal right to exclude others from practicing an invention. In the United States, patent rights prohibit (subject to certain exceptions) others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the claimed invention without the permission of the patentee.
Patent rights are territorial and must be obtained in every jurisdiction in which protection is desired.

The legal requirements for obtaining a patent vary by jurisdiction and can include the requirement that the claimed subject matter is new (novel) and nonobvious (or inventive). Other requirements, depending on jurisdiction, can include that the invention be adequately described so as to enable others to make and use it, and that the inventors be properly identified.
Patent rights are defined by the claims set forth in the granted patent, which define the scope of the right to exclude others from practicing the patented invention.

Patent infringement arises when a third party practices without authorization, each element of the claims set forth in the granted patent.

It is also possible to indirectly infringe a patent, such as by inducing a third party to directly infringe the patent, or by contributorily infringing by making a material component of the invention that is not subject to any substantial non-infringing use.
Duration of Patent Rights
Patents are granted for limited periods of time.

In the United States, the standard patent term is 20 years from the earliest nonprovisional filing to which the patent claims priority.

The patent term can be extended as a result of delays in the patent office, resulting in patent term adjustment.
In addition, patent term extension can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. 
Patent Litigation
Patent rights are not self-executing and may need to be asserted, such as through litigation.

Litigation typically starts when a patentee sues a defendant alleging infringement of one or more patents.

It can also occur when the target of a perceived patent assertion preemptively files a lawsuit, a so-called declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration by a court that it does not infringe a patent or that the patent is invalid.

In the United States, patent litigation is conducted in federal district court with a right of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and discretionary review by petition to the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the United States, patent cases are generally tried to a jury, with the exception of Hatch-Waxman cases, discussed below, which are tried to a judge.

The judge determines the meaning of disputed claim terms during a process called claim construction.
Patent litigation can be expensive and burdensome, both in terms of time, money, and company resources.

The outcome of patent litigation is always uncertain to varying degrees.

The subject matter is often highly technical and difficult for lay juries, and judges, to understand.

Context is provided by dueling experts about whom the fact-finder must make credibility determinations.

The issue of infringement frequently turns on the construction (interpretation) of particular claim language during a process culminating in a so-called “
Markman Order.”
During patent litigation, the validity of the patents is almost always challenged, because invalidity is a defense to infringement.

Although a patent is presumed valid, this presumption can be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.

In the United States, typical grounds for challenge include lack of novelty or obviousness by introducing evidence of relevant “prior art,” referring to activity that pre-dated the relevant priority dates of the challenged patents.

During litigation, patent challengers often devote significant resources to identifying prior art from repositories around the world, often far exceeding the search capacities and budgets of the patent offices that conducted screening searches before issuing the patents in the first instance.
16
Table of Contents
Other grounds of challenge in the United States include lack of written description and enablement, generally alleging that the full scope of the claimed invention was either not in the possession of the inventor of the time of filing or that one of skill in the art would not have been able to practice the full scope of the invention without undue experimentation.

Both of these inquiries are highly fact-specific. Improper inventorship can be the basis for an invalidity challenge, as can an allegation that the patent is not the subject of statutory subject matter, which is known as a so-called “Section 101” challenge.
Although patent infringement actions are tried in district courts, patent validity can also be challenged in special proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), such as Inter Partes Reviews and Post-Grant Reviews.
Patent-related Aspects of Regulatory Matters
The FDA approval process for drugs is described below, including new drug applications (“NDAs”) for innovator drugs, ANDAs for generics, and 505(b)(2) applications for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA.

See
 “
Regulatory Matters” 
below for more information.

Below is a description of the roles played by patents in relevant regulatory framework.

First, in seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug, which is later published in the Orange Book. The FDA approved drugs listed in the Orange Book can serve as a basis for comparison by the FDA when evaluating the bioequivalence of new generic drugs. An FDA approved drug relied upon for comparison is referred to as a “reference listed drug” (“RLD”) and may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. See
 “Regulatory Matters – Hatch-Waxman Act” 
below

for more information.
With respect to any RLD patents listed in the Orange Book, the applicant must certify to one of the following four items: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new drug.
A certification to the fourth item (a so-called a Paragraph IV certification) constitutes a technical act of patent infringement under the U.S. Patent Laws, which can give rise to litigation to determine whether or not the product, if approved and launched, would infringe the listed patents, and whether those patents are invalid.

The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. The first company or companies to submit an application that (1) is determined by the FDA to be “substantially complete” upon submission and (2) contains a paragraph IV certification to at least one of the patents listed in the Orange Book is generally eligible for the exclusive right to market the generic drug for 180 days.
After filing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant has 45 days from filing to submit a “Notice Letter” to the Orange Book patent holder.

The patent holder can then sue for infringement.

The resulting litigation is known as Hatch-Waxman litigation.

If the patent holder sues for infringement within 45 days of receiving this Notice Letter, the FDA cannot approve the application for 30 months (the so-called “30 month stay”), unless the patents expire in the interim, the lawsuit is settled, or there is decision on the merits favorable to applicant.
Independent of the 30-month stay, the FDA also will not approve a 505(b)(2) NDA or an ANDA application that references an RLD until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the respective RLD has expired. See
 “Regulatory Matters – Hatch-Waxman Act” 
below

for more information.
Trademarks, Service Marks and Trade Names
We own various trademarks, service marks, and trade names, including, among others, PYLARIFY, DEFINITY and Find Fight and Follow. We have generally registered these trademarks, as well as others, in the U.S. and/or numerous foreign jurisdictions.
17
Table of Contents
Trade Secrets
We possess considerable know-how, including trade secrets from which we derive commercial value.

In addition to patents, we rely, where necessary, upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how, proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, consultants and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees.
Intellectual Property Protection on Selected Assets
Our IP assets include patents that we own and those to which we have licenses. We typically seek patent protection in major markets around the world, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Asia, Central America, and South America. 
All patent terms described below are presented without giving effect to any applicable patent term adjustments or regulatory extensions. In addition, a list of Orange Book-listed patents, together with expiration dates, and applicable regulatory exclusivity can be obtained from the FDA through its website. 
Further comments on selected IP assets are below:
PYLARIFY — 
A portfolio of patents protects PYLARIFY, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we continue to pursue additional patent protection. Currently, there are six Orange Book-listed patents for PYLARIFY. Our longest duration Orange Book-listed PYLARIFY patent extends until June 2037. The NCE-1 date for PYLARIFY is May 26, 2025. As described below, this is the date after which the FDA is allowed to accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applications from generic challengers. If this happens, the Company could elect to pursue Hatch-Waxman litigation and trigger the 30-month stay described above, see
 “Intellectual Property Matters – Patent-related Aspects of Regulatory Matters” 
above for more information; during the stay, the FDA is prohibited from approving, other than as a tentative approval, the challenger’s application until the lawsuit is settled or there is a decision on the merits favorable to applicant.
DEFINITY — 
A portfolio of patents protects the use and manufacturing of DEFINITY and also the VIALMIX RFID device, both in the U.S. and internationally. Currently, there are nine Orange Book-listed patents for DEFINITY. Our longest duration Orange Book-listed DEFINITY patent extends until May 2037.
TechneLite — 
We currently own patents in the U.S. and various foreign countries on certain component technology expiring in 2029, and we are pursuing additional patent protection in the U.S. and world-wide on other component technology that, if granted, would expire in 2040. In addition, given the significant know-how and trade secrets associated with the methods of manufacturing and assembling the TechneLite generator, we believe we have a substantial amount of valuable and defensible proprietary intellectual property associated with the product.
aPROMISE — 
U.S. Patents and pending patent applications worldwide relating to automated medical image analysis, have expiration dates ranging from 2037 to 2041.
Other Nuclear Products — 
Neither CARDIOLITE nor NEUROLITE is covered any longer by patent protection. We have patent protection for an improved container for Xenon in the U.S., Canada and Australia that expires in October 2035.
aBSI — 
We own patents relating to automated detection of bone cancer metastases. The patents on this technology expire in the U.S. in 2032 and outside of the U.S. in 2028. Further, we own a U.S. patent and have patent applications that are pending in the U.S. and worldwide relating to aBSI improvements, which have expiration ranging from 2040 to 2041.
flurpiridaz (Flyrcado) — 
We own patents and patent applications in numerous jurisdictions covering composition, use, formulation, and manufacturing, including in the U.S. a composition of matter patent expiring in 2026, a formulation patent expiring in 2032, a method-of-use patent expiring in 2028, and manufacturing-related patents expiring in 2031 and 2033, and various patent applications, some of which, if granted, will expire in 2033.

“Risk Factors”
 of this Form 10-K for information regarding certain risks associated with our intellectual property.
Regulatory Matters 
Food and Drug Laws
The development, manufacture and commercialization of our products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the U.S. A number of factors substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. These factors include governmental regulation, such as detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing, advertising and promotion, sampling, distribution, import and export, record keeping and storage and disposal practices, together with various post-marketing requirements. Governmental regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale, as well as other civil or criminal sanctions.
Our activities related to the development, manufacture, packaging, or repackaging of our products subject us to a wide variety of laws and regulations. We are required to register for permits and/or licenses with, seek approvals from and comply with operating and security standards of, the FDA, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Canada, the European Medicines Agency, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the NMPA and various state and provincial boards of pharmacy, state and provincial controlled substance agencies, state and provincial health departments and/or comparable state and provincial agencies, as well as foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.
The FDA and various state regulatory authorities regulate the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket approval, marketing, advertising and promotion, import and export, and sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. Prior to marketing a pharmaceutical product, we must first receive FDA approval. In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Currently, the process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•
Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to current Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
•
Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin, including review and approval by any institutional review board (“IRB”), serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical trials;
•
Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to current Good Clinical Practices and other requirements, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use;
•
Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug or ANDA for a generic drug;
•
Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) regulations; and
•
FDA review and approval of the NDA or ANDA.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our products in development will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Once a pharmaceutical product is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation, and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. This testing culminates in the submission of the IND to the FDA.
Once the IND becomes effective, including review and approval by any IRB serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical trial, the clinical trial program may begin. Each new clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the FDA before the trial may begin. The person, entity or organization taking responsibility for the trial is referred to as the clinical trial sponsor. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
19
Table of Contents
•
Phase 1.
 The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with those diseases.
•
Phase 2.
 Involves trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
•
Phase 3.
 Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to collect sufficient safety and efficacy data to support the NDA for FDA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. Submissions must also be made to inform the FDA of certain changes to the clinical trial protocol. Federal law also requires the sponsor to register the trials on public databases when they are initiated, and to disclose the results of the trials on public databases upon completion. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, any IRB serving any of the institutions participating in the clinical trial can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at an institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Failure to register a clinical trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug product, proposed labeling, and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee. A waiver of that fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The FDA may on occasion require the sponsor of an NDA to conduct additional clinical trials or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delay or expense. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. The FDA also may impose one or more Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. A REMS could add training requirements for healthcare professionals, safety communications efforts and limits on channels of distribution, among other things. The sponsor would be required to evaluate and monitor the various REMS activities and adjust them if need be. Whether a REMS would be imposed on any of our products and any resulting financial impact is uncertain at this time.
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an Orphan Drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. 
In the United States, Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period 
20
Table of Contents
of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on drug products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved label and promotional claims must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Drug product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain other agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. In addition, manufacturers of commercial PET products such as PYLARIFY, including radiopharmacies, hospitals, and academic medical centers, are required to submit either an NDA or ANDA in order to produce PET drugs for clinical use, or produce the drugs under an IND.
The FDA also regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, import/export and advertising and promotion of any medical devices that we distribute pursuant to the FDCA and FDA’s implementing regulations. The Federal Trade Commission shares jurisdiction with the FDA over the promotion and advertising of certain medical devices. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of medical devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing. Currently, medical devices comprise only a small portion of our revenues.
The FDA may withdraw marketing authorization for a product if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amount of testing and documentation required for approval or clearance of new drugs and devices, all of which add to the expense of product introduction and the cost of continuing to make an approved drug or device available. Later discovery of previously-unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, civil monetary penalties, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may also increase our costs or reduce sales or otherwise adversely impact our products. 
Because our operations include the manufacture and distribution of medical radioisotopes and other medical products, we are subject to regulation by the NRC and the departments of health of each state in which we operate and the applicable state boards of pharmacy. In addition, the FDA is also involved in the regulation of cyclotron facilities where PET products are produced in compliance with cGMP requirements and U.S. Pharmacopeia requirements for PET drug compounding.
Drug laws also are in effect in the non-U.S. markets in which we or our partners conduct business. These laws range from comprehensive drug approval requirements to requests for product data or certifications. In addition, inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of adverse events, are components of most of these regulatory systems. Our business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we or our partners operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. 
21
Table of Contents
To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable FDA, NRC and other state, federal and foreign regulatory requirements, we regularly review our quality systems to assess their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. As part of our quality review, we perform assessments of our suppliers of the raw materials that are incorporated into products and conduct quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of our products. From time to time, we may determine that products we manufactured or marketed do not meet our specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the International Standards Organization, or regulatory requirements. When a quality or regulatory issue is identified, we investigate the issue and take appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of revised labeling and other actions.
Hatch-Waxman Act
The Hatch-Waxman Act added two pathways for FDA drug approval. First, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits the FDA to approve ANDAs for generic versions of drugs if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator product and provides relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data. See 
“Intellectual Property Matters,” 
above for more information. Second, the Hatch-Waxman Act created what is known as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which requires the same information as a full NDA (known as a Section 505(b)(1) NDA), including full reports of clinical and preclinical studies but allows some of the information from the reports required for marketing approval to come from studies which the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA permits a manufacturer to obtain marketing approval for a drug without needing to conduct or obtain a right of reference for all of the studies that would be required for a Section 505(b)(1) NDA submission. 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA can approve ANDAs for generic versions of drugs before the expiration of an Orange Book-listed patent covering the innovator product if the ANDA applicant demonstrates, among other things, that (i) its generic candidate is the same as the innovator product by establishing bioequivalence and providing relevant chemistry, manufacturing and product data, and (ii) either the marketing of that generic candidate does not infringe the Orange Book-listed patent(s) or the Orange Book-listed patent(s) is invalid. Similarly, the FDA can approve a Section 505(b)(2) NDA from an applicant that relies on some of the information required for marketing approval to come from studies which the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference. An applicant submitting an application relying on either the ANDA or this Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway must also give Notice to the innovator, which would then enable the innovator to file suit against the applicant within 45 days of receiving the Notice. If the innovator challenges the applicant in court in a timely manner, then FDA approval to commercialize the generic candidate will be stayed (that is, delayed) for up to 30 months while the dispute is resolved in court. The 30-month stay can be shortened if the patent infringement suit is resolved in the applicant’s favor before the 30-month stay expires, and this may involve a successful challenge of the patent’s validity in USPTO proceedings and appeals process. In the event a 505(b)(2) applicant does not rely on studies related to the innovator product, the 30-month stay would not apply, but additional clinical trials may be required by the FDA for approval. We can give no assurance that we would have grounds to file a patent infringement suit, that we would obtain the full 30-month stay, that we would be successful on the merits asserting that an Applicant infringes our Orange Book-listed patent, or that we would be successful defending the validity of our Orange Book-listed patent in court or in a USPTO adversarial proceeding if a third party were to submit an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA application to the FDA in connection with one of our commercial products.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for: (1) restoration of a portion of a product’s patent term that was lost during clinical development and application review by the FDA; and (2) statutory protection, known as exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Under U.S. law, patent term extension can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Patent term extensions, however, are subject to a maximum extension of five years, and the patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the USPTO in conjunction with the FDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for a period of statutory protection for new drugs that receive NDA approval from the FDA. If the FDA approves a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for a new drug that is an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, then the Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the submission or approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for a period of five years from the date of approval of the NDA, except that the FDA may accept an application for review after four years under certain circumstances, specifically a patent challenge for one or more patents listed by the NDA holder in the Orange Book, submitted in a “Paragraph IV” Certification. Because this four-year date occurs one year before the end of the five-year NCE exclusivity, it is commonly referred to as the “NCE-1” date.
The Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of a full NDA, as opposed to an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA, for any drug, but the competitor would be required to conduct its own clinical trials, and any use of the drug for which marketing approval is sought could not violate another NDA holder’s patent claims. 
22
Table of Contents
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a three-year period of exclusivity for an NDA for a new drug containing an active moiety that was previously approved by the FDA, but also includes new clinical data (other than bioavailability and bioequivalence studies) to support an innovation over the previously-approved drug and those studies were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period does not prohibit the FDA from accepting an application from a third party for a drug with that same innovation, but it does prohibit the FDA from approving that application for the three-year period. The three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA, with limited exceptions, from approving generic drugs containing the same active ingredient but without the new innovation.
Reimbursement
The successful commercialization of our products is also subject to the availability of appropriate third-party coding, coverage, and payment for our customers. Third-party payors in the U.S. include private payors, including managed care providers, and State and Federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Coverage of a product does not ensure there will be an appropriate reimbursement amount for such product and the process to ensure appropriate reimbursement is outside our control. For private payors, coverage and reimbursement of our products vary from private payor to private payor. Many private payors, such as managed care providers, manage access to products, and may use medical policies (which may include specific coverage requirements such as prior authorization, re-authorization and achieving performance metrics under value-based contracts) to control utilization. Exclusion from or restriction in coverage can reduce product use. For government payors, we participate, as required, in the Medicaid drug rebate program, the Federal Supply Schedule and the Public Health Service Act 340B program, which each require discounts for participation and may be subject to change. For Medicare, reimbursement to customers for our products is generally established through the rulemaking process or in discussion with Medicare Administrative Contractors. We have ongoing conversations with third-party payors to advocate for appropriate coding, coverage and payment for our portfolio of products.
Medicare Outpatient TPT Status
Part B of the Medicare program generally reimburses medical services and supplies, including drugs, provided to beneficiaries by physicians and other qualified healthcare professionals. Generally, drugs furnished “incident to” a physician’s service in the hospital outpatient setting of care are reimbursed at ASP plus a certain additional percent, unless the product is treated as a “supply” in the performance of the procedure and “packaged” and paid as part of bundled payment for the procedure. New drugs, however, may apply for TPT Status in which case they are provided a separate payment at ASP plus a certain additional percent for two to three years, regardless of whether they would ordinarily be packaged. TPT Status applies to approximately 20% of patients with traditional Medicare FFS insurance coverage who are treated in the hospital outpatient setting. Since 2008, under the hospital outpatient program, diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals have been considered supplies and their payment bundled into the payment for the procedure after expiration of TPT Status. In November 2024, CMS released the CMS 2025 OPPS Rule to pay separately for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, such as PYLARIFY, with a per day cost greater than $630, based on their MUC. MUC differs from ASP as it is an indirect measure of a product’s cost based on hospital-reported claims data. We believe MUC is a less accurate reflection of actual purchasing costs of the hospital.
PYLARIFY’s TPT Status was effective from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, providing separate payment to customers using PYLARIFY in the hospital outpatient setting during that period. Effective January 1, 2025, under the CMS 2025 OPPS Rule, CMS is maintaining separate payment for PYLARIFY for the approximately 20% of patients with traditional Medicare FFS insurance coverage who are treated in the hospital outpatient setting. The reimbursement rate for PYLARIFY was initially based on the wholesale acquisition cost plus three percent until ASP could be established. In 2023, CMS established an ASP for PYLARIFY and reimbursed at a rate equal to ASP plus an add-on percentage that varied throughout the year. The calendar year 2025 payment rate for PYLARIFY is based on MUC, which will lead to a decrease in payment in 2025 relative to previous ASP-based payment methodologies. PYLARIFY’s MUC payment rate is based on charges reported by hospitals in claims data that CMS uses to set payment rates. Hospitals report their charges related to the goods and services provided and CMS applies a specific cost-to-charge ratio to estimate the true costs. Issues arise because hospitals do not apply uniform mark-ups to all items, and higher cost items and services, such as PYLARIFY, tend to have smaller mark-ups, which often leads to an underestimation of a product’s true cost. Additionally, product billing errors may lead to an underestimation of total cost. We believe these factors cause a misalignment between ASP and MUC, and therefore, a decrease in payment. In rulemaking, CMS has indicated a willingness to move to ASP-based payment for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals in future years, and we plan to continue to work with CMS on the potential adoption of payment based on ASP in the future.

Healthcare Reform and Other Laws Affecting Payment
We operate in a highly regulated industry. The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation that may affect the availability and cost of healthcare. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Healthcare Reform Act”), substantially changed the way in which healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that affect coverage, reimbursement and/or delivery of drug products and the medical imaging procedures in which our drug products are used. 
The Healthcare Reform Act has been subject to political and judicial challenges, but it has generally withstood such challenges, and the main provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act remain in effect. More recently, Congress enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) which significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Among other provisions, the IRA authorizes Medicare to negotiate pricing for the highest Medicare-spend drugs, as determined by their Medicare Part B and D spend, that have been on the market for an extended period of time without market competition. Although the IRA provides for a limited number of categorical exclusions from Medicare negotiation, radiopharmaceuticals are not among those categorical exclusions. CMS will implement the first year of Medicare negotiation, which will be restricted to Part D drugs, starting in calendar years 2026 and 2027. In addition, the statute provided for redesign of the Medicare Part D benefit. We are currently focused on drugs that are covered under Part B, therefore we do not expect the Part D benefit redesign to have an impact on our portfolio. Part B drugs will be considered for Medicare negotiation beginning in calendar year 2028, and CMS will begin the process of identifying Part B drugs for negotiation as early as calendar year 2026. We are monitoring the implementation of the IRA to determine what impact, if any, this would have on our current products and product candidates in development.
The IRA also introduces rebate obligations for manufacturers of Part B and D drugs that take price increases which exceed the rate of inflation, similar to the longstanding Medicaid inflation rebates. Under these new Medicare inflation rebates, each Part B and D single-source drug/biological and biosimilar will have an “inflation adjusted” payment amount calculated by CMS. If the manufacturer’s price increases for the relevant product exceeds the inflation adjusted payment amount, as trended forward by the rate of inflation, the manufacturer will be required to reimburse Medicare the difference between what Medicare paid for the product and what it would have paid based on the inflation adjusted payment amount.
Recent state legislative efforts seek to address drug costs and generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Some of those efforts have been subject to legal challenge.
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products (or services provided by healthcare providers using our products). The Budget Control Act, as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers beginning in 2013 and will remain in effect through fiscal year 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The imposition of the 2% payment adjustment had been suspended through March 31, 2022 and went into effect as of April 1, 2022. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.
24
Table of Contents
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The Healthcare Reform Act clarifies the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, providing that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act revised the FCA to provide that a claim arising from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is, therefore, a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback statutes or similar laws.
Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). As discussed, a claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the U.S. federal government and various states, as well as by countries outside of the U.S., to regulate the sales and marketing practices of certain entities including pharmaceutical and device manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure by pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to the government and/or public of financial interactions or other financial relationships with health care providers and other entities such as teaching hospitals (so-called “sunshine laws”). The Healthcare Reform Act requires manufacturers to submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. The laws and regulations include requirements that can be unclear in their scope, nature, and required implementation by regulated entities. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, in the U.S. or in countries outside the U.S., we could be subject to penalties and administrative actions under such laws and regulations.
Data Privacy, Security and Breach Notification
We are subject to data protection laws and regulations that set forth data privacy, security, and breach notification requirements. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on data protection and other data privacy and security issues. Data protection laws and regulations can be complex and are becoming more stringent over time. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition to establishing restrictions on how personal information may be collected, used, and disclosed, these laws and regulations provide various rights to data subjects with respect to their personal information and establish requirements for how personal information must be secured. In addition, every state in the United States now has a data breach notification law that requires regulated entities to report certain security breaches to affected data subjects, regulators, or other entities. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties and requirements to take corrective actions), private litigation (which may result in the award of damages against us), and/or adverse publicity, and could negatively affect our operating results, business, and reputation. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are themselves subject to privacy, security, and breach notification requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, “HIPAA”). While we believe that we are neither a “covered entity” nor “business associate” subject directly to regulation under HIPAA, HIPAA’s criminal provisions can apply to entities other than “covered entities” or “business associates” in certain circumstances. Accordingly, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted.

In addition, a growing number of jurisdictions outside of the United States have enacted robust data protection laws. Certain of these laws have extraterritorial application. For example, the processing of personal data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to an entity established in the European Union (“EU”) and extraterritorially to an entity outside of the EU that offers goods or services to, or monitors the behavior of, individuals located in the EU. Certain “special categories” of personal data, including data concerning health, are subject to enhanced protections under the GDPR. This regulation imposes several requirements on the controllers and processors of personal data, including the obligation to comply with various rights that individuals have with respect to their personal data and restrictions on the processing of personal data, and to provide notice of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in significant fines and other administrative penalties.
In the United States, several state legislatures are considering enacting or have enacted new data privacy legislation. One example of such legislation that has already been passed is the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes many requirements on certain for-profit businesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA’s requirements are similar to those found in the GDPR, including requiring businesses to provide notice to data subjects regarding the information collected about them and how such information is used and shared, and providing data subjects various rights, such as the right to request access to their personal information and, in certain cases, request the erasure of such personal information. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information. In addition, the CCPA requires regulated businesses to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to protect personal information. The CCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements. It also provides California residents a private right of action, including the ability to seek statutory damages, in the event of a breach involving their personal information resulting from a business’s failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices. Compliance with the CCPA, and similar laws implemented in other states, is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
On November 3, 2020, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) through a ballot initiative. The CPRA amends the CCPA and expands its protections for personal information, including by establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce the CPRA and by providing California consumers various rights such as the right to restrict the processing of their “sensitive personal information.” The CPRA’s amendments to the CCPA took effect on January 1, 2023, and generally apply to personal information collected by regulated businesses on or after January 1, 2022.
Antitrust and Competition Laws
The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit specific types of anti-competitive conduct, including price fixing, wage fixing, concerted refusals to deal, price discrimination and tying arrangements, as well as monopolization and acquisitions of competitors that have, or may have, a substantial adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we are subject to similar antitrust and anti-competition laws in foreign countries. We believe we are in compliance with such laws, however, any violation could create a substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in both foreign and domestic markets. 
Laws Relating to Foreign Trade
We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
Those laws also include the U.K. Bribery Act (“Bribery Act”) which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.

Our policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. Our operations reach many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods, currency, products, materials, services and technology to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people and products among certain countries may be subjected to these laws and regulations.
Health and Safety Laws
We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations, both in the U.S. and abroad, relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.

Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, human health and safety in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our operations, like those of other radiopharmaceutical companies, involve the transport, use, handling, storage, exposure to and disposal of materials and wastes regulated under environmental laws, including hazardous and radioactive materials and wastes. If we violate these laws and regulations, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We believe that our operations currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Certain environmental laws and regulations assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials or wastes at those formerly owned or operated properties or at third party properties at which they have disposed of hazardous materials or wastes. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury, property damage or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials or wastes. We currently are not party to any claims or any obligations to investigate or remediate any material contamination at any of our facilities, however, if we were found to be liable under one or more of these laws or regulations, it could create a substantial liability.
We are required to maintain a number of environmental permits and nuclear licenses for our North Billerica campus, which includes our primary manufacturing, packaging and distribution facility. In particular, we must maintain a nuclear byproducts materials license issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This license requires that we provide financial assurance demonstrating our ability to cover the cost of decommissioning and decontaminating (“D&D”) the North Billerica site at the end of its use as a nuclear facility. We store low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials are below regulatory limits, as allowed by our licenses and permits. As of December 31, 2024, we estimate the D&D cost of all of our manufacturing sites to be approximately $25.1 million. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have a liability of approximately $23.3 million and $22.9 million, respectively associated with our asset retirement obligations. We currently provide this financial assurance in the form of a surety bond.
We also actively monitor and seek to reduce our solid waste, energy and water usage, waste water discharge and greenhouse gas emissions. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of wastes generated by our operations. In 2020, we developed a stormwater management operations and maintenance plan to minimize stormwater pollution from high impact activities. Improvements we made include (i) the regular inspection and cleaning of catch basins and piping to reduce sediment and debris wash out to adjacent wetlands; (ii) increasing street and parking lot cleaning to reduce pollutant run off; (iii) updating our snow removal plan at our North Billerica campus to reduce the impact to adjacent wetlands; and (iv) using salt brine as a pretreatment for winter storms to reduce the amount of salt use and run off. 
With respect to sustainability, we track and monitor our energy use, water generation and a limited scope of greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2022, we have powered our North Billerica campus with renewable wind energy through a contract with National Grid. 
We use a third-party environmental software to track available environmental data fields and in 2024 expanded our scope to include data for all of our locations. The implementation of this software rapidly improved our efficiency in data collection and reporting. To drive continuous improvement, we compare our usage data against prior annual baselines, national medians, and similar businesses.

Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. While it is not feasible to predict the future costs of ongoing environmental compliance, it is possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs that, in management’s opinion, are not likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, but could be material to the results of operations in any one accounting period.

Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2024, we had 808 employees, of which 783 were located in the U.S. and 25 were located internationally. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Diversity, Inclusion, Ethics and Compliance
We believe that supporting our local community and instilling a diverse, inclusive, ethical and compliant culture makes us an employer of choice, allows us to maintain good standing with the regulatory authorities and our customers, and benefits our stockholders in the long run.
Five of eleven of the directors on our Board, including our Chairperson, are women, and over half of our senior management team, which we refer to as our “Expanded Executive Team,” as well as employees holding the position of Vice President or above are women. Approximately 49% of our employees are women. We continue to strive to improve our diversity and inclusion compliantly with a strategic emphasis beyond gender, and we require recruiters working with us to present a diverse candidate slate for posted positions as we believe that we benefit from having a skilled team with a diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds and experiences. We also sponsor Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that are open to all of our employees, including the Lantheus Diversity Connection ERG, the Women Leaders of Lantheus ERG and the Lantheus Veterans, Employees and Reservists Inspired to Act and Serve ERG.
We are committed to promoting a culture of ethics and compliance. Our Code of Conduct and Ethics reflects our commitment to corporate integrity and the underlying business practices and principles of behavior that support this commitment. Each year our employees complete mandatory training that includes anti-bribery/anti-corruption rules, insider trading prohibitions, confidentiality obligations, as well as specialized training in healthcare industry marketing practices among other things. We have a formal Ethics and Compliance Committee that develops, implements and oversees our ethics and compliance programs. We also have a Supplier Code of Conduct, and we seek to do business with minority-owned, female-owned and other diverse businesses and organizations (including those owned or operated by veterans and disabled veterans) that appropriately reflect the communities in which we operate and the customer base we serve, equip us with a deeper understanding of challenges impacting our communities and customers, and enable us to provide more innovative solutions and better outcomes.
Compensation and Benefits
We seek to provide pay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package includes, among other things, market-competitive pay, cash bonuses, healthcare and defined contribution plan benefits, paid time off and family leave, and, to certain levels of employees, restricted stock and other equity grants. We are focused on pay equity and regularly assess pay among similar roles and responsibilities throughout our organization and in comparison to our peer group. 
Communication and Engagement
We believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to our overall strategy. To this end, we utilize a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including: (i) quarterly town hall meetings for our entire company; (ii) regular ongoing update communications, including through monthly newsletters and our intranet site; and (iii) an externally administered whistleblower hotline and website that is prominently advertised to our employees, and a whistleblower’s anonymity is protected, if so requested. We also established various employee recognition award programs to recognize and reward employees for specific outstanding accomplishments and to foster a positive employee relations climate.

Corporate History
Founded in 1956 as New England Nuclear Corporation, our medical imaging diagnostic business was purchased by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) in 1981. Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) subsequently acquired our diagnostic medical imaging business as part of its acquisition of DuPont Pharmaceuticals in 2001. In January 2008, Avista Capital Partners, L.P., Avista Capital Partners (Offshore), L.P. and ACP-Lantern Co-Invest, LLC formed Lantheus Holdings and acquired our medical imaging business from BMS. On June 30, 2015, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “LNTH”.
