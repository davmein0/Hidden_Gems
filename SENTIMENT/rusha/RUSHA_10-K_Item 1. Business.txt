General

Rush Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated in Texas in 1965 and consists of one reportable segment, the Truck Segment, and conducts business through its subsidiaries. Our principal offices are located at 555 IH 35 South New Braunfels, Texas 78130.

We are a full-service, integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services. The Truck Segment includes our operation of a network of commercial vehicle dealerships under the name “Rush Truck Centers.” Rush Truck Centers primarily sell commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, International, Hino, Ford, Isuzu, IC Bus, Blue Bird, Dennis Eagle, Blue Arc and Battle Motors. Through our strategically located network of Rush Truck Centers, we provide one-stop service for the needs of our commercial vehicle customers, including retail sales of new and used commercial vehicles, aftermarket parts sales, service and repair facilities, financing, leasing and rental, and insurance products.

Our Rush Truck Centers are principally located in high traffic areas throughout the United States and Ontario, Canada. Since commencing operations as a Peterbilt heavy-duty truck dealer in 1966, we have grown to operate over 143 franchised Rush Truck Centers locations in 23 states. In 2019, we purchased a 50% equity interest in an entity in Canada, Rush Truck Centres of Canada Limited (“RTC Canada”) and on May 2, 2022, we purchased an additional 30% equity interest in RTC Canada that increased our equity interest to 80%. RTC Canada currently owns and operates 12 International dealership locations in Ontario. Prior to acquiring the additional 30%, we accounted for the equity interest in RTC Canada using the equity method of accounting. Now, the operating results of RTC Canada are consolidated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheets and commercial vehicle unit sales data as of May 2, 2022.

Our business strategy consists of providing solutions to the commercial vehicle industry through our network of commercial vehicle dealerships. We offer an integrated approach to meeting customer needs by providing service, parts and collision repairs in addition to new and used commercial vehicle sales and leasing, plus financial services, vehicle upfitting, CNG fuel systems through our joint venture with Cummins and vehicle telematics products. We intend to continue to implement our business strategy, reinforce customer loyalty and remain a market leader by continuing to develop our Rush Truck Centers as we expand our product offerings and extend our dealership network through strategic acquisitions of new locations and opening new dealerships in our existing areas of operation to enable us to better serve our customers.

Through certain of our Rush Truck Centers and several stand-alone locations, we operate 54 franchised Rush Truck Leasing locations in 21 states and 5 locations in Ontario. We provide a broad line of product selections for lease or rent, including Class 4 through Class 8 commercial vehicles, heavy-duty cranes and refuse vehicles. Our lease and rental fleets are offered to customers on a daily, monthly or long-term basis. Substantially all of our long-term leases also contain a service provision, whereby we agree to service the vehicle through the life of the lease. In addition to the product selections for lease or rent, Rush Truck Leasing also provides full-service maintenance on customers’ vehicles at several of our customers’ facilities.

Industry

See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry” for a description of our industry and the markets in which we operate.

Our Business Strategy

Operating Strategy.
 Our strategy is to operate an integrated dealership network that provides service solutions to the commercial vehicle industry throughout the United States and Ontario, Canada. Our strategy includes the following key elements:

●

Management by Dealership Units
. At each of our dealerships, we operate one or more of the following departments: new commercial vehicle sales, used commercial vehicle sales, financial services, part sales, service, or a collision center. Our general managers measure and manage the operations of each dealership according to the specific departments operating at that location. We believe that this system enhances the profitability of all aspects of a dealership and increases our overall operating margins. Operating goals for each department at each of our dealerships are established annually and managers are rewarded for performance relative to these goals.

●

One-Stop Centers
. We have developed certain of our commercial vehicle dealerships as “one-stop centers” that offer an integrated approach to meeting customer needs. We provide service, including collision repairs, parts, new and used commercial vehicles sales, leasing and rental, plus financial services including finance and insurance. We believe that this full-service strategy helps to mitigate cyclical economic fluctuations because our parts, service and collision center operations (referred to herein collectively as “Aftermarket Products and Services”) at our dealerships generally tend to be less cyclical than our new and used commercial vehicle sales.

●

Aftermarket Products and Services
. Our aftermarket capabilities include a wide range of services and products such as providing parts, service and collision repairs at certain of our Rush Truck Centers, a fleet of mobile service units, mobile technicians who work in our customers’ facilities, technology solutions, including vehicle telematics support, a proprietary line of parts and accessories, and factory-certified service for assembly services for specialized bodies and equipment. We believe that offering a variety of Aftermarket Products and Services at our dealerships and other locations allows us to meet the expanding needs of our customers. We continually strive to leverage our dealership network to offer more products and services to our customers.

●

Branding Program
. We employ a branding program at our dealerships through distinctive signage and uniform marketing programs to take advantage of our existing name recognition and to communicate the standardized high quality of our products and reliability of our services throughout our dealership network.

Growth Strategy.
 Through our strategic expansion and acquisition initiatives, we have grown to operate a large, multistate/international, full-service network of commercial vehicle dealerships. As described below, we intend to continue to grow our business by expanding our product and service offerings through acquisitions in new geographic areas and by opening new locations to enable us to better serve our customers.

●

Expansion of Product and Service Offerings
. We intend to continue to expand our product lines within our existing locations by adding product categories and service capabilities that are both complementary to our existing product lines and well suited to our operating model. We will continue to take advantage of technological advances that will provide us with the opportunity to offer vehicle owners more aftermarket options and the ability to maximize the performance of vehicles in their fleets using telematics and other technologies.

●

Expansion Into New Geographic Areas
. We plan to continue to expand our dealership network by acquiring existing dealerships or opening new locations in areas where we do not already have locations. We believe the geographic diversity of our Rush Truck Center network has significantly expanded our customer base while reducing the effects of local economic cycles.

Open New Rush Truck Centers in Existing Areas of Operation
. We continually evaluate opportunities to increase our market presence by adding new Rush Truck Centers within our current franchises’ areas of operation.

Management of Our Dealerships

Rush Truck Centers

Our Rush Truck Centers are responsible for sales of new and used commercial vehicles, as well as related Aftermarket Products and Services.

Aftermarket Products and Services
. Revenues from Aftermarket Products and Services accounted for approximately $2,516.0 million, or 32.2%, of our total revenues for 2024, and 60.4% of our gross profit. Rush Truck Centers carry a wide variety of commercial vehicle parts in inventory. Certain Rush Truck Centers also feature fully equipped service and collision center facilities, the combination and configuration of which varies by location, capable of handling a broad range of repairs on most commercial vehicles. Each Rush Truck Center with a service department is a warranty service center for the commercial vehicle manufacturers represented at that location, if any, and most are also authorized service centers for other vehicle component manufacturers, including Cummins, Eaton, Caterpillar and Allison. We also have mobile service technicians and technicians who staff our customers’ facilities upon request.

Our service departments perform warranty and non-warranty repairs on commercial vehicles. The cost of warranty work is generally reimbursed by the applicable manufacturer at retail commercial rates. Warranty-related parts and service revenues accounted for approximately $186.6 million, or 2.4%, of our total revenues for 2024. Additionally, we provide a wide array of services, including assembly services for specialized commercial vehicle bodies and commercial vehicle mounted equipment. Our goal is to provide our customers with any service that they need related to their commercial vehicles.

We also enter into contracts to provide full-service maintenance on certain customers’ vehicles. We had 2,942 vehicles under contract maintenance as of December 31, 2024. The full-service maintenance revenues and retail service revenues are included as Aftermarket Products and Services revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

New Commercial Vehicle Sales
. New commercial vehicle sales represent the largest portion of our revenues, accounting for approximately $4,553.0 million, or 58.3%, of our total revenues in 2024. Of this total, new Class 8 heavy-duty truck sales accounted for approximately $2,906.8 million, or 37.2%, of our total revenues for 2024, and 63.8% of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2024.

Our Rush Truck Centers that sell new and used Class 8 heavy-duty trucks manufactured by Peterbilt, International, Hino, Dennis Eagle or Battle Motors may also sell medium-duty and light-duty commercial vehicles. Certain Rush Truck Centers sell medium-duty commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, Hino, Isuzu, Ford, International, Blue Arc, Dennis Eagle or Battle Motors, buses manufactured by Blue Bird, IC Bus or Micro Bird and light-duty commercial vehicles manufactured by Ford. New medium-duty commercial vehicle sales, excluding new bus sales, accounted for approximately $1,312.3 million, or 16.8%, of our total revenues for 2024, and 28.8% of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2024. New bus sales accounted for approximately $172.9 million, or 2.2%, of our total revenues for 2024, and 3.8% of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2024. New light-duty commercial vehicle sales accounted for approximately $126.0 million, or 1.6%, of our total revenues for 2024, and 2.8% of our new commercial vehicle revenues for 2024.

A significant portion of our new commercial vehicle sales are to customers with large fleets of commercial vehicles. Because of the size and geographic scope of our Rush Truck Center network, our strong relationships with our fleet customers and our ability to manage large quantities of used commercial vehicle trade-ins, we are able to successfully market and sell to fleet customers nationwide. We believe that we have a competitive advantage over many dealerships because we can absorb multi-unit trade-ins often associated with fleet sales and effectively disperse the used commercial vehicles for resale throughout our dealership network. We believe that the broad range of products and services we offer to purchasers of commercial vehicles at the time of purchase and post-purchase results in a high level of customer loyalty.

Table of Contents

Used Commercial Vehicle Sales
. Used commercial vehicle sales accounted for approximately $335.8 million, or 4.3%, of our total revenues for 2024. We sell used commercial vehicles at most of our Rush Truck Centers and at our non-franchised used commercial vehicle facilities. We believe that we are well positioned to market used commercial vehicles due to our ability to recondition them for resale utilizing the service and collision center departments of our Rush Truck Centers and our ability to move used commercial vehicles between our dealerships as customer demand warrants. Most of our used commercial vehicle inventory consists of commercial vehicles taken as trade-ins from new commercial vehicle customers or retired from our lease and rental fleet, but we also supplement our used commercial vehicle inventory by purchasing used commercial vehicles from third parties for resale, as market conditions warrant.

Vehicle Leasing and Rental
. Vehicle leasing and rental revenues accounted for approximately $354.9 million, or 4.5%, of our total revenues for 2024. At our Rush Truck Leasing locations, we engage in full-service commercial vehicle leasing and rental through our PacLease and Idealease franchises. As of December 31, 2024, we had 10,148 commercial vehicles in our lease and rental fleet. Generally, we sell commercial vehicles that have been retired from our lease and rental fleet through our used commercial vehicles sales operations. Historically, we have realized gains on the sale of used lease and rental fleet inventory.

New and Used Commercial Vehicle Financing and Insurance
. The sale of financial and insurance products accounted for approximately $22.0 million, or 0.3%, of our total revenues for 2024. Finance and insurance revenues have minimal direct costs and therefore, contribute a disproportionate share to our operating profits.

Many of our Rush Truck Centers have personnel responsible for arranging third-party financing for our product offerings. Generally, commercial vehicle finance contracts involve an installment contract, which is secured by the commercial vehicle financed and requires a down payment, with the remaining balance generally financed over a two-year to seven-year period. Most of these finance contracts are sold to third parties without recourse to us. We provide an allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties that we may incur under these finance contracts.

We sell, as an agent, a complete line of property and casualty insurance to commercial vehicle owners. Our agency, which operates at locations around the United States outside of our Rush Truck Centers, is licensed to sell commercial vehicle liability, collision and comprehensive, workers’ compensation, cargo, and credit life insurance coverage offered by several leading insurance companies.

Human Capital Management

On December 31, 2024, we employed 7,388 people in the U.S. and 550 people in Canada. Of these employees, less than 1.4% of our workforce was classified as part-time. We do not regularly use independent contractors in our business operations. We strive to provide our employees with the security of long-term employment, competitive compensation and benefits, a consistent work schedule and opportunities to improve their skills and advance within the Company.

Core Values. 
Our core values define our culture and reflect who we are and the way we interact with our customers, suppliers, co-workers and shareholders. Our core values are productivity, fairness, excellence and a positive attitude and are described below.

●

Productivity means constantly striving toward efficiency and success in all interactions and activities while working with a common purpose and sense of urgency.

●

Fairness characterizes our honesty, integrity, truthfulness, dependability and reliability in everything we do.

●

Excellence means doing it better than everyone else does. Our excellence is reflected in our first-class facilities, quality products and services, motivated and talented employees, superior results for the customer and consistency throughout our organization.

●

Positive attitude means approaching every day with excitement and passion for our work and dedication to our customers with positive intensity.

Each of these core values is embodied in our code of conduct, which we call our Rush Driving Principles. Employees are required to complete training on the Rush Driving Principles and certify that they have read and understand such principles on an annual basis. We believe that our core values are the foundation of a strong and ethical culture that is a strength for us, and we intend to continue building upon that culture to improve performance across our business.

Employee Recruitment. 
We strive to attract the best talent from a variety of sources to meet the current and future needs of our business. We have established relationships with multiple trade schools and universities across the country that we utilize as a source for entry-level talent. Additionally, we believe it is incumbent upon all our managers to continuously monitor their local markets for experienced individuals who might be successful additions to our organization.

Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits. 
Our compensation programs are designed to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward employees who must operate in a highly competitive, fast-paced environment. In general, our compensation programs consist of a base salary or hourly rate, commissions for employees in front-line customer facing roles, cash performance bonuses for certain employees, equity incentive awards for senior leaders, vacation leave, sick leave and other forms of paid time off.

We offer a defined contribution retirement savings plan (the “Rush 401k Plan”) to eligible employees. Under the Rush 401k Plan, participants may contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax or post-tax (Roth) basis.  We provide a matching contribution that is based on the participant’s contribution and years of service.  Contributions to the plan are invested in various investment options selected by the participants, including mutual funds, target-date funds, and other investment vehicles.

We are committed to fair pay and have established a minimum hourly wage of $15.00 per hour. Our employees receive a base level of monthly or hourly compensation that we believe is commensurate with their expertise, skills, knowledge, experience and location. We are an equal opportunity employer and employment and advancement within the Company is based solely upon individual merit and qualifications directly related to the job. To guard against unintentional discriminatory effects and to promote transparency and equality of opportunity, we regularly conduct analyses of pay to identify any adverse impacts to any legally protected group.

We provide our full-time employees with comprehensive benefit options that allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of the wide-ranging benefits we offer include medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, smoking cessation assistance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts.

We also provide our employees with an opportunity to participate in the ownership of the Company by offering an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their base earnings every six months toward the semi-annual purchase of the Company’s Class A common stock. Employees participating in the stock purchase plan receive a 15% discount on the purchase price of the stock, with such discount based on lesser of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the first business day or the last business day of the semi-annual offering period. In addition, we provide our employees with an opportunity to save for retirement by participating in the Rush 401k plan, which has a Company-matching component that is based on years of service.

Talent Development
. Our talent development programs supply our employees and leaders with tools and experiences to foster learning, employee engagement, leadership development, talent management, and employee development. Career development is fostered through education, training, learning opportunities, succession planning and performance management. Programs are designed to facilitate the development and advancement of talent from within our organization to enable us to continuously fill our ranks with qualified employees for critical positions in the organization.

Our Rush Foundational Leader Program is focused on developing key management and leadership skills. The Rush Foundational Leader Program consists of a series of courses ranging from basic management skills, including promoting a culture of inclusion, to more advanced leadership concepts and skills that are designed for managers throughout our organization. As a continuation of our leadership development initiatives, we have implemented our High Impact Leadership series, which focuses on building more advanced leadership skills such as motivating employees through meaningful feedback and inclusive leadership and communication.

To support career growth and organizational succession planning, we utilize Fuel50, a performance management and career pathing tool designed to help leaders facilitate performance and development conversations while giving employees a tool to discover and communicate their career aspirations. In addition, we have established a program called Growing Resilient Outstanding Women (“GROW”), which is open to all employees and focuses on enabling women to continue their professional development through educational opportunities, mentoring and networking. We also have a New Graduate Program that identifies and recruits new talent from universities across the country and provides on-the-job training for them to fill various roles within our dealership network.

Table of Contents

To enhance and develop the technical skills of entry-level service and body shop technicians, we established a formal mentorship program led by experienced service and body shop technicians who serve as mentors to newly hired, entry level service and body shop technicians. We believe that this program increases the technicians’ likelihood of career success. This formal mentorship program also helps us identify top performers and we believe it improves employee performance and retention for participants in the program.

Employee Experience. 
We conduct an annual comprehensive employee engagement survey designed to measure organizational culture and engagement. The purpose of the survey is to monitor overall employee engagement with the goal of identifying actions that can be taken to continuously improve our employee engagement, which we believe leads to increased employee retention. Data collected in each annual employee engagement survey is maintained and used to track our progress against our internal goals. Additionally, we use onboarding and exit survey feedback to monitor and improve engagement and retention. We have formal listening groups that provide additional engagement channels for feedback from our dealerships to senior management throughout the year. One of these groups is the Field Leadership Advisory Group (“FLAG”). FLAG consists of field employees nominated and selected for their valuable experience. They provide regular feedback to executives to ensure that issues they are facing are handled in an efficient and consistent manner and with the customer in mind. 

Another aspect of the employee experience is our reward and recognition program, called STAR. Managers and employees may nominate a colleague for superior work, outstanding effort, and demonstration of our company’s core values.

Management continually monitors employee turnover data, which is supplemented with additional data from exit surveys to assist in determining the reasons for voluntary employee terminations. In 2024, our overall turnover rate for U.S. and Canada was 30.5%, as compared to 25.1% in 2023, due in large part to expense reduction efforts completed in the first half of 2024. The turnover rate of our technicians is monitored closely by management, as the retention of skilled technicians is critical to the success of the Company. Demand for technicians across the country is very high, and turnover in this role is also traditionally high for commercial vehicle dealers. In 2024, our turnover rate for U.S. and Canada technicians was 38.1%, compared to 33.6% in 2023.  

Recognizing the industry-wide challenge of technician turnover, we are implementing a comprehensive strategy to retain and engage this critical segment of our workforce. Our strategy includes identifying key predictors of turnover, conducting technician “stay” interviews to proactively address concerns and improve job satisfaction, employing pay calculator tools to ensure our employees have a clear understanding of their total compensation package and opportunities and that managers are actively advancing technician careers.

Ethics and Compliance. 
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate conduct and fostering a culture of integrity and accountability throughout our organization. Our ethics and compliance program is structured to ensure adherence to applicable laws, regulations and industry standards, as well as to uphold our core values and the principles outlined in the Rush Driving Principles.

A cornerstone of our program is the ongoing training and education of our employees on key ethics and compliance topics, equipping them to make informed decisions and uphold the standards expected of our organization. We further reinforce this commitment through regular communications that emphasize the importance of ethics and integrity in all aspects of our operations.

To ensure that concerns can be raised and questions addressed without fear of retaliation, we provide an anonymous ethics helpline. This helpline enables employees and stakeholders to confidentially report potential ethics violations or misconduct and seek guidance on ethics and compliance-related matters.

Health and Safety. 
Promoting a safe and healthy workplace is our highest priority and is embodied in our core values. We utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of our operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") and the Lost Time (or Lost Workday) Incident Rate ("LTIR") based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours). Leading indicators include training completion rates, tracking of local safety committee meeting minutes, and recording of near misses, as well as other proactive actions taken to ensure employee safety. In 2024, we had a TRIR of 4.10, compared to 3.68 in 2023 and a LTIR of 0.62 in 2024, compared to 0.57 in 2023.

Labor Relations. 
We have entered into collective bargaining agreements covering certain employees at our Rush Truck Center, Chicago location, which will expire on May 10, 2025, Joliet, Illinois, which will expire on May 3, 2026, Carol Stream, Illinois, which will expire on May 2, 2027 and at our Chicago Light and Medium Duty location, which will expire on May 6, 2028. There have been no strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns during the negotiations of the foregoing collective bargaining agreements or at any time in the Company’s history, although no assurances can be given that such actions will not occur. We believe that our relations with the labor unions that represent these employees are generally good.

Sales and Marketing

Our established history of operations in the commercial vehicle business has resulted in a strong customer base that is diverse in terms of geography, industry and scale of operations. Our customers include national and regional truck fleets, corporations, local and state governments and owner-operators. During 2024, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales by dollar volume. We generally promote our products and related services through direct customer contact by our sales personnel and advertising.

Facility Management

Personnel.
 Each of our facilities is typically managed by a general manager who oversees the operations, personnel and the financial performance of the location, subject to the direction of a regional manager and personnel at our corporate headquarters. Additionally, each full-service Rush Truck Center is typically staffed by department managers, sales representatives and other employees, as appropriate, given the services offered. The sales staff of each Rush Truck Center is compensated on a salary plus commission, or a commission only basis, while department managers receive a combination of salary and performance bonus. We believe that our employees are among the highest paid in the industry, which enables us to attract and retain qualified personnel.

Compliance with Policies and Procedures.
 Each Rush Truck Center is audited regularly for compliance with corporate policies and procedures. These internal audits objectively measure dealership performance with respect to corporate expectations in the management and administration of sales, commercial vehicle inventory, parts inventory, parts sales, service sales, collision center sales, corporate policy compliance and environmental and safety compliance matters.

Purchasing and Suppliers.
 Because of our size and the corresponding cost savings we provide, we benefit from volume purchases at favorable prices that permit us to achieve a competitive pricing position in the industry. We purchase our commercial vehicle inventory and proprietary parts and accessories directly from the applicable vehicle manufacturer, wholesale distributors, or other sources that provide the most favorable pricing. Most purchasing commitments are negotiated by personnel at our corporate headquarters. Historically, we have been able to negotiate favorable pricing levels and terms, which enable us to offer competitive prices for our products.

Commercial Vehicle Inventory Management.
 We utilize our management information systems to monitor the inventory level of commercial vehicles at each of our dealerships and transfer new and used commercial vehicle inventory among Rush Truck Centers as needed.

Parts Distribution and Inventory Management.
 We utilize a parts inventory distribution and management system that allows for the prompt transfer of parts inventory among various Rush Truck Centers. The transfer of inventory reduces delays in delivery, helps maximize inventory turns and assists in reducing overstock and understock. Our network is linked to our major suppliers for purposes of ordering parts and managing parts inventory levels. Automated reordering and communication systems allow us to maintain proper parts inventory levels and permit us to have parts inventory delivered to our locations, or directly to customers, typically within 24 hours of an order being placed.

Recent Acquisitions

On July 15, 2024, we acquired certain assets of Nebraska Peterbilt, which included real estate and a Peterbilt commercial vehicle franchise in Grand Island and North Platte, Nebraska, along with commercial vehicle and parts inventory. The transaction was valued at approximately $16.5 million, with the purchase price paid in cash.

On December 4, 2023, we acquired certain assets of Freeway Ford Truck Sales, Inc., which included real estate and a Ford commercial vehicle franchise in Chicago, Illinois, along with commercial vehicle and parts inventory. The transaction was valued at approximately $16.3 million, with the purchase price paid in cash.

On November 7, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of Scheppers International Truck Center, Inc., which included real estate and an International truck franchise in Jefferson City, Missouri, along with commercial vehicle and parts inventory. The transaction was valued at approximately $6.8 million, with the purchase price paid in cash.

On May 2, 2022, we acquired an additional 30% equity interest in RTC Canada for approximately $20.0 million, bringing our equity interest to 80%. Prior to acquiring our additional equity interest, we accounted for the equity interest in RTC Canada using the equity method of accounting. After we acquired the additional 30% equity interest, the operating results of RTC Canada were consolidated in the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See Note 15 – Acquisitions in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further discussion.

Competition

There is, and will continue to be, significant competition both within our current markets and in new markets we may enter. We anticipate that competition between us and other dealership groups will continue to increase in our current markets and on a national level based on the following:

●

the ability to keep customers’ vehicles operational, which is dependent on the accessibility of dealership locations and the ability to attract and retain service technicians;

●

the number of dealership locations representing the manufacturers that we represent and other manufacturers, which impacts manufacturers’ ability to provide more consistent, higher quality service in a timely manner across their dealership networks;

●

price, value, quality and design of the products sold; and

●

our attention to customer service (including technical service).

Our dealerships compete with dealerships representing other manufacturers, including commercial vehicles manufactured by Mack, Freightliner, Kenworth and Volvo. We believe that our dealerships are able to compete with other franchised dealerships, independent service centers, parts wholesalers, commercial vehicle wholesalers, rental service companies and industrial auctioneers in distributing our products and providing service because of the following: the overall quality and reputation of the products we sell; the “Rush” brand name recognition and reputation for quality service; the geographic scope of our dealership network; the breadth of commercial vehicles offered in our dealership network; and our ability to provide comprehensive Aftermarket Products and Services, as well as financing, insurance and other customer services.

Dealership Franchise Agreements

Peterbilt.
 We have entered into nonexclusive dealership franchise agreements with Peterbilt that authorize us to act as a dealer of Peterbilt heavy- and medium-duty trucks. Our Peterbilt areas of responsibility currently encompass areas in the states of Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. These agreements currently have terms expiring in July 2025. Our agreements with Peterbilt may be terminated by Peterbilt in the event that the aggregate voting power of W.M. “Rusty” Rush, and certain current and former executives of the Company decreases below 22%. Sales of new Peterbilt commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 34.3% of our total revenues for 2024.

International.
 We have entered into nonexclusive dealership franchise agreements with International that authorize us to act as a dealer of International heavy- and medium-duty trucks and, in certain markets, IC buses. Our International areas of responsibility currently encompass areas in the states of Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Ontario, Canada. These agreements currently have terms expiring between May 2025 and January 2029. Sales of new International commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 17.4% of our total revenues for 2024.

Other Commercial Vehicle Suppliers
. In addition to our dealership franchise agreements with Peterbilt and International, various Rush Truck Centers have entered into dealership franchise agreements with other commercial vehicle manufacturers, including Ford, Hino, Isuzu and Battle Motors that have perpetual terms and Blue Bird, Micro Bird, Dennis Eagle and Blue Arc that have variable terms. Sales of new non Peterbilt and non-International commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 6.6% of our total revenues for 2024.

Our dealership franchise agreements impose certain operational obligations and financial requirements upon us and the relevant dealerships. In addition, each of our dealership franchise agreements requires the consent of the relevant manufacturer for the sale or transfer of a franchise.

Any termination or nonrenewal of our dealership agreements must follow certain guidelines established by both state and federal legislation designed to protect motor vehicle dealers from arbitrary termination or nonrenewal of franchise agreements. The federal Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act and certain other similar state laws generally provide that the termination or nonrenewal of a motor vehicle dealership agreement must be done in “good faith” and upon a showing of “good cause” by the manufacturer for such termination or nonrenewal, as such terms have been defined by statute and interpreted in case law.

Floor Plan Financing

Most of our commercial vehicle purchases are made on terms requiring payment to the manufacturer within 15 to 60 days or less from the date the commercial vehicles are invoiced from the factory. Navistar Financial Corporation and Peterbilt offer trade terms that provide an interest-free inventory stocking period for certain new commercial vehicles. This interest-free period is 15 to 60 days. If the commercial vehicle is not sold within the interest-free period, we finance the commercial vehicle under one of our floor plan credit agreements.

On December 16, 2024, we entered into a new Inventory Financing and Purchase Money Security Agreement (the “PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement”) with Paccar Financial Corp. (“PFC”). The PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement includes an aggregate loan commitment of $800.0 million for the financing of new Peterbilt trucks, tractors, chassis and other related equipment manufactured by Peterbilt. Borrowings under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the fifth day of the following month, at our option, at either (A) the prime rate, minus 2.10%, provided that the floating rate of interest is subject to a floor of 0%, or (B) a fixed rate, to be determined between Rush and PFC in each instance of borrowing at a fixed rate. The PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires December 16, 2029, although either party has the right to terminate the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement at any time upon 360 days written notice. On December 31, 2024, we had approximately $492.7 million outstanding under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement. We utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our gross interest expense under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

On September 14, 2021, we entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with BMO Bank N.A. (f/ka/ BMO Harris Bank N.A.) and the lenders signatory thereto. This agreement had an aggregate loan commitment of $1.0 billion, which we utilized to finance all of our new and used commercial vehicle inventory in the United States until we entered into the Peterbilt Floor Plan Agreement. On December 12, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with BMO Bank N.A. and the lenders signatory thereto. The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and all amendments thereto are referred to herein as the “BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement.” Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, the aggregate loan commitment was reduced from $1.0 billion to $675.0 million and the definition of “Inventory” was amended to remove trucks, tractors and chassis manufactured by Peterbilt. We utilize the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement to finance all of our new commercial vehicle inventory, except for equipment manufactured by Peterbilt, and all of our used commercial vehicle inventory and for working capital purposes. Borrowings under the BMO Floor Plan Agreement bear interest per annum, payable monthly, at (A) the greater of (i) zero and (ii) Term SOFR (as defined in the agreement), plus (B) 1.20%. Borrowings under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement for the purchase of used inventory are limited to $150.0 million and loans for working capital purposes are limited to $200.0 million. The BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires December 31, 2029, although BMO Bank N.A. has the right to terminate at any time upon 360 days written notice and we may terminate at any time, subject to specified limited exceptions. On December 31, 2024, we had approximately $389.3 million outstanding under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement. The average daily outstanding borrowin.gs under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement were $956.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. We utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our gross interest expense under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

Lease and Rental Fleet Financing

On September 14, 2021, we entered into the Credit Agreement (the “WF Credit Agreement”) with the lenders signatory thereto (the “WF Lenders”) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“WF”), as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the “WF Agent”). Pursuant to the terms of the WF Credit Agreement (as amended), the WF Lenders have agreed to make up to $175.0 million of revolving credit loans for certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for our Idealease leasing and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. We expect to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for our Idealease lease and rental fleet. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the WF Credit Agreement from time to time until the maturity date. Borrowings under the WF Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on each interest payment date, at (A) the daily SOFR plus (i) 1.25% or (ii) 1.5%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or (B) on or after the SOFR transition date, SOFR plus (i) 1.25% or (ii) 1.5%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The WF Credit Agreement expires on September 14, 2026, although, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the WF Agent has the right to, or upon the request of the required lenders must, terminate the commitments and declare all outstanding principal and interest due and payable. We may terminate the commitments at any time. On December 31, 2024, we had approximately $153.4 million outstanding under the WF Credit Agreement.

On November 1, 2023, the Company entered into that certain Second Amended and Restated Inventory Financing and Purchase Money Security Agreement with PACCAR Leasing Company (“PLC”), a division of PFC (the “PLC Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the PLC Agreement (as amended), PLC agreed to make up to $500.0 million of revolving credit loans to finance certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through our PacLease franchises.

Product Warranties

The manufacturers we represent provide retail purchasers of their products with a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, excluding certain specified components that are separately warranted by the suppliers of such components. We provide a limited warranty on our proprietary line of parts and related service. Our joint venture entity, Cummins Clean Fuel Technologies, provides a limited warranty with respect to the fuel systems it manufactures. We also provide an extended warranty beyond the manufacturer’s warranty on new Blue Bird school buses that we sell in Texas, as required by state law.

We sell used commercial vehicles in “as is” condition without a manufacturer’s warranty, although manufacturers sometimes will provide a limited warranty on their used products if such products have been properly reconditioned prior to resale or if the manufacturer’s warranty on such product is transferable and has not expired. Although we do not provide any warranty on used commercial vehicles, our customers may purchase third-party warranties from us.

Trademarks

The trademarks and trade names of the manufacturers we represent, which are used in connection with our marketing and sales efforts, are subject to limited licenses included in our dealership agreements with each manufacturer. The licenses are for the same periods as our dealership agreements. These trademarks and trade names are widely recognized and are important in the marketing of our products. Each licensor engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection. We hold registered trademarks from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the following names used in this document: “Rush Enterprises” and “Rush Truck Center.”

Seasonality

Our Truck Segment is moderately seasonal. Seasonal effects on new commercial vehicle sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the diverse geographic locations of our dealerships and our diverse customer base, including regional and national fleets, local and state governments, corporations and owner-operators. However, Aftermarket Products and Services operations historically have experienced higher sales volumes in the second and third quarters.

Backlog

On December 31, 2024, our backlog of commercial vehicle orders was approximately $1,512.7 million, compared to a backlog of commercial vehicle orders of approximately $3,733.4 million on December 31, 2023. The decrease in our backlog primarily reflects the decreased demand for new Class 8 trucks resulting from production having caught up to pent-up demand and the ongoing freight recession. Our backlog is determined quarterly by multiplying the number of new commercial vehicles for each type of commercial vehicle ordered by a customer at our Rush Truck Centers by the recent average selling price for that type of commercial vehicle. We include only confirmed orders in our backlog. However, such orders are subject to cancellation. In the event of order cancellation, we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The delivery time for a custom-ordered commercial vehicle varies depending on the truck specifications and demand for the model ordered. We sell the majority of our new heavy-duty commercial vehicles by customer special order and we sell the majority of our medium and light-duty commercial vehicles out of inventory. Orders from a number of our major fleet customers are included in our backlog as of December 31, 2024, and we expect to fill all our backlog orders during 2025. Given the current uncertainty in connection with recently announced tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, we believe that certain commercial vehicle orders currently reflected in our backlog could be cancelled in the event that such tariffs are enacted and significantly increase the aggregate price that our customers will have to pay for such vehicles.

Environmental Standards and Other Governmental Regulations

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the following: discharges into the air and water; the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks; the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, petroleum and other materials; and the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts. As with commercial vehicle dealerships generally, and vehicle service, parts and collision center operations in particular, our business involves the generation, use, storage, handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous materials or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.

12

Table of Contents

Our operations involving the use, handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous materials are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Pursuant to these laws, federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of regulated substances with which we must comply. Our business also involves the operation and use of aboveground and underground storage tanks. These storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal under RCRA and comparable state statutes. Furthermore, investigation or remediation may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from current or former underground or aboveground storage tanks.

We may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third‑party recycling, treatment, or disposal facilities under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state statutes. These statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of environmental impacts without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the impacts. Responsible parties under these statutes may include the owner or operator of the site where impacts occurred and companies that disposed, or arranged for the disposal, of the hazardous substances released at these sites. These responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other materials into the environment.

The federal Clean Water Act and comparable state statutes require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans. Water quality protection programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations. Similarly, the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state statutes regulate emissions of various air emissions through permitting programs and the imposition of standards and other requirements.

We do not believe that we currently have any material environmental liabilities or that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, soil and groundwater impacts are known to exist at some of our dealerships. Further, environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. In addition, in connection with acquisitions, it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities, some of which may be material. In connection with our dispositions, or prior dispositions made by companies we acquire, we may retain exposure for environmental costs and liabilities, some of which may be material. Compliance with current or amended, or new or more stringent, laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition, such laws could affect demand for the products that we sell.

We are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the commercial vehicle engine emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation, have issued rules associated with reducing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) and Nitrogen Oxide (“NOx”) emissions and improving the fuel efficiency of medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses. One of these rules, referred to herein as the “EPA 2027 Low NOx” rule, will require commercial vehicle engines to emit significantly less NOx than such engines do today, beginning in model year 2027. The EPA 2027 Low NOx rule also would increase the useful life of each vehicle and would require that manufacturers extend the warranty term of each vehicle to ensure that commercial vehicles remain compliant with the EPA’s emission standards as such vehicles age. In March 2024, the EPA issued an additional rule associated with reducing GHG emissions from heavy-duty trucks and buses for model years 2027 through 2032 (the “GHG-3” rule). While the GHG-3 rule claims to be technology neutral, in order to comply with the rule, commercial vehicle engine manufacturers would be required to manufacture an increasing percentage of “zero-emission” vehicles over time, which would likely reduce the number of diesel internal combustion engines (“ICE”) vehicles that could be manufactured over that time period. Similarly, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) has adopted rules and regulations that are intended to reduce NOx emissions (the “HD Omnibus” rule), phase out the sale of ICE commercial vehicles over time by requiring a certain percentage of each manufacturer’s commercial vehicles sold within the state to be “zero-emission vehicles” (the “Advanced Clean Trucks” rule) and require fleets to purchase a certain number of “zero-emission vehicles” (the “Advanced Clean Fleet” rule). The EPA granted waivers to CARB with respect to the HD Omnibus and Advanced Clean Truck rules, each of which became effective in January 2024. Recently, CARB revoked its request for a waiver from the EPA with respect to the Advanced Clean Fleet rule, and thus, it is unlikely that this rule will become effective in the near future. In addition, the EPA recently announced that it has asked Congress to review the previously granted waivers that CARB received with respect to the HD Omnibus and Advanced Clean Truck rules. The current head of the EPA believes that these waivers should have been approved by Congress prior to becoming effective. With respect to the EPA’s engine emission rules, while it is widely expected that that the current GHG-3 rule will be revoked or modified by a branch of the federal government, it is less clear whether a branch of the federal government may attempt to revoke or modify the EPA 2027 Low NOx rule. It is also worth noting that there are currently multiple lawsuits pending where plaintiffs are challenging CARB’s rules on the basis that, amongst other things, such rules are preempted by other federal laws and that the EPA exceeded its authority in granting the waivers with respect to the HD Omnibus and Advanced Clean Truck rules. There are also multiple lawsuits pending where plaintiffs are challenging the GHG-3 rule on multiple grounds, including that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority in creating the rule.

In July 2023, CARB and various manufacturers of heavy-duty commercial vehicles and engines, including PACCAR, International, Ford, Hino, Isuzu and Cummins, entered into the Clean Truck Partnership, whereby the manufacturers agreed to comply with CARB’s emission requirements where applicable, regardless of whether any entity challenges CARB’s rule-making authority, and CARB agreed to work with manufacturers to provide reasonable lead time to meet CARB’s requirements and before imposing new regulations. In addition, CARB agreed to align its HD Omnibus rule with the EPA 2027 Low NOx rule, which goes into effect starting in model year 2027, and modify certain provisions of its HD Omnibus rule currently in effect. A group of seventeen U.S. states and the District of Columbia have entered into a joint memorandum of understanding that adopts at least a portion of CARB’s emissions regulations and commits each of them to work together to advance and accelerate the market for electric Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles. Six of the states are states where we operate new commercial vehicle dealerships: California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Virginia. The signatories to the memorandum all agreed on a goal of ensuring that 100% of new Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles are zero emission by 2050, with an interim target of 30% zero emission vehicles by 2030, although multiple of these states have recently announced plans to delay various aspects of CARB’s regulations. Attaining these goals would likely require the adoption of new laws and regulations and we cannot predict at this time whether such laws and regulations would have an adverse impact on our business. Additional regulations, or CARB’s enforcement of its existing regulations, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions, or changes in demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
