Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the ordinary course of business. We maintain liability insurance, including product liability coverage, in amounts deemed adequate by management. However, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or claim for which indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2024, we believe that there are no pending claims or litigation, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred.

 under the symbols RUSHA and RUSHB. During 2024, our Board approved four quarterly cash dividends on all outstanding shares of common stock totaling $0.70 per share. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, there is no assurance as to the payment of future dividends because the declaration and payment of such dividends is subject to the business judgment of our Board and will depend on historic and projected earnings, capital requirements, covenant compliance, financial conditions and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.

s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

We are a full-service, integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services. We operate one segment - the Truck Segment. The Truck Segment operates a network of commercial vehicle dealerships primarily under the name “Rush Truck Centers.” Most Rush Truck Centers are a franchised dealer for commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, International, Hino, Ford, Isuzu, Dennis Eagle, Blue Arc, Battle Motors, IC Bus or Blue Bird. Through our strategically located network of Rush Truck Centers, we provide one-stop service for the needs of our commercial vehicle customers. We offer an integrated approach to meeting customer needs by providing service, parts and collision repair (collectively, “Aftermarket Products and Services”) in addition to new and used commercial vehicle sales, leasing, insurance and financial services, vehicle upfitting, CNG fuel systems through our joint venture with Cummins and vehicle telematics products.

Our goal is to continue to serve as the premier service solutions provider to the end-users of commercial vehicles. Our strategic efforts to achieve this goal include continuously expanding our portfolio of Aftermarket Products and Services, broadening the diversity of our commercial vehicle product offerings and extending our network of Rush Truck Centers. Our commitment to provide innovative solutions to service our customers’ needs continues to drive our strong Aftermarket Products and Services revenues.

Our Aftermarket Products and Services include a wide range of capabilities and products such as providing parts, service and collision repairs at certain of our Rush Truck Centers, a fleet of mobile service units, technicians who work in our customers’ facilities, a proprietary line of commercial vehicle parts and accessories, vehicle upfitting, a broad range of diagnostic and analysis capabilities, a suite of telematics products and assembly services for specialized bodies and equipment. Aftermarket Products and Services accounted for 60.4% of our total gross profits in 2024.

Stock Split

On July 25, 2023, the Board declared a 3-for-2 stock split of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock, which was effected in the form of a stock dividend. On August 28, 2023, the Company distributed one additional share of stock for every two shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2023. All share and per share data in this Form 10-K have been adjusted and restated to reflect the stock split as if it occurred on the first day of the earliest period presented.

2025 Outlook

According to A.C.T. Research Co., LLC (“A.C.T. Research”), a commercial vehicle industry data and forecasting service provider, new U. S. Class 8 truck retail sales are estimated to total 252,000 truck units in 2025, a 1.9% increase compared to 247,337 units sold in 2024. We expect our U.S. market share of new Class 8 truck sales to range between 5.8% and 6.3% in 2025. This market share percentage would result in the sale of 14,500 to 16,000 new Class 8 trucks in 2025. We expect to sell approximately 500 additional new Class 8 trucks in Canada in 2025.

According to A.C.T. Research, new U. S. Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle retail sales are estimated to total 266,300 units in 2025, a 5.7% increase compared to 251,895 units sold in 2024. We expect our U.S. market share of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales to range between 5.4% and 5.8% in 2025. This market share percentage would result in the sale of 14,500 to 15,500 new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles in 2025. We expect to sell approximately 550 additional new Class 5 through 7 commercial vehicles in Canada in 2025.

We expect to sell approximately 2,200 to 2,700 light-duty vehicles and 7,000 to 8,000 used commercial vehicles in 2025.

We expect lease and rental revenue to increase approximately 6.0% during 2025, compared to 2024.

In 2025, we expect demand for Aftermarket Products and Services to remain relatively weak through the first few months of 2025 due to the slower than expected freight recovery and continued low fleet utilization from our over-the-road customers. However, we are optimistic that demand will pick up as the year progresses, and we believe that our continued focus on growing our national account customer base and our focus on other aftermarket strategic initiatives will result in aftermarket revenue growth this year.

Key Performance Indicator

Absorption Ratio. 
Management uses several performance metrics to evaluate the performance of our commercial vehicle dealerships and considers Rush Truck Centers’ “absorption ratio” to be of critical importance. Absorption ratio is calculated by dividing the gross profit from our Aftermarket Products and Services departments by the overhead expenses of all of a dealership’s departments, except for the selling expenses of the new and used commercial vehicle departments and carrying costs of new and used commercial vehicle inventory. When 100% absorption is achieved, all of the gross profit from the sale of a commercial vehicle, after sales commissions and inventory carrying costs, directly impacts operating profit. Our commercial vehicle dealerships achieved a 132.2% absorption ratio for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 135.3% absorption ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

28

Table of Contents

The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventory Reserves

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by specific identification of new and used commercial vehicle inventory. An allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value.

Purchase Price Allocation, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Purchase price allocation for business combinations and asset acquisitions requires the use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. We determine whether substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is not a business. If not, we determine whether the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, meets the definition of a business.

In connection with our business combinations, we record certain intangible assets, including franchise rights. We periodically review the estimated useful lives and fair values of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life.

The excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. If impaired, the carrying values of the assets are written down to fair value using Level 3 inputs. See Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of Level 3 fair value.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Management’s judgment is required to determine the provisions for income taxes and to determine whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. Accordingly, the facts and financial circumstances impacting deferred income tax assets are reviewed quarterly and management’s judgment is applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required, if any, in any given period.

Tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. Our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate, as well as related interest.

Industry 

We operate in the commercial vehicle market. There has historically been a high correlation between new product sales in the commercial vehicle market and the rate of change in U.S. industrial production and the U.S. gross domestic product.

Heavy-Duty Truck Market

The U.S. retail heavy-duty truck market is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, fuel prices, other methods of transportation, environmental and other government regulations, interest rate fluctuations and customer business cycles. According to data published by A.C.T. Research, total U.S. retail sales of new Class 8 trucks in the last ten years have ranged from a low of approximately 195,687 in 2020 to a high of approximately 281,440 in 2019. Class 8 trucks are defined by the American Automobile Association as trucks with a minimum gross vehicle weight rating above 33,000 pounds.

Typically, Class 8 trucks are assembled by manufacturers utilizing certain components that may be manufactured by other companies, including engines, transmissions, axles, wheels and other components. As commercial vehicles and certain commercial vehicle components have become increasingly complex, the ability to provide service for commercial vehicles has become an increasingly competitive factor in the industry. The ability to provide such service requires a significant capital investment in diagnostic and other equipment, parts inventory and highly trained service personnel. EPA and Department of Transportation regulatory guidelines for service processes, including collision center, paint work and waste disposal, require sophisticated equipment to ensure compliance with environmental and safety standards. Differentiation between commercial vehicle dealers has become less dependent on price competition and is increasingly based on a dealer’s ability to offer a wide variety of services to their clients in a timely manner to minimize vehicle downtime. Such services include the following: efficient, conveniently located and easily accessible commercial vehicle service centers with an adequate supply of replacement parts and other aftermarket products and services; financing for commercial vehicle purchases; leasing and rental programs; and the ability to accept multiple unit trade-ins related to large fleet purchases. We believe our one-stop center concept and the size and geographic diversity of our dealership network gives us a competitive advantage in providing these services.

A.C.T. Research currently estimates 252,000 new Class 8 trucks will be sold in the United States in 2025, compared to approximately 247,337 new Class 8 trucks sold in 2024. A.C.T. Research currently forecasts sales of new Class 8 trucks in the U.S. to be approximately 291,100 in 2026.

Medium-Duty Truck Market

Many of our Rush Truck Centers sell medium-duty commercial vehicles manufactured by Peterbilt, International, Hino, Ford or Isuzu, and provide parts and service for medium-duty commercial vehicles. Medium-duty commercial vehicles are principally used in short‑haul markets as delivery vehicles; they typically operate locally and generally do not leave their service areas overnight. We also sell light-duty vehicles (Class 3 and under) at several of our Ford dealerships.

A.C.T. Research currently forecasts sales of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles in the U.S. to be approximately 266,300 units in 2025, compared to 251,895 units in 2024.

Revenues

Total revenues decreased $120.3 million, or 1.5%, in 2024, compared to 2023.

Our Aftermarket Products and Services revenues decreased $46.1 million, or 1.8%, in 2024, compared to 2023. The decrease in Aftermarket Parts and Services revenues was primarily related to the ongoing freight recession.

Our revenues from sales of new and used commercial vehicles decreased $69.1 million, or 1.4%, in 2024, compared to 2023. The decrease in new and used commercial vehicle revenues was primarily a result of weak demand for Class 8 trucks caused by the ongoing freight recession and high interest rates, which was partially offset by strong demand for Class 4 through 7 medium-duty commercial vehicles.

We sold 15,465 new Class 8 trucks in 2024, a 11.4% decrease compared to 17,457 new heavy-duty trucks in 2023. Our share of the new U.S. Class 8 commercial vehicle sales market decreased to approximately 6.1% in 2024, from 6.2% in 2023. Our share of the new Canada Class 8 truck market was approximately 1.7% in 2024. The decrease in new commercial vehicle revenues was primarily a result of the ongoing freight recession and high interest rates.

We sold 13,935 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, including 1,230 buses, in 2024, a 5.1% increase compared to 13,264 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, including 1,564 buses, in 2023. In 2024, we achieved a 5.3% share of the Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle market in the U.S., compared to 5.1% in 2023. Our share of the Canada medium-duty commercial vehicles market was approximately 3.1% in 2024. The increase in our Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales in 2024 was primarily a result of strong demand and increased production of commercial vehicles from the manufacturers we represent.

We sold 2,105 new light-duty vehicles in 2024, a 13.9% increase compared to 1,848 new light-duty vehicles in 2023.

We sold 7,110 used commercial vehicles in 2024, a 0.1% decrease compared to 7,117 used commercial vehicles in 2023. We expect used commercial vehicle demand to remain at current levels. We also expect that the rate at which used commercial vehicles are depreciating will continue to decrease and that valuations will continue to stabilize during 2025.

Commercial vehicle lease and rental revenues increased $1.2 million, or 0.3%, in 2024, compared to 2023. This increase in commercial vehicle lease and rental revenues was primarily a result of steady demand for lease commercial vehicles, which was partially offset by decreased rental utilization.

Finance and insurance revenues decreased $2.3 million, or 9.4%, in 2024, compared to 2023. This decrease is primarily due to the mix of purchasers of commercial vehicles. We are more likely provide financing to owner-operators and smaller fleets, which comprised a smaller percentage of commercial vehicle sales during 2024. Finance and insurance revenues have limited direct costs and, therefore, contribute a disproportionate share of our operating profits.

Other revenues decreased $3.9 million, or 14.5% in 2024, compared to 2023. Other revenues consist primarily of the gains related to the disposition of our lease and rental fleet and document fees related to commercial vehicle sales.

Gross Profit

Gross profit decreased $61.7 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 19.6% in 2024, from 20.1% in 2023. This decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was a result of a change in our customer sales mix and pricing pressure due to the ongoing freight recession. Commercial vehicle sales, a lower margin revenue item, was 62.6% of total revenues in both 2024 and 2023. Aftermarket Products and Services revenues, a higher margin revenue item, decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenues to 32.2% in 2024, from 32.3% in 2023.

Table of Contents

Gross margins from our Aftermarket Products and Services operations decreased to 36.7% in 2024, from 37.2% in 2023. Gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services decreased to $924.5 million in 2024, from $952.8 million in 2023. This decrease is primarily related to the ongoing freight recession. Historically, parts operations’ gross margins range from 28% to 30% and service and collision center operations range from 66% to 68%. Gross profits from parts sales represented 58.0% of total gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services operations in 2024 and 59.5% in 2023. Service and collision center operations represented 42.0% of total gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services operations in 2024 and 40.5% 2023. We expect blended gross margins on Aftermarket Products and Services operations to range from 35.0% to 38.0% in 2025.

Gross margins on new Class 8 truck sales decreased to 8.9% in 2024, from 9.7% in 2023. In 2025, we expect overall gross margins from new heavy-duty truck sales of approximately 8.5% to 9.5%.

Gross margins on new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales increased to 9.2% in 2024, from 9.0% in 2023. This increase was primarily due to the mix of purchasers during 2024. For 2025, we expect overall gross margins from new medium-duty commercial vehicle sales of approximately 8.0% to 10.0%, but this will largely depend upon the mix of purchasers and types of vehicles sold.

Gross margins on used commercial vehicle sales increased to 18.9% in 2024, from 12.4% in 2023. This increase was primarily due to the successful execution of our used commercial vehicle sales strategy. We expect margins on used commercial vehicles to range between 13.0% and 18.0% in 2025.

Gross margins from commercial vehicle lease and rental sales decreased to 28.0% in 2024, from 29.9% in 2023. This decrease is primarily related to a decrease in rental utilization rates. We expect gross margins from lease and rental sales of approximately 27.0% to 29.0% during 2025. Our policy is to depreciate our lease and rental fleet using a straight-line method over each customer’s contractual lease term. The lease unit is depreciated to a residual value that approximates fair value at the expiration of the lease term. This policy results in us realizing reasonable gross margins while the unit is in service and a corresponding gain or loss on sale when the unit is sold at the end of the lease term.

Finance and insurance revenues and other revenues, as described above, have limited direct costs and, therefore, contribute a disproportionate share of gross profit.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses decreased $26.1 million, or 2.6%, in 2024, compared to 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from company initiatives to reduce operating expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 12.8% in 2024, from 12.9% in 2023. Annual SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues have ranged from 12.4% to 14.4% over the last five years. In general, when new and used commercial vehicle revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues will be at the lower end of this range. For 2025, we expect SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues to range from 11.5% to 13.5%. For 2025, we expect the selling portion of SG&A expenses to be 25.0% to 30.0% of new and used commercial vehicle gross profit.

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.7 million, or 14.6%, in 2024, compared to 2023.

Interest Expense, Net

Net interest expense increased $17.9 million, or 33.9%, in 2024, compared to 2023. This increase in interest expense is a result of the increase in inventory levels and rising interest rates on our variable rate debt compared to 2023. We expect net interest expense in 2025 to decrease compared to 2024 due to decreased commercial vehicle inventory levels and lower interest rates.

Income before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes decreased $64.2 million, or 13.9%, in 2024, compared to 2023, as a result of the factors described above.

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense decreased $21.2 million, or 18.6%, in 2024, compared to 2023, as a result of the factors described above. We provided for taxes at a 23.3% effective rate in 2024 and 24.7% in 2023. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23.0% to 25.0% of pretax income in 2025.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our short-term cash requirements are primarily for working capital, inventory financing, the renovation and expansion of existing facilities and the construction or purchase of new facilities. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through the retention of profits and borrowings under our floor plan arrangements and other credit agreements. As of December 31, 2024, we had working capital of approximately $736.1 million, including $228.1 million in cash, available to fund our operations. We believe that these funds, together with expected cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. From time to time, we utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under our various credit agreements. The resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our interest expense.

We continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon: (i) our cash and cash equivalents on hand; (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations; (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our secured line of credit, working capital lines of credit available under certain of our credit agreements and both our Peterbilt and BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreements; and (iv) the potential impact of our capital allocation strategy and any contemplated or pending future transactions, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, equity repurchases, dividends, or other capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, commitments and contingencies, debt repayments, acquisitions, capital expenditures and any operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.

We have a line of credit that provides for a maximum borrowing of $25.0 million. There were no advances outstanding under this secured line of credit as of December 31, 2024, however, $18.8 million was pledged to secure various letters of credit related to self-insurance products, leaving $6.2 million available for future borrowings as of December 31, 2024.

The BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the WF Credit Agreement require us to satisfy various financial ratios such as the leverage ratio, the asset coverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to debt secured by lease and rental units, the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the WF Credit Agreement. We do not anticipate any breach of the covenants in the foreseeable future.

We expect to purchase or lease commercial vehicles worth approximately $200.0 million to $250.0 million for our leasing operations during 2025, depending on customer demand. We also expect to make capital expenditures for the purchase of recurring items such as computers, shop tools and equipment and company vehicles of approximately $35.0 million to $40.0 million during 2025.

During the fourth quarter of 2024, we paid a cash dividend of $14.3 million. Additionally, on February 17, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, to be paid on March 18, 2025, to all shareholders of record as of March 3, 2025. The total dividend disbursement is estimated to be approximately $14.3 million. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, there is no assurance as to future dividends because the declaration and payment of such dividends is subject to the business judgment of our Board and will depend on historic and projected earnings, capital requirements, covenant compliance and financial conditions and such other factors as our Board deems relevant.

On December 2, 2024, we announced that our Board approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing management to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $150.0 million of our shares of Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock. In connection with the adoption of the new stock repurchase plan, we terminated the prior stock repurchase plan, which was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024. Repurchases, if any, will be made at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate and may be made through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The actual timing, number and value of repurchases under the stock repurchase program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, stock price and other factors, including those related to the ownership requirements of our dealership agreements with Peterbilt. As of December 31, 2024, we had repurchased $6.5 million of our shares of common stock under the current stock repurchase program. The current stock repurchase program expires on December 31, 2025, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

We anticipate funding the capital expenditures for the improvement and expansion of existing facilities and recurring expenses through our operating cash flows. We have the ability to fund the construction or purchase of new facilities through our operating cash flows or by financing.

We have no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2024. However, we will continue to purchase vehicles for our lease and rental operations and authorize capital expenditures for the improvement or expansion of our existing dealership facilities and construction or purchase of new facilities based on market opportunities.

On September 14, 2021, we entered into the WF Credit Agreement with the WF lenders and the WF Agent. Pursuant to the terms of the WF Credit Agreement (as amended), the WF Lenders have agreed to make up to $175.0 million of revolving credit loans for certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for our Idealease leasing and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. We expect to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for our Idealease lease and rental fleet. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the WF Credit Agreement from time to time until the maturity date. Borrowings under the WF Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on each interest payment date, as defined in the WF Credit Agreement, at (A) the daily SOFR plus (i) 1.25% or (ii) 1.5%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or (B) on or after the term SOFR transition date, the term SOFR plus (i) 1.25% or (ii) 1.5%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The WF Credit Agreement expires on September 14, 2026, although, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the WF Agent has the right to, or upon the request of the required lenders must, terminate the commitments and declare all outstanding principal and interest due and payable. We may terminate the commitments at any time. On December 31, 2024, we had approximately $153.4 million outstanding under the WF Credit Agreement.

In addition, we must maintain a minimum balance of $220.0 million or we are subject to an unused commitment fee 0.20% of the amount by which the average daily outstanding principal balance of the loan during such quarter is less than $220.0 million. Advances under the PLC Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the fifth day of the following month, at our option, at either (A) the prime rate, minus 2.10%, provided that the floating rate of interest is subject to a floor of 0%, or (B) a fixed rate, to be determined between us and PLC in each instance of borrowing at a fixed rate.

Most of our commercial vehicle purchases are made on terms requiring payment to the manufacturer within 15 to 60 days or less from the date the commercial vehicles are invoiced from the factory. Navistar Financial Corporation and Peterbilt offer trade terms that provide an interest-free inventory stocking period for certain new commercial vehicles. This interest-free period is 15 to 60 days. If the commercial vehicle is not sold within the interest-free period, we finance the commercial vehicle under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement or the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

On December 16, 2024, we entered into the new PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement with PFC. The PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement includes an aggregate loan commitment of $800.0 million for the financing of new Peterbilt trucks, tractors, chassis and other related equipment manufactured by Peterbilt. Borrowings under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the fifth day of the following month, at our option, at either (A) the prime rate, minus 2.10%, provided that the floating rate of interest is subject to a floor of 0%, or (B) a fixed rate, to be determined between us and PFC in each instance of borrowing at a fixed rate. The PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires December 16, 2029, although either party has the right to terminate the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement at any time upon 360 days written notice. On December 31, 2024, we had approximately $492.7 million outstanding under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement. We utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our gross interest expense under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

On September 14, 2021, we entered into the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement (as amended) with BMO and the lenders signatory thereto. This agreement had an aggregate loan commitment of $1.0 billion, which we utilized to finance all of our new and used commercial vehicle inventory in the United States until we entered into the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement. On December 12, 2024, we entered into an amendment of the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, the aggregate loan commitment was reduced from $1.0 billion to $675.0 million and the definition of “Inventory” was amended to remove trucks, tractors and chassis manufactured by Peterbilt. We utilize the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement to finance all of our new commercial vehicle inventory, except for equipment manufactured by Peterbilt, and all of our used commercial vehicle inventory and for working capital purposes. Borrowings under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable monthly, at (A) the greater of (i) zero and (ii) Term SOFR (as defined in the agreement), plus (B) 1.20%.

Advances required to be made in CAD dollars under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable monthly, at CORRA, plus 1.27%. Advances required to be made in USD dollars bear interest per annum, payable monthly, at SOFR (as defined in the agreement), plus 1.20%.

Cyclicality

Our business is dependent on a number of factors including general economic conditions, fuel prices, interest rate fluctuations, freight rates, credit availability, environmental and other government regulations and customer business cycles. Unit sales of new commercial vehicles have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on these general economic conditions. According to data published by A.C.T. Research, total U.S. retail sales of new Class 8 commercial vehicles have ranged from a low of approximately 195,687 in 2020, to a high of approximately 281,440 in 2019. Through geographic expansion, concentration on higher margin Aftermarket Products and Services and diversification of our customer base, we have attempted to reduce the negative impact of adverse general economic conditions or cyclical trends affecting the Class 8 commercial vehicle industry on our earnings.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market prices, including interest rate risk, and other relevant market rate or price risks.

We are exposed to market risk through interest rates related to the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement, the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement, the WF Credit Agreement, the PLC Agreement, the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement, the RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement and discount rates related to finance sales. The PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the PLC Agreement are both based on the prime rate. The BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the WF Credit Agreement are both based on SOFR. The RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement and RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement are both based on CORRA. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding floor plan borrowings and lease and rental fleet borrowings in the aggregate amount of $1,344.8 million. Assuming an increase or decrease in the prime rate, SOFR or CORRA of 100 basis points, annual interest expense could correspondingly increase or decrease by approximately $13.4 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Rush Enterprises, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Commercial Vehicle Inventory Reserves

Description of the Matter

At December 31, 2024, the Company’s commercial vehicle inventory balance is approximately $1.4 billion, which is net of management’s estimate of commercial vehicle inventory reserves in the amount of approximately $9.8 million. As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, management adjusts the value of its inventory to net realizable value to the extent it determines inventory cost cannot be recovered. Management estimates future demand and sales prices to calculate the commercial vehicle inventory reserves and to make corresponding adjustments to the carrying value of these inventories to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value.

Auditing management’s estimate of the commercial vehicle inventory reserves involved auditor subjective judgment because the estimate is sensitive to changes in management’s assumptions for forecasted product demand and future sales prices.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s processes to estimate the commercial vehicle inventory reserve, which included management’s review of the underlying significant assumptions.

Our substantive audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions described above, and we tested the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimation calculations. We also compared the cost of on-hand commercial vehicle inventories to customer demand forecasts and historical sales. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the commercial vehicle inventory reserves that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Table of Contents

Estimates in Financial Statements

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. Management analyzes the Company’s estimates based on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ materially from such estimates.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money market instruments. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash consists of deposits for the statutory restriction on cash related to the Company’s captive insurance company.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Repossession Losses

The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses based on the probability of default, its historical rate of losses, aging and current economic conditions. Accounts receivables consist primarily of commercial vehicle sales receivables, manufacturers’ receivables, leasing and parts and service receivables and other trade receivables. The Company writes off account balances when it has exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. These write-offs are charged against the allowance for credit losses.

The Company provides an allowance for repossession losses after considering historical loss experience and other factors that might affect the ability of customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the Company when the Company has a potential liability.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by specific identification of new and used commercial vehicle inventory. As the market value of the Company’s inventory typically declines over time, reserves are established based on historical loss experience and market trends. These reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of the Company’s inventory on hand. An allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the improvement, or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Provision for depreciation of property and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis. The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest, when incurred, is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the estimated useful life of such assets. The cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization and estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Purchase Price Allocation, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through acquisitions at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation for business combinations and asset acquisitions requires the use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. As a result, during the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for the acquisitions will result in an adjustment to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company determines whether substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is not a business. If not, the Company determines whether the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, meets the definition of a business.

In connection with the Company’s business combinations, it records certain intangible assets, including franchise rights. The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives and fair values of its identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life. See Note 15 – Acquisitions in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further discussion.

Goodwill represents the excess, at the date of acquisition, of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In addition to goodwill, the Company recognizes separately identifiable intangible assets for rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers.

The fair value of the intangible franchise right is determined at the acquisition date by discounting the projected cash flows specific to each acquisition. The carrying value of the Company’s manufacturer franchise rights was $
12.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and is included in Other Assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life, as there are no economic or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers’ brand names. Furthermore, to the extent that any agreements evidencing manufacturer franchise rights have expiration dates, the Company expects that it will be able to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the Company does not amortize manufacturer franchise rights.

Due to the fact that manufacturer franchise rights are specific to a geographic region, the Company has determined that evaluating and including all locations acquired in the geographic region is the appropriate level for purposes of testing franchise rights for impairment. The Company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of its individual franchises.

The Company assesses goodwill and intangible franchise rights for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. If impaired, the carrying values of the assets are written down to fair value using Level 3 inputs. See Fair Value Measurements below for further discussion of Level 3 fair value inputs.

Table of Contents

For the annual goodwill and intangible franchise rights impairment assessment conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment and determined that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the Company’s reporting units were less than their carrying values.

No
 impairments of goodwill or intangible franchise rights were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Equity Method Investments

On February 25, 2019, the Company acquired 
50
% of the equity interest in RTC Canada, which acquired the operating assets of Tallman Group, the largest International Truck dealer in Canada. Prior to acquiring an additional 
30
% equity interest on May 2, 2022, for approximately $
20.0
 million, the Company accounted for the equity interest in RTC Canada using the equity method of accounting. After the Company’s acquisition of the additional 
30
% equity interest on May 2, 2022, operations of RTC Canada were included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Income (loss) related to the 
20
% equity owner of RTC Canada is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. See Note 15 – Acquisitions in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further discussion.

On January 3, 2022, a subsidiary of Cummins, Inc. acquired a 
50
% equity interest in Natural Gas Fuel Systems, LLC (“NGFS”) from the Company for $
27.5
 million. NGFS previously conducted business as Momentum Fuel Technologies. The $
12.5
 million gain realized on the transaction is included in Other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company is accounting for the business as a joint venture and recognizes the investment using the equity method. The Company’s equity income in NGFS is included in the line-item Other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income Taxes

Management’s judgment is required to determine the provisions for income taxes and to determine whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable. Accordingly, the facts and financial circumstances impacting deferred income tax assets are reviewed quarterly and management’s judgment is applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required, if any, in any given period.

In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. The Company adjusts its annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

The Company’s income tax returns are periodically audited by tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions. In evaluating the exposures associated with its various tax filing positions, the Company adjusts its liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

50

Table of Contents

The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with its various filing positions. The Company’s effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Although the Company believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ, and the Company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of the Company’s cash and result in an increase in its effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the Company’s effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. The Company’s income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that it considers appropriate, as well as related interest.

Revenue Recognition Policies

The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASU 2014-09, “
Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(
“
Topic 606
”
)
, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.  The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations. The Company then assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct and recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. For a complete discussion of accounting for revenue, see Note 17 – Revenue of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Rental and Lease Revenue

The Company leases commercial vehicles that the Company owns to customers. Lease and rental revenues are recognized over the period of the related lease or rental agreement. Variable rental revenue is recognized when it is earned.

Cost of Sales

For the Company’s new and used commercial vehicle operations, cost of sales consists primarily of the Company’s actual purchase price, plus make-ready expenses, less any applicable manufacturers’ incentives. For the Company’s parts operations, cost of sales consists primarily of the Company’s actual purchase price, less any applicable manufacturers’ incentives. For the Company’s service and collision center operations, technician labor cost is the primary component of cost of sales. For the Company’s rental and leasing operations, cost of sales consists primarily of depreciation and amortization, rent, maintenance costs, license costs and interest expense on finance leases. There are no costs of sales associated with the Company’s finance and insurance revenue or other revenue.

Leases

The Company leases commercial vehicles and real estate under finance and operating leases. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at its inception. For leases with terms greater than twelve months, the Company records a lease asset and liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. Many of the Company’s leases include renewal options and termination options that are factored into its determination of lease payments when appropriate.

When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of its leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company must estimate its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.

Taxes Assessed by a Governmental Authority 

The Company accounts for sales taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction on a net (excluded from revenues) basis.

Table of Contents

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of incentive-based compensation for sales, finance and general management personnel, salaries for administrative personnel and expenses for rent, marketing, insurance, utilities and other general operating purposes.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company applies the provisions of ASC topic 718-10, “
Compensation 
–
 Stock Compensation,
” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on estimated fair values.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods.

Compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

The Company determines the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model that is affected by the Company’s stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected stock option exercise behaviors. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Company’s stock options have characteristics that are significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, in management’s opinion, the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of fair value and it may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a market transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller.

The following table reflects the weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during each period using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions used:

The Company computes its historical stock price volatility in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

Accounting for Internal Use Software

The Company’s accounting policy with respect to accounting for computer software developed or obtained for internal use is consistent with ASC topic 350-40 
(Internal Use Software)
, which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and identifies characteristics of internal-use software. The Company has capitalized software costs, including capitalized interest, of approximately $
1.8
 million as of December 31, 2024, net of accumulated amortization of $
17.2
 million, and had $
3.0
 million as of December 31, 2023, net of accumulated amortization of $
16.0
 million.

Insurance

The Company utilizes a captive insurance company to manage its auto and general commercial liability insurance, which the Company supplements with excess insurance coverage at a level management believes is sufficient. The Company is partially self-insured for a portion of the claims related to its worker’s compensation and medical insurance. The Company uses actuarial information provided from third-party administrators to calculate an accrual for claims incurred, but not reported, and for the remaining portion of claims that have been reported. The Company is fully self-insured for claims related to its real and personal property, except for its vehicle inventory, which is fully insured. 

Fair Value Measurements

The Company has various financial instruments that it must measure at fair value on a recurring basis. See Note 9 – Financial Instruments and Fair Value of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information. The Company also applies the provisions of fair value measurement to various nonrecurring measurements for its financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities.

Applicable accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The Company measures its assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about what factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available, including its own data.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued updated accounting guidance related to annual and interim segment disclosures (ASU 2023-07). The updated accounting guidance, among other things, intends to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. We adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of 2024, by identifying the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), identifying and aggregating operating segments, determining reportable segments and including significant segment expenses reviewed by the Company’s CODM. Refer to Note 16, Segment Reporting, for our updated presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and allows for early adoption. These requirements are not expected to have an impact on our financial statements but will impact our income tax disclosures.

Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements

The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various manufacturers of commercial vehicles and buses (“Manufacturers”). These agreements are nonexclusive agreements that allow the Company to stock, sell at retail and service commercial vehicles and sell parts from the Manufacturers in the Company’s defined area of responsibility. The agreements allow the Company to use the Manufacturers’ names, trade symbols and intellectual property and expire as follows:

These agreements, as well as agreements with various other Manufacturers, impose a number of restrictions and obligations on the Company, including restrictions on a change in control of the Company and the maintenance of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of these restrictions could result in the loss of the Company’s right to purchase the Manufacturers’ products and use the Manufacturers’ trademarks.

The Company purchases its new Peterbilt vehicles from Peterbilt and most of the parts sold at its Peterbilt dealerships from PACCAR, Inc, the parent company of Peterbilt, at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new Peterbilt commercial vehicles accounted for approximately 
58.8
% of the Company’s new vehicle sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, 
50.7
% of the Company’s new vehicle sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 
59.6
% of the Company’s new vehicle sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Primary Lenders

The Company purchases its new and used commercial vehicle inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs as described in Note 7 to these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company finances its Peterbilt new vehicle inventory under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement with PFC, which has an aggregate loan commitment of $
800.0
 million. The remainder of the Company’s new vehicle inventory, and all of its used vehicle inventory, is financed under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement with BMO Bank, N.A., which has an aggregate loan commitment of $
675.0
 million. The Company’s floor plan financing agreements provide that the occurrence of certain events will be considered events of default. In the event that the Company’s floor plan financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship with any of its current primary lenders terminates, the Company would need to obtain similar financing from other sources. Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan financing or alternative financing if necessary.

From time to time, the Company uses the WF Credit Agreement to finance its Idealease lease and rental fleet vehicles and for other working capital needs. Pursuant to the terms of the WF Credit Agreement, the WF Lenders have agreed to make up to $
175.0
 million of revolving credit loans for certain of the Company’s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for the Company’s Idealease lease and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. The Company expects to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for the Company’s Idealease lease, rental fleet and other working capital needs.

RTC Canada uses the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement to finance its Idealease lease and rental fleet vehicles. Pursuant to the terms of the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to $
120.0
 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance certain of RTC Canada’s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through RTC Canada’s Idealease franchise, with an additional $
20.0
 million available upon the request of RTC Canada and consent of BMO.

RTC Canada uses the RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement to finance its new and used vehicle inventory. Pursuant to the terms of the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to $
116.7
 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance RTC Canada’s purchase of new and used vehicle inventory.

Concentrations of Credit Risks

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash with what it considers to be quality financial institutions based on periodic assessments of such institutions. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.

The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and by selling most of its trade receivables, other than vehicle accounts receivable, without recourse. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are reduced because of the geographical diversity of the Company’s customer base; however, all the Company’s business is concentrated in the United States and Ontario, Canada commercial vehicle markets and related aftermarkets.

The Company sells finance contracts it enters into with customers to finance the purchase of commercial vehicles to third parties. These finance contracts are sold by the Company both with and without recourse. Most of the Company’s finance contracts are sold without recourse. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and a reserve for repossession losses related to finance contracts sold with recourse. Historically, the Company’s allowances and reserves have covered losses inherent in these receivables.

Inventory

The Company provides a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving parts. The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis. The Company relies on historical information to support its reserve. Once the inventory is written down, the Company does not reverse any reserve balance until the inventory is sold.

The valuation for new and used commercial vehicle inventory is based on specific identification. A detail of new and used commercial vehicle inventory is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments to the value of specific vehicles are made on a quarterly basis.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of accounts receivable expected to be collected. Under Accounting Standards Topic 326, 
Financial Instruments 
–
 Credit Losses
, the Company is required to remeasure expected credit losses for financial instruments held on the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts.

Accounts receivable consists primarily of commercial vehicle sales receivables, manufacturers’ receivables and leasing, parts and service sales receivables and other trade receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses based on the probability of default, its historical rate of losses, aging and current economic conditions. The Company writes off account balances when it has exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. These write-offs are charged against the allowance for credit losses.

FLOOR PLAN NOTES PAYABLE AND LINE OF CREDIT
:

Floor Plan Notes Payable 

Floor plan notes are financing agreements to facilitate the Company’s purchase of new and used commercial vehicle inventory. These notes are collateralized by the inventory purchased, and accounts receivable arising from the sale thereof. The Company’s BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement with BMO Bank, N.A. provides for a loan commitment of up to $
675.0
million. The interest rate under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement is the one-month SOFR, plus 
1.20
%. The effective interest rate applicable to the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement was approximately 
5.69
% as of December 31, 2024. The Company utilizes its excess cash on hand to pay down its outstanding borrowings under its BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to the Company’s gross interest expense under the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

The Company’s PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement with PFC provides for a loan commitment of up to $
800.0
 million. The interest rate under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement is the prime rate, minus 
2.10
%. The effective interest rate applicable to the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement was approximately 
5.4
% as of December 31, 2024. The Company utilizes its excess cash on hand to pay down its outstanding borrowings under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to the Company’s gross interest expense under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

The Company’s RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement provides for a loan commitment of up to $
116.7
 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance RTC Canada’s purchase of new and used vehicle inventory. Loans to purchase used vehicle inventory are limited to twenty percent (
20
%) of the credit limit available at such time. RTC Canada may borrow, repay and reborrow loans from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the credit limits set forth above with respect to new and used vehicles. Advances under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the first business day of each calendar month, payable monthly, at CORRA, plus 
1.27
%.

The Company finances all of the purchase price of its new commercial vehicle inventory and the loan value of its used commercial vehicle inventory under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement, the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement, under which BMO Bank, N.A., PFC and BMO pay the manufacturer directly with respect to new commercial vehicles. Amounts borrowed under the agreements are due when the related commercial vehicle inventory (collateral) is sold. The BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires December 31, 2029, although BMO Bank, N.A. has the right to terminate the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement at any time upon 360 days written notice and the Company may terminate at any time, subject to specified limited exceptions. The PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires December 16, 2029, although either party has the right to terminate the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement at any time upon 360 days written notice.

492.7
 million outstanding under the PFC Floor Plan Credit Agreement. On December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
389.3
 million outstanding under its BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement. The Company’s RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires September 14, 2026. On December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
78.2
 million CAD outstanding under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement.

4.4
% for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 
3.3
% for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is net of interest related to prepayments of new and used inventory loans.

175.0
 million of revolving credit loans for certain of the Company’s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for the Company’s Idealease lease and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. Borrowings under the WF Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on each interest payment date, at (A) SOFR plus (i) 
1.25

1.5
%, depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The WF Credit Agreement expires on September 14, 2026, although, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the WF Agent has the right to, or upon the request of the required lenders must, terminate the commitments and declare all outstanding principal and interest due and payable. The Company may terminate the commitments at any time. The Company expects to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for the Company’s Idealease lease and rental fleet.

On November 1, 2023, the Company entered into the PLC Agreement with PFC. Pursuant to the terms of the PLC Agreement (as amended), PLC agreed to make up to $
500.0
 million of revolving credit loans to finance certain of the Company’s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through its PacLease franchises.

220.0
 million. Advances under the PLC Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the fifth day of the following month, at the Company’s option, at either (A) the prime rate, minus

On May 31, 2022, RTC Canada entered into the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement with BMO. Pursuant to the terms of the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to $
120.0
 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance certain of RTC Canada’s capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through RTC Canada’s Idealease franchise, with an additional $
20.0
 million CAD available upon the request of RTC Canada and consent of BMO. Borrowings under the RTC Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest per annum payable monthly at CORRA, plus

The WF Credit Agreement, PLC Agreement and RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement are general borrowing facilities, whereas prior to these credit agreements, interest expense associated with the Company’s lease and rental fleet was recorded in cost of sales as the borrowings were directly related to each lease and rental vehicle.

The BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the WF Credit Agreement require the Company to satisfy various financial ratios such as the leverage ratio, the asset coverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants related to the BMO Floor Plan Credit Agreement and the WF Credit Agreement. The Company does not anticipate any breach of the covenants in the foreseeable future.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE
:

The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and floor plan notes payable. The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments approximate fair value due either to their short-term nature or existence of variable interest rates, which approximate market rates. Certain methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of financial instruments as of December 31, 2024, and 2023. The carrying value of current assets and current liabilities approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of these items.

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is based on secondary market indicators. Because the Company’s debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation’s characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral and liquidity. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the valuation measurement inputs of its long-term debt represent, at its lowest level, current market interest rates available to the Company for similar debt and the Company’s current credit standing. The Company has categorized such debt within Level 2 of the hierarchy framework. The carrying amount approximates fair value.

10.

LEASES
:

The Company’s accounting policy with respect to leases complies with ASU 842, 
Leases
. The standard requires lessees to record assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.

A lease is classified as a finance lease if any of the following conditions exist on the date of lease commencement:

●

The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term.

●

The lease provides the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset, and that option is reasonably certain to be exercised.

●

The lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset.

●

The present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying asset.

●

The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications.

●

The lessor expects to have no alternative use for the leased asset at the end of the lease.

59

Table of Contents

The Company applied the practical expedients permitted under Topic 842, which among other things, allowed it to retain its existing assessment of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease and whether such lease is classified as an operating or finance lease. The Company made an accounting policy election that keeps leases with an initial term of twelve months or less off the balance sheet and results in recognizing those lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company leases certain commercial vehicles and real estate under finance and operating leases. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at its inception. For leases with terms greater than twelve months, the Company records the related asset and obligation at the present value of lease payments over the term. Many of the Company’s leases include renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into its determination of lease payments when appropriate. The Company has elected not to account for lease and nonlease components as a single combined lease component as lessee. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of its leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company must estimate its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.

Lease of Vehicles as Lessee

The Company leases commercial vehicles as the lessee under finance leases and operating leases. The lease terms vary from 
one
 year to 
ten
 years. These vehicles are then subleased or rented by the Company to customers under various agreements. The Company received sublease income under non-cancelable subleases of $
54.3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and $
50.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Company usually guarantees the residual value of vehicles under operating lease and finance lease arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company guaranteed commercial vehicle residual values of approximately $
69.8
 million under operating lease and finance lease arrangements.

Lease of Facilities as Lessee

The Company’s facility leases are classified as operating and finance leases and primarily reflect its use of dealership facilities and office space. The lease terms vary from 
one
 year to 
83
 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term, and some of which include options to terminate the lease within 
one
 year. The Company considers these options in determining the lease term used to establish its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

The Company leases facilities in Ontario, Canada from entities owned by the noncontrolling interest holder of RTC Canada. In 2024, the Company recorded approximately $
2.0
 million in operating lease expense related to these leases.

Lease of Vehicles as Lessor 

The Company leases commercial vehicles that the Company owns to customers primarily over periods of 
one
 to 
ten
 years. The Company applied the practical expedient permitted within Topic 842 that allows it not to separate lease and nonlease components. Nonlease components typically consist of maintenance and licensing for the commercial vehicle. The variable nonlease components are generally based on mileage. Some leases contain an option for the lessee to purchase the commercial vehicle.

The Company’s policy is to depreciate its lease and rental fleet using a straight-line method over each customer’s contractual lease term. The lease unit is depreciated to a residual value that approximates fair value at the expiration of the lease term. This policy results in the Company realizing reasonable gross margins while the unit is in service and a corresponding gain or loss on sale when the unit is sold at the end of the lease term.

Sales-type leases are recognized by the Company as lease receivables. The lessee obtains control of the underlying asset and the Company recognizes sales revenue upon lease commencement. The receivable for sales-type leases as of December 31, 2024, in the amount of $
4.7
 million is reflected in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Employee Incentive Plans

In May 2007, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush Enterprises, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2007 Incentive Plan”). The 2007 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options (which may be nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options for tax purposes), stock appreciation rights issued independent of or in tandem with such options (“SARs”), restricted stock awards and performance awards. The 2007 Incentive Plan was amended and restated on May 20, 2014, May 16, 2017, May 12, 2020, and May 16, 2023. The number of shares available for issuance under the plan include 
21,600,000
 shares of Class A common stock and 
9,000,000
 shares of Class B common stock.

The aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to stock options or SARs that may be granted to any one participant in any year under the 2007 Incentive Plan is 
150,000
 shares of Class A common stock or 
150,000
 shares of Class B common stock. Each option granted pursuant to the 2007 Incentive Plan has a 
ten
-year term from the grant date and vests in three equal annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of the grant date. The Company has 
21,600,000
 shares of Class A common stock and 
9,000,000
 shares of Class B common stock reserved for issuance under the Company’s 2007 Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, approximately

Stock Awards

The Company granted restricted stock awards to certain of its employees under the 2007 Incentive Plan and unrestricted stock awards to its non-employee directors under the Director Plan during the year ended December 31, 2024. The restricted stock awards granted to employees vest in 
three
 equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date and are forfeited in the event the recipient’s employment or relationship with the Company is terminated prior to vesting, except as a result of retirement or under certain circumstances associated with a change of control or involuntary termination, as further described in the Company’s executive transition plan. The fair value of the restricted stock awards granted to the Company’s employees is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the restricted stock’s vesting period. The shares granted to non-employee directors are expensed on the grant date.

Defined Contribution Plan

The Company has a defined contribution plan (the “Rush 401k Plan”) that is available to all U.S. based employees. Each employee who has completed 30 days of continuous service is entitled to enter the Rush 401k Plan on the first day of the following month. Participating employees may contribute from 
1
% to 
50
% of their total gross compensation. However, certain highly compensated employees are limited to a maximum contribution of 
15
% of total gross compensation. The Company’s policy is for the first 
10
% of an employee’s contribution, the Company contributes an amount equal to 
20
% of the employees’ contributions for those employees with less than five years of service and an amount equal to 
40
% of the employees’ contributions for those employees with more than five years of service. The Company incurred expenses related to the Rush 401k Plan of approximately $
14.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, $
13.3
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, and $
12.1
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Deferred Compensation Plan

On November 6, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Rush Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”) pursuant to which certain employees and directors may elect to defer a portion of their annual compensation. The Deferred Compensation Plan was amended and restated effective May 18, 2021, in order to bring the plan into conformance with current “best” practices. The Company established a rabbi trust to finance obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan with corporate-owned variable life insurance contracts. Participants are 
100
% vested in their respective deferrals and the earnings thereon. The first deferral election period began on January 1, 2011. The Company’s liability related to the Deferred Compensation Plan was $
28.1
 million on December 31, 2024, and $
24.8
 million on December 31, 2023. The related cash surrender value of the life insurance contracts was $
24.4
 million on December 31, 2024, and $
18.0
 million on December 31, 2023.

The Company currently does not provide any post-retirement benefits, nor does it provide any post-employment benefits.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
:

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) were computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS differs from basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially dilutive options and restricted stock awards that were outstanding during the period.

Each share of Class A common stock ranks equal to each share of Class B common stock with respect to receipt of any dividends or distributions declared on shares of common stock and the right to receive proceeds on liquidation or dissolution of the Company after payment of its indebtedness and liquidation preference payments to holders of any preferred shares. However, holders of Class A common stock have 1/20th of one vote per share on all matters requiring a shareholder vote, while holders of Class B common stock have one full vote per share.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations for income from continuing operations (in thousands, except per share amounts):

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
39.2
 million in state net operating loss carry forwards that expire from 2030 to 2043, which result in a deferred tax asset of approximately $
1.7
 million. The Company has evaluated whether its state net operating losses are realizable and has not recorded a valuation allowance against them. The valuation allowance did 
not
 change over the prior year ending December 31, 2023.

The Company had unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $
8.0
 million as a component of accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2024, and $
6.7
 million as of December 31, 2023, the total of which, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. An unfavorable settlement would require a charge to income tax expense and a favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized approximately $
197,700
, $
86,200
, and $
22,800
 in interest expense. 
No
 amounts were accrued for penalties. The Company had approximately $
530,000
, $
389,000
 and $
302,000
 of interest accrued as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Undistributed earnings of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $
26.1
 million at December 2024 and $
22.9
 million at December 2023. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon repatriation of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to state and local taxes, and/or withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. The Company expects to be able to take a 
100
% dividends received deduction to offset any U.S. federal income tax liability on the distribution of untaxed earnings and profits.

The Company does not anticipate a significant change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2024, the tax years ended December 31, 
2021
 through 2024 remained subject to audit by federal tax authorities and the tax years ended December 31, 
2020
 through 2024, remained subject to audit by state tax authorities.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
:

From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. The Company maintains liability insurance, through self-insurance and third-party excess insurance, including product liability coverage, in amounts deemed adequate by management. However, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or claim for which indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company believes that there are no pending claims or litigation, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred.

ACQUISITIONS:

The following acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, were considered business combinations accounted for under ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” Pro forma information is not included in accordance with ASC 805 since no acquisitions were considered material individually or in the aggregate.

On July 15, 2024, the Company acquired certain assets of Nebraska Peterbilt, which included real estate and a Peterbilt commercial vehicle franchise in Grand Island and North Platte, Nebraska, along with commercial vehicle and parts inventory. The transaction was valued at approximately $
16.5
 million, with the purchase price paid in cash.

On December 4, 2023, the Company acquired certain assets of Freeway Ford Truck Sales, Inc., which included real estate and a Ford commercial vehicle franchise in Chicago, Illinois, along with commercial vehicle and parts inventory. The transaction was valued at approximately $
16.3
 million, with the purchase price paid in cash.

On November 7, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of Scheppers International Truck Center, Inc., which included real estate and an International truck franchise in Jefferson City, Missouri, along with commercial vehicle and parts inventory. The transaction was valued at approximately $
6.8
 million, with the purchase price paid in cash.

On May 2, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional 
30
% equity interest in RTC Canada, resulting in an 
80
% controlling interest in RTC Canada. The acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition achieved in stages under ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
. The acquisition-date fair value of the previous 
50
% equity interest was $
44.7
 million, resulting in a gain of $
7.0
 million included in the line-item Other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company also recognized a reversal of deferred tax liabilities of $
2.2
 million and $
0.6
 million related to reclassification of the foreign currency translation adjustment related to the remeasurement of the Company’s previous equity method investment in RTC Canada.

As of May 2, 2022, the Company established a noncontrolling interest related to the minority holders. The fair value of the 
20
% noncontrolling interest in RTC Canada is estimated to be $
17.8
 million. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was estimated using a combination of the income approach and a market approach. Since RTC Canada is a private company, the fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement
. The fair value estimates are based on: (i) a discount rate of 
11
%; (ii) a terminal value based on a long-term sustainable growth rate of 
3
%; (iii) financial multiples of companies in the same industry as RTC Canada; and (iv) adjustments because of the lack of control or lack of marketability that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in RTC Canada.

The goodwill of $

Prior to May 2, 2022, the Company accounted for its 
50
% equity interest in RTC Canada as an equity-method investment. After the Company’s acquisition of the additional 
30
% equity interest on May 2, 2022, operations of RTC Canada are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

SEGMENTS
:

The Company reports information based on operating segments identified in accordance with how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates business performance and allocates resources. As of the reporting period, the Company operates with one CODM: W.M. “Rusty” Rush, the Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board.

As of the reporting period, 
T
he Company currently has 
one
 reportable business segment - the Truck Segment. The Truck Segment includes the Company’s operation of a network of commercial vehicle dealerships in the United States and Ontario, Canada that provide an integrated one-stop source for the commercial vehicle needs of its customers, including retail sales of new and used commercial vehicles; aftermarket parts sales, service and collision center facilities; vehicle upfitting and financial services, including the financing of new and used commercial vehicle purchases, insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The commercial vehicle dealerships are deemed a single reporting unit because they have similar economic characteristics. The Company’s CODM considers the entire Truck Segment, not individual dealerships or departments within its dealerships, when making decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assessing its performance.

In addition to the Truck Segment, the Company generates revenue from 
two
 additional operating segments: Retail Tire Sales and Insurance Services. These operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting as specified under the guidance of ASU 2023-07. Therefore, they are consolidated under the “All Other” category in the segment disclosures below. These segments share accounting policies consistent with the summary of significant accounting policies.

REVENUE
:

The Company’s revenues are primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers. Those sales contain a single delivery element and revenue from such sales is recognized when the customer obtains control, which is typically when the finished product is delivered to the customer. The Company’s material revenue streams have been identified as the following: the sale of new and used commercial vehicles, arrangement of associated commercial vehicle financing and insurance contracts, the performance of commercial vehicle repair services and the sale of commercial vehicle parts. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.

The following table summarizes the Company’s disaggregated revenue by revenue source, excluding lease and rental revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

The Company’s performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time. The Company did not have any material contract assets or contract liabilities on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, or December 31, 2023. Revenues related to commercial vehicle sales, parts sales, commercial vehicle repair service, finance and most other revenues are related to the Truck Segment.

For the sale of new and used commercial vehicles, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is when delivery of the commercial vehicle occurs. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the commercial vehicle. When control is transferred to the customer, the Company has an unconditional right to payment and a receivable is recorded for any consideration not received.

The Company controls the commercial vehicle before it is transferred to the customer and it obtains all the remaining benefits from the commercial vehicle relating to the sale, ability to pledge the asset or hold the asset. The Company is a principal in all commercial vehicle transactions. The Company retains inventory risk, determines the selling price to the customer and delivers the commercial vehicle to the customer. The Company generally pays a commission to internal sales representatives for the sale of a commercial vehicle. The Company will continue to expense the commission and recognize it concurrently with the respective commercial vehicle sale revenue upon delivery of the commercial vehicle to a customer.

Revenue from the sale of parts is recognized when the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer and consideration has been received in the form of cash or a receivable from the customer. The Company provides its customers the right to return certain eligible parts, estimates the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience and records an allowance for estimated returns, which has historically not been material.

Revenue from the sale of commercial vehicle repair service is recognized when the service performed by the Company on a customer’s vehicle is complete and the customer accepts the repair. Because the Company does not have an enforceable right to payment while the repair is being performed, revenue is recognized when the repair is complete. After a customer’s acceptance, the Company has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and consideration has been received in the form of cash or a receivable from the customer.

Any remaining performance obligations represent service orders for which work has not been completed. The Company’s service contracts are predominately short-term in nature with a contract term of one month or less. For those contracts, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in Topic 606 exempting the Company from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.

The Company receives commissions from third-party lenders for arranging customer financing for the purchase of commercial vehicles. The receipt of such commissions is deemed to be a single performance obligation that is satisfied when a financing agreement is executed and accepted by the financing provider. Once the contract has been accepted by the financing provider, the Company’s performance obligation has been satisfied and the Company generally has no further obligations under the contract. The Company is the agent in this transaction, as it does not have control over the acceptance of the customer’s financing arrangement by the financing provider. Consideration paid to the Company by the financing provider is based on the agreement between the Company and the financing provider.

The Company receives commissions from third-party insurance companies for arranging insurance coverage for customers. The receipt of such commissions is deemed to be a single performance obligation that is satisfied when the insurance coverage is bound. The Company has no further obligations under the contract. The Company is the agent in this transaction because it does not have control over the insurance coverage provided by the insurance carrier. Consideration paid to the Company by the insurance provider is based on the agreement between the Company and the insurance provider.

The Company records revenues from finance and insurance products at the net commission amount, which includes estimates of chargebacks that can occur if the underlying contract is not fulfilled. Chargeback amounts for commissions from financing companies are estimated assuming financing contracts are terminated before the customer has made six monthly payments. Chargeback amounts for commissions from insurance companies are estimated assuming insurance contracts are terminated before the underlying insurance contractual term has expired. Chargeback reserve amounts are based on historical chargebacks and have historically been immaterial. The Company does not have any right to retrospective commissions based on future profitability of finance and insurance contracts arranged.

Other revenue consists mostly of documentation fees that are charged to customers in connection with the sale of a commercial vehicle and recognized as other revenue when a truck is sold. The Company recognizes the documentation fees at the point in time when the commercial vehicle is delivered to the customer.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management
’
s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on the assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this annual report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, is included in this Item 9A.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Rush Enterprises, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Rush Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Rush Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

73

Table of Contents

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
