Market Information for Common Stock
Our Class A common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “LYFT.” Our Class B common stock is neither listed nor traded.
Holders of Record
As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 234 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these record holders. 
As of December 31, 2024, there were 6 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock. All shares of Class B common stock are beneficially owned by either Logan Green or John Zimmer.
Dividend Policy
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Stock Performance Graph
This performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or incorporated by reference into any filing of Lyft, Inc. under the Securities Act.

We define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is identified by a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and that rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter, that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App. 
In each of the three month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2024, Active Riders increased compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to our focus on rider engagement, improved retention and overall marketplace health which resulted in Active Riders reaching an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Rides
Rides represent the level of usage of our multimodal platform. 
We define Rides as the total number of rides including rideshare and bike and scooter rides completed using our multimodal platform that contribute to our revenue. These include any Rides taken through our Lyft App. If multiple riders take a private rideshare ride, including situations where one party picks up another party on the way to a destination, or splits the bill, we count this as a single rideshare ride. Each unique segment of a Shared Ride is considered a single Ride. For example, if two riders successfully match in Shared Ride mode and both complete their Rides, we count this as two Rides. We have largely shifted away from Shared Rides, and now only offer Shared Rides in limited markets. We include all Rides taken by riders via our Concierge offering, even though such riders may be excluded from the definition of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App. 
The increase in Rides in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was due primarily to our improved marketplace health which also resulted in both Rides and Active Riders reaching all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)
Gross Bookings is a key indicator of the scale and impact of our overall platform.
We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees, excluding tips to drivers. Gross Bookings also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express Drive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter rentals, and amounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station hardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data access agreements. Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the same period. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.
The increase in Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was due primarily to Rides growth which benefited from increased ride frequency, which is demonstrated by Rides growth exceeding Active Riders growth, and improvements in marketplace health. Gross Bookings can be impacted by marketplace health and competitive dynamics and near the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, we believe pricing pressure due to a dynamic competitive environment and softer ride volume had a moderate negative impact on Gross Bookings.
The improvements in net income (loss) as a percentage of Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 were due primarily to Rides growth due to competitive pricing and improved marketplace health. Additionally, our net income (loss) in the year ended December 31, 2024 included a $29.6 million gain related to a lease termination which positively impacted net income (loss) as a percentage of Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2024, but did not have a similar impact in 2023.
Components of Results of Operations 
Revenue
Revenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales, revenue from licensing and data access agreements and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of our platform. Revenue derived from these offerings is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
Revenue also consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive and our network of Light Vehicles, which includes revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings is recognized in accordance with ASC 842 as described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
55
We offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received. 
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily includes insurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing and bike and scooter rentals and also include occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, personnel-related compensation costs, depreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges and costs related to Flexdrive, which include vehicle lease expenses and remarketing gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles. 
Operations and Support
Operations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email and chat support to users, Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, fees paid to third-parties providing operations support, facility costs and certain car rental fleet support costs. Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks. 
Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders, advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. 
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that are generally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees, policy spend, depreciation, facility costs and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. 
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discount. Interest expense also includes interest incurred on our Non-Revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted and unrestricted short-term investments as well as sublease income.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state taxes in the U.S. and foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the future. 
We have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized. However, based on our current and anticipated future earnings, our management believes it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence of sustained U.S. profitability may become available in the foreseeable future to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on the level of profitability that we are actually able to achieve. A release of all or a portion of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.

Revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 31%, in 2024 as compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in demand as we benefited from improvements in marketplace health which was reflected in the increases in Gross Bookings, Rides and Active Riders in 2024 as compared to 2023. Investments in driver supply, which are recorded as a reduction to revenue, decreased by $325.7 million in 2024 as compared to the prior year.

Cost of revenue increased $793.8 million, or 31%, in 2024 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $687.5 million increase in insurance costs driven by higher costs per mile paired with increased ride volume. There were also increases of $71.4 million in transaction fees due to higher ride volume, $19.6 million in depreciation and $16.8 million in Flexdrive related costs due to decreased gains from the sale of vehicles in 2024 as compared to 2023.
We expect to see cost of revenue increase in the near term on a year-over-year basis due to higher insurance costs driven by recent economic factors and the renewals of our third party insurance agreements.

These increases were partially offset by decreases of $32.5 million in stock-based compensation and $26.3 million in personnel-related costs driven by a reduction in headcount after the restructuring events initiated in the third quarter of 2024 and in prior years. There was also a decrease of $34.7 million in facilities costs primarily driven by a $29.6 million gain as a result of an amendment to the lease of our San Francisco headquarters which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 and impairment charges related to real estate lease right-of-use assets due to the restructuring events initiated in prior years.

_______________
(1)
Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a non-GAAP financial measure.
(2)
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet. 
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) 
Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is a key metric, both of which our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA. 
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for:
•
interest expense;
•
other income (expense), net;
•
provision for (benefit from) income taxes;
•
depreciation and amortization;
•
stock-based compensation;
•
payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;
•
sublease income;
•
gain from lease termination, if any;
•
costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any; and
•
restructuring charges, if any.
Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the same period.
We announced restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of 2022, second quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024 to reduce operating expenses and align strategic priorities. We believe the costs associated with the restructurings are distinguishable from ongoing operating costs and do not reflect current or expected performance of our ongoing operations. We believe the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our ongoing operating performance and provide for better comparability with our historically disclosed Adjusted 
60
EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts. Refer to Note 15 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these restructuring plans. 
We sublease certain office space and earn sublease income. Sublease income is included within other income, net on our consolidated statement of operations, while the related lease expense is included within operating expenses and loss from operations. We believe the adjustment to include sublease income in Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance, including the benefits of recent transactions, by presenting sublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease charges within our operating expenses. 
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we terminated a portion of the lease for our San Francisco headquarters. The right-of-use asset associated with the portion of this lease was previously impaired as part of our restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2023, and the extinguishment of the remaining lease liability resulted in the recorded gain within operating lease costs. We believe this does not reflect the current period performance of our ongoing operations and that the adjustment to exclude this gain from lease termination from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess Lyft’s ongoing operating performance and provide for better comparability with Lyft’s historically disclosed Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts. Refer to Note 9 “Leases” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this gain from lease termination.
For more information regarding the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss)
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted Net Income (Loss). 
We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for:
•
amortization of intangible assets;
•
stock-based compensation;
•
payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;
•
gain from lease termination, if any;
•
costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any; 
•
impairment charges, if any; and
•
restructuring charges, if any.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as our management no longer uses this metric for purposes of understanding and evaluating our operating performance.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides our management, board of directors, and investors with information about our ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of our balance sheet, further invest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet. 
Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. For more information regarding the limitations of free cash flow and a reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flow, see the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
We use our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain 
61
expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as our management no longer uses this metric for purposes of understanding and evaluating our operating performance. 
Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure to 
Adjusted EBITDA. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions):

Operating Activities 
Cash provided by operating activities was $849.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which consisted of net income of $22.8 million adjusted for $375.1 million of non-cash items, and changes in working capital of $451.9 million. The year over year improvement in net income (loss) was $363.1 million, from a net loss of $340.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to a net income of $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
 Non-cash adjustments included stock-based compensation expense of $330.9 million, which decreased year over year due to a reduction in headcount driven by the restructuring activities initiated in prior years, and depreciation and amortization expense of $148.9 million. The changes in working capital were primarily driven by insurance, which saw (i) an increase in our insurance reserves due to a rise in commercial auto insurance rates on a per mile basis compared to the prior year, an increase in ride volume in 2024 compared to the previous period and strategic risk 
63
management decisions to retain additional risk in certain markets, and (ii) an increase in insurance-related accruals. There was also an increase in certain loss contingencies, including legal accruals. These were partially offset by (i) increases to prepaid expenses for cash outflows related to our insurance activities, including insurance premium payments and (ii) 
ordinary payments for our real estate operating leases.
 The timing of our scheduled driver payments also impacted prepaid and other current assets and accrued liabilities.
Cash used in operating activities was $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consisted of a net loss of $340.3 million (which has a positive contribution to cash for the year as it was impacted by significant non-cash items, such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensations) which was primarily offset by changes in working capital of $(278.3) million. The year over year decrease in net loss from $1.6 billion to $340.3 million was a result of an increase in our revenue and the actions we have taken to reduce our operating expenses. Net loss was also offset by non-cash adjustments for stock-based compensation expense of $484.5 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $116.5 million. The changes in working capital were primarily driven by insurance, which saw (i) an increase in cash paid related to prepaid expenses and other assets driven by increases in premiums year over year due to higher rates and increased ride volumes, (ii) a decrease in our insurance reserves as insurance payments outpaced accruals in the period and (iii) an increase in our cash outflow related to accounts payable due to the timing of insurance claims payments. There was also an increase in our cash outflow related to accrued and other liabilities primarily due to settlement of historical legal and tax related liabilities. 
Investing Activities 
Cash used in investing activities was $518.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $4.2 billion and purchases of property and equipment of $83.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $3.6 billion and the sale of property and equipment of $92.0 million.
Cash provided by investing activities was $599.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $3.9 billion and the sale of property and equipment of $92.6 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $3.3 billion and purchases of property and equipment of $149.8 million.
Financing Activities 
Cash used in financing activities was $155.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This included a net cash inflow of $0.2 million for transactions related to the issuance of our 2029 Notes which included $460.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes and expenditures of $350.0 million related to the settlement of the 2025 Notes, $50.0 million related to the repurchase of Class A common stock, $47.9 million related to the purchase of capped calls and $11.9 million in payments of debt issuance costs. Additionally, our financing activities included a repayment of loans of $84.1 million, principal payments on finance lease obligations of $46.7 million and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $40.3 million. 
Cash used in financing activities was $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of repayment of loans of $72.5 million and principal payments on finance lease obligations for $43.5 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of approximately $759.3 million and short-term investments of approximately $1.2 billion, exclusive of restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.5 billion, and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $420.0 million as described below. The portion of our cash and cash equivalents that is not invested is held at several large financial institutions and our investments are focused on the preservation of capital, fulfillment of our liquidity needs, and maximization of investment performance within the parameters set forth in our investment policy and subject to market conditions. The investment policy sets forth credit rating minimums, permissible allocations, and limits our exposure to specific investment types. We believe these policies mitigate our exposure to any risk concentrations.
On November 3, 2022, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with certain lenders which provides for a $420 million senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended to date, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) maturing on November 3, 2027 or February 13, 2025, if, as of February 13, 2025, our Liquidity (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) minus the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes outstanding on such date is less than $1.25 billion. We are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an unused commitment fee. The interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility is determined based on calculations using certain market rates as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on payments such as cash payments of dividends. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility, with a sublimit of $168 million for the issuance of letters of credit. We entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Credit Agreement on December 12, 2023 and Amendment No. 2 on February 21, 2024 and such amendments amended the existing agreement to, among other things: (a) solely for the purposes of the financial covenant test, replace total leverage with total net leverage, which allows us to subtract the lesser of (i)(x) to the extent free cash flow for the most recently ended trailing four quarters is greater than $100.0 million, $300.0 million and (y) otherwise, $200.0 million and (ii) the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the Amended Agreement) on our consolidated balance sheets as of the calculation date and (b) permit us to 
64
repurchase up to a specified amount of our common stock with the proceeds of a convertible note offering. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain customary events of default.
In February 2024, we completed an offering of $460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used (1) approximately $350 million of the net proceeds to repurchase approximately $356.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes in separate and privately negotiated transactions entered into concurrently with the pricing of the offering with certain holders of the 2025 Notes effected through one of the initial purchasers of the 2029 Notes or its affiliate, acting as our agent, (2) approximately $47.9 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the 2029 Capped Calls and (3) approximately $50 million of the net proceeds to purchase Class A common stock from institutional investors through one of the initial purchasers of the 2029 Notes or its affiliate, acting as Lyft’s agent, at a price per share equal to the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of the pricing of the 2029 Notes. Refer to Note 11 “Debt” and Note 12 "Common Stock and Employee Stock Plans" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these transactions.
We collect the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers at the time the ride is delivered using the rider’s authorized payment method, and we retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers. Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our contracts with insurance providers require reinsurance premiums to be deposited into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which the insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $1.4 billion and $837.3 million, respectively. 
We have $2.0 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2024. We also have the ability to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $420.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, none of which has been drawn as of December 31, 2024, and $72.6 million in letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024. We believe that this provides sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital, 
inclusive of short-term commitments such as the current portion of our convertible senior notes which we plan to settle with cash in early 2025, and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we achieved annual net income for the first time in our operating history. We plan to continue to focus on and actively manage our cash balances and liquidity, capital expenditures, working capital and operating expenses. In particular, we continue to actively monitor the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, including tightening credit markets, inflation and changing interest rates and have made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow which include headcount reductions announced in the third quarter of 2024, second quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022. We have also incurred restructuring charges related to the exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with our anticipated operating needs in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Refer to Note 15 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these reductions in workforce. 
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, the effectiveness of our efforts to align our expenses with our current operating needs and short-term commitments, our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, actual insurance payments for which we have made reserves, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as satisfaction of our obligations with respect to any indebtedness. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies. For example, we intend to invest further in EVs in order to achieve compliance with the California Clean Miles Standard which sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030; the Massachusetts’ Climate Bill; New York City's goal to get to 100% of rideshare rides in EVs or wheelchair accessible vehicles by 2030, and the City of Toronto’s push to bring the industry to 100% electric by 2030. In addition, in February 2025, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our Class A common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Refer to Note 17 “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this repurchase program. From time to time, we have and we may in the future seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to refinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. The terms of any additional financings or refinancings may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
We believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue Recognition 
Revenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)
We generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers enter into terms of service (“ToS”) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App. 
We provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders. 
We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to the rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to a rider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to provide a transportation service to their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services, the drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. 
We report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip. 
66
We consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment. 
We earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amount earned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-front quoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver. 
We recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the services rendered upon the completion of the ride. 
We offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received. 
In some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to request rides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of the ride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis. 
We recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over the applicable subscription period.
We also recognize revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales when control is transferred to the customer. These revenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue. 
We generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access to Flexdrive vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. We act as a principal in delivering the data and access licenses and present revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, are determined by assigning the relative fair value, which represents the stand alone selling price, to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as our respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each. Revenue was recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data until expiration of the rideshare contract in the second quarter of 2024. These revenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue. 
We have arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of our platform. These arrangements generally require us to provide advertising services over a fixed period of time for which revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period. These revenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue. 
Rental Revenue (ASC 842)
We generate rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, an independently managed subsidiary, and our network of Light Vehicles. Under the Flexdrive program, we operate a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles to drivers and as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform. 
Revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light Vehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.
Insurance Reserves and Insurance-related Accruals
We utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors for the insurance reserves and frequency and severity 
67
assumptions for the insurance-related accruals, among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.
Insurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant assumptions related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to insurance-related accruals, and utilize actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while we believe that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts are adequate, the ultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liabilities and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets. We continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. 
Business Combinations
We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.
Loss Contingencies
We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory and governmental inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business. Certain matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.
The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For matters where the Company has recorded a probable and estimable loss, until the final resolution of the matter, there may be exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded. 
Income Taxes
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss 
68
carryforwards. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more-likely-than-not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized. However, based on our current and anticipated future earnings, our management believes it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence of sustained U.S. profitability may become available in the foreseeable future to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on the level of profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve. A release of all or a portion of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded. 
In recognizing tax benefits from uncertain tax `positions, the Company assesses whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits. Evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and requires judgement and use of assumptions and estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
See 
Note 2
 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recent accounting pronouncements as of the date of this report. 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange. Such fluctuations to date have not been significant. 
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $2.0 billion, which consisted primarily of institutional money market funds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and term deposits, which each carry a degree of interest rate risk, and restricted cash, cash equivalents and restricted investments of $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we had long-term debt of $995.0 million, 39% of which consisted of the fixed-rate 2025 Notes we issued in May 2020, and 45% of which consisted of the fixed-rate 2029 Notes we issued in February 2024. A hypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lyft, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lyft, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2022.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
71
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of Insurance Reserves and Insurance-Related Accruals
As described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. As of December 31, 2024, insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals totaled $1,701.4 million and $763.8 million, respectively. These liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends and changes in claims experience. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant assumption related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to the insurance-related accruals, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the estimated insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial valuation techniques and management’s significant assumptions related to loss development factors for the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance related accruals; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals, including the controls over the development of the actuarial valuation techniques and the assumptions related to loss development factors for the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance-related accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of historical data provided by management and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimates by (a) developing independent estimates of certain insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals and comparing these independent estimates to management’s actuarially determined reserves; (b) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial techniques; (c) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions by independently developing loss development factors for the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance-related accruals based on loss reporting and payment experience and historical trends; and (d) evaluating the consistency of management’s actuarial techniques period-over-period.

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Organization and Description of Business
Lyft, Inc. (the “Company” or “Lyft”) is incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Company operates multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications. This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle with riders who need a ride. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a transportation network company (“TNC”). 
Transportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders in cities across the United States and in certain cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”), and the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive Services, LLC (“Flexdrive”) or a third party for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. In addition, the Company makes the ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft Pass programs, and generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements associated with the data from the Company's platform, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience, expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims inclusive of insurance-related accruals, fair value of financial assets and liabilities, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, leases, indirect tax obligations, legal contingencies, valuation allowance for deferred income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based compensation.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Segment Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as 
one
 operating segment. The Company has concluded that consolidated net income (loss) is the measure of segment profitability. The CODM assesses performance for the Company, monitors budget versus actual results, and determines how to allocate resources based on consolidated net income (loss) as reported in the consolidated statements of operations. There are no other expense categories regularly provided to the CODM that are not already included in the primary financial statements herein.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have material assets located outside of the United States.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporate bonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 
79
days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Also included in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Restricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposes and amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.
Investments
Debt Securities 
The Company’s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company’s intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government and agency securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.
The Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The entire difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of operations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the Company's assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is measured based on the Company's best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected. When developing its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Credit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheet with an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method.
The Company's investments in debt securities include:
(i)
Cash and cash equivalents. 
Cash equivalents include certificates of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an original maturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. 
(ii)
Short-term investments.
 Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which mature in twelve months or less. As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
(iii)
Restricted investments. 
Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government and agency securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers.
Non-marketable Equity Securities
The Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, and macroeconomic conditions, among others. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment by using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.
Enterprise and Trade Receivables
The Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method. Uncollected fees are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and represent receivables from (i) participants in the Company’s enterprise programs (“Enterprise Users”), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled as of the reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled with third-party payment 
80
processors. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers is included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses”. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise and trade receivables balance. In determining the expected credit losses, the Company considers its historical loss experience, the aging of its receivable balance, current economic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:
Level 1
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2
Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3
Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.
The carrying values of the Company’s debt securities, accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time to payment.
Software Development Costs
The Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the Lyft Platform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.
 The Company has capitalized software development costs of $
4.2
 million, $
8.1
 million, and $
12.1
 million as of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset, which is generally between 
one
 and 
eight years
. Depreciation for property and equipment commences once they are ready for our intended use. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in the period realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets. Construction in progress is related to property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.
Leases
In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. The Company determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leases or subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain 
81
agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, the Company classifies the lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):
•
The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;
•
The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;
•
The lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the economic life of the underlying asset;
•
The present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or
•
The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.
Leases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases. 
Lessor
The Company's lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive program and Light Vehicle rentals to single-use riders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized as revenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with each lease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigates residual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on the Company's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.
Lessee
The Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use asset and lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected to do so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.
The Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the Company's operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of finance leases is included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognized primarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
Similar to other long-lived assets discussed below, the Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the decision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the associated lease.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management’s estimate of the fair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from 
two
 to 
twelve years
.
82
Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.
 There was 
no
 impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. The Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
 With the exception of impairment charges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets discussed in Note 9 “Leases” and disposals of fixed assets and other current assets discussed in Note 15 “Restructuring”, there was 
no
 other material impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
Insurance Reserves and Insurance-related Accruals
The Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, and changes in claims experience, including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors, and frequency and severity assumptions, among other inputs and assumptions for the insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.
Insurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has available limited historical loss experience because of the limited operational history. The Company makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant assumption related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to insurance-related accruals, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts are adequate, the ultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liabilities and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for on the consolidated balance sheets. For example, disruptive factors may distort data, metrics and patterns and result in rapid increases in insurance cost and reserve deficiency. These disruptive factors can include recent economic conditions and ongoing global events such as the high inflationary environment, increased litigation, and higher than expected losses across the commercial auto industry. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.
Foreign Currency
The Company uses the U.S. dollar predominantly as the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries. For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of operations. For the foreign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications. Substantially all, or approximately 
85
% or more, of the Company’s revenue is generated from its ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognized in accordance 
83
with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensing and data access, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties, which are not significant components of the Company’s consolidated revenues. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles, which is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (“ASC 842”). 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)
The Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions (collectively, “fees”) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a TNC. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each ride. Drivers enter into terms of service (“ToS”) with the Company in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider. 
As the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion of the ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.
The Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over the applicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from bikes, bike station hardware and software sales when control is transferred to the customer in accordance with ASC 606. 
The Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide rideshare data and access to Flexdrive vehicles and bears the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. The Company is acting as a principal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value, which represents the stand alone selling price, to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company’s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each. Revenue was recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data until expiration of the rideshare performance obligation in the second quarter of 2024. These revenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue. 
The Company has arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of the Company’s platform. These arrangements generally require the Company to provide advertising services over a fixed period of time for which revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period. These revenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue. 
Rental Revenue (ASC 842)
The Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles. Rental revenues are recognized for rental and rental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842. 
The Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. The Company either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs, as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.
The Company owns and operates its Light Vehicles in some cities and operates city-owned Light Vehicles in other cities. Though the specific terms of arrangements with cities vary, the Company earns operations fees from cities or shares revenue generated by the systems with cities. Light Vehicle revenue is accounted for under ASC 842 for single-use rides. A single-use ride allows the user to select a specific Light Vehicle at the time the arrangement is entered into and provides the user the right to control the selected Light Vehicle for the desired term of the arrangement. 
84
Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. 
Incentive Programs
The Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders and Light Vehicle riders to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cash incentives while riders and Light Vehicle riders generally receive free or discounted rides under such incentive programs. Incentives provided to drivers and Light Vehicle riders, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not the Company’s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.
Driver Incentives
The Company offers various incentive programs to drivers, including minimum guaranteed payments, volume-based discounts and performance-based bonus payments. These driver incentives are similar to retrospective volume-based rebates and represent variable consideration that is typically settled within a week. The Company reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the most likely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Company does not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or the established fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.
Rideshare Rider Incentives
The Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentive programs are as follows:
(i)
Market-wide marketing promotions.
 Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market. This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by the driver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction to revenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.
(ii)
Targeted marketing promotions.
 Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example is a promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of time to a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides are similar to marketing coupons. These incentives differ from the market-wide marketing promotions because they do not reduce the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for a specific market. During the promotion period, riders not utilizing an incentive would be charged the full fare. These incentives represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of the incentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.
(iii)
Rider referral programs.
 Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral incentives when a new rider (the referee) completes their first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Referral incentives typically expire within one year. The Company estimates breakage using its historical experience. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the rider referral incentives liability was not material.
Light Vehicle Rider Incentives
Incentives offered to Light Vehicle riders were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, in relation to the driver, rider and Light Vehicle riders incentive programs, the Company recorded $
777.4
 million, $
1.1
 billion and $
1.4
 billion as a reduction to revenue and $
423.2
 million, $
142.5
 million and $
109.8
 million as sales and marketing expense, respectively.
Refunds
From time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to riders unsatisfied by the level of service provided by the driver. There is no legal obligation to remunerate such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or refunds, which are not recoverable from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, rider refunds were $
13.3
 million, $
19.7
 million and $
21.5

85
million, respectively. The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as cost of revenue and was $
4.1
 million, $
6.2
 million and $
7.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through the Company’s multimodal platform which primarily includes insurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing and bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, vehicle lease expenses, personnel-related compensation costs, depreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.
Operations and Support
Operations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email and chat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental fleet support costs, and fees paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related to the Company’s autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders, advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.
 Advertising expenses were $
136.9
 million, $
122.0
 million and $
162.1
 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that are generally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative fees, policy spend, depreciation, facility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company incurs stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), stock options, and the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) purchase rights.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model incorporates various assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates.
The Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” stock option awards. The expected term of the ESPP purchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. The Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchase rights using the historical volatility of the stock price of the Company and similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted. 
The fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.
The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.
Compensation expense for RSUs is generally recognized based on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and compensation expense for PSUs is generally recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each individual tranche. Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated 
86
forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.
401(k) Plan
The Company adopted a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the IRC. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not currently make contributions for employees.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
Under the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions taken by the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company follows the two-class method when computing net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company had no participating securities outstanding during any of the periods presented. 
Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
Variable Interest Entities
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, 
Consolidation
 (“ASC 810”), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. For 
87
an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated financial statements.
The Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of 
one
 VIE as of December 31, 2024.

Acquisitions
Acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc. (“PBSC”)
On May 17, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of 
100
% of the outstanding equity of PBSC, a global leader in bikeshare that supplies stations and bikes to markets internationally, for a total purchase price of $
163.5
 million inclusive of $
14.1
 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The acquisition was treated as a business combination and increases the Company’s scale in micromobility by leveraging PBSC’s deep sales experience and customer relationships. 
Acquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
During the second quarter of 2023, the Company paid out earn out incentives of $
15.0
 million, which were previously included in contingent consideration on the consolidated balance sheet. The earn out incentives were based on hardware and software for new system sales, either earned or committed during the earn out period.

The Company concluded the purchase accounting for the acquisition of PBSC during the second quarter of 2023. During the measurement period, the Company recorded immaterial purchase price adjustments resulting in a decrease in goodwill.
The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 on April 1, 2022, prior to the acquisition of PBSC, the Company's only acquisition in 2022. Upon the adoption of this update, contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination are recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606 as if the acquirer had originated the contracts, which would generally result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquiree’s financial statements. Therefore, PBSC’s historical deferred revenue balance as of May 17, 2022 has been included in the purchase price allocation in accordance with ASU 2021-08
.
The goodwill is attributable to (i) expanded sales opportunities for the Company's current products and services by leveraging PBSC's assembled workforce and (ii) cost synergies associated with economies of scale and a streamlined supply chain as the combined businesses operate on a global scale. The acquisition is a non-taxable business combination and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

The fair value of the tradename was determined to be $
1.0
 million with an estimated useful life of 
two years
. The fair value of the tradename was determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes and discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. 
The fair value of the customer relationships – cities was determined to be $
22.2
 million with estimated useful lives between 
seven
 and 
eleven years
. The fair value of the customer relationships – cities was determined using the multi-period excess earnings. The multi-period excess earnings approach involves forecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset, reducing them by appropriate returns on contributory assets, and then discounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. 
The fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $
21.9
 million with an estimated useful life between 
two
 and 
three years
. The fair value of the developed technology was determined using the replacement cost approach. In the replacement cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the cost of a market participant to reconstruct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for any obsolescence. The fair value of the asset would include the expected profit margin a hypothetical third party developer would charge and a market participant buyer's opportunity costs lost over the period to reconstruct the substitute asset. 
Judgment was applied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets, including revenue and cash flow forecasts, technology life, royalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate. 
Refer to Note 16 
“
Variable Interest Entities” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the variable interest entities included in this transaction.
The results of operations for the acquired business have been included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company's acquisition of PBSC. PBSC’s results of operations for periods prior to this acquisition were not material to the consolidated statements of operations and, accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.

The Company’s short-term investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities and term deposits. The term deposits are at cost, which approximates fair value.
The remaining maturity of the Company’s investment portfolio was less than one year as of the periods presented. No individual security incurred continuous unrealized losses for greater than 12 months.
The Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in accordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses. As of December 31, 2024, the credit-quality of the Company’s marketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2024 were primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with uncertain economic outlook. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its quarterly assessment of credit losses for any marketable available-for-sale debt security as of December 31, 2024. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized on the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. 
No
 credit losses were recognized as of December 31, 2024 for the Company’s marketable and non-marketable debt securities.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid out earn out incentives of $

 million related to the acquisition of PBSC. The contingent consideration was classified as a liability and was included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4 "Acquisitions" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this contingent consideration.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values and the carrying value of these non-marketable equity securities are remeasured to fair value based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. 
In June 2021 and June 2022, the Company received investments in a non-marketable equity security in a privately held company without a readily determinable market value as part of licensing and data access agreements. The investment had an initial carrying value of $
128.1
 million as of June 30, 2022 which was categorized as Level 3. The Company did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over this privately-held company and had elected to measure this investment as a non-marketable equity security and classified it in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet. The entire amount of the investment in the non-marketable equity security was impaired due to the announced winding down of the equity investee in October 2022. In addition to the impairment of this non-marketable equity security, an other asset was impaired, resulting in a total impairment of $
135.7
 million recorded to other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.
In February 2022, the issuer of the Company's $
10.0
 million investment in non-marketable equity securities in a privately held company was acquired by a publicly-traded company. As a result of the acquisition in exchange for the securities in the privately-held entity, the Company received common stock of a publicly-traded entity with a value of $
8.4
 million upon receipt, with the remainder to be received in cash. These shares are classified as marketable equity securities and measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The shares are categorized as Level 1 and changes in fair value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. In March 2022, the Company sold its shares resulting in a recognized loss recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
There were $
9.1
 million and $
5.9
 million of financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within other investments on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liability Insurance
On April 22, 2021, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (“PVIC”), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the “Reinsurance Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $
183.2
 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $
251.3
 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $
434.5
 million, for a premium of $
271.5
 million (“the Reinsurance Transaction”). The Reinsurance Agreement was on a funds withheld basis, meaning that funds are withheld by PVIC from the insurance premium owed to DARAG in order to pay future reinsurance claims on DARAG’s behalf. Upon consummation of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $
251.3
 million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurance recoverable was netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $
271.5
 million for a $
20.2
 million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $
271.5
 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insurance liabilities was collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $
75.0
 million upon consummation. At the inception of the Reinsurance Agreement, a loss of approximately $
20.4
 million for the total cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement of 
95
operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $
20.2
 million in cost of revenue and $
0.2
 million in general and administrative expenses.
Commutation of the Reinsurance Agreement
On June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG entered into a Commutation Agreement, which effectively commuted and settled the previous Reinsurance Agreement. Under the terms of the Commutation Agreement, DARAG released $
89.3
 million of assets held in trust to PVIC and the remaining balance of the funds withheld liability of $
90.3
 million from the Reinsurance Transaction for a total consideration of $
178.6
 million. 
In addition, the Commutation Agreement caused a DARAG affiliate, DNA Insurance Company (“DNA”), to simultaneously enter into an Adverse Development Cover Reinsurance Agreement (“ADC”) with PVIC (the Commutation Agreement and the ADC collectively referred to as the “Commutation Transaction”). Under the terms of the ADC, DNA agreed to reinsure up to $
20
 million of the legacy insurance liabilities contemplated in the Reinsurance Agreement for a premium of $
1.0
 million, which would be retained by PVIC on a funds withheld basis. DNA also had the option to commute this agreement for $
5.0
 million prior to November 1, 2023, which would be offset by any premiums retained as funds withheld.
As a result of the Commutation Transaction, the Company noted the following impacts on its financial statements:
•
The Company recognized a $
36.8
 million gain in cost of revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2022, including amortization of a portion of the previously recognized deferred gain.
•
The Company reduced its reinsurance recoverable by $
247.4
 million and the funds withheld liability balance by $
90.3
 million.
•
The Company amortized deferred gains related to losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement by $
105.7
 million. 
On February 8, 2023, PVIC and DNA entered into a Commutation and Mutual Release Agreement, whereby DNA agreed to exercise its option to fully settle and commute the ADC. DNA commuted the ADC for $
5.0
 million consisting of a $
4.0
 million payment made to PVIC and the release of $
1.0
 million premium which was retained by PVIC as funds withheld. As a result, PVIC recognized a gain of $
3.4
 million, comprised of $
2.4
 million amortization of the remaining deferred gain and $
1.0
 million related to the release of the funds withheld. PVIC also reduced its reinsurance recoverable by $
4.0
 million related to the payment received.

Leases
Real Estate Operating Leases

The Company leases real estate property at approximately 
59
 locations as of December 31, 2024. These leases are classified as operating leases. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining lease terms vary from approximately 
one month
 to 
ten years
. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the lease term for periods varying from 
one month
 to 
ten years
. These renewal options are 
96
not considered in the remaining lease term unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representing the fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by the landlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company amended the lease for its San Francisco headquarters, to terminate certain suites and extend the term of other suites to 2034. As a result of terminating certain suites, a $
29.6
 million gain was recognized within general and administrative expenses as the right-of-use asset associated with a portion of this lease was previously impaired in 2022 and 2023 as part of restructuring, and the extinguishment of the remaining lease liability resulted in the recorded gain.
Flexdrive Program
The Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies. These leases are classified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining lease terms vary between 
one month
 to 
four years
. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such, all payments due under these arrangements are allocated to the respective lease component.

Commitments and Contingencies
Noncancellable Purchase Commitments
The Company entered into a noncancellable arrangement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), a web-hosting services provider, under which the Company had an obligation to purchase a minimum amount of services from this vendor. Under the most recent amended arrangement, the Company committed to spend an aggregate of at least $
350
 million between February 2022 and January 2026, with a minimum amount of $
80
 million in each of the four contractual periods, on services with AWS. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has made payments of $
350.6
 million under the amended arrangement. 
In May 2019, the Company entered into a noncancellable arrangement with the City of Chicago, with respect to the Divvy bike share program, under which the Company has an obligation to pay approximately $
7.5
 million per year to the City of Chicago through January 2028 and to spend a minimum of $
50
 million on capital equipment for the bike share program through January 2028. The parties modified the commitment amounts and timing in April 2023 to reduce the Company’s payment obligation by $
12
 million and to supply a maximum of $
12
 million on capital equipment for the bike share program through 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has made payments totaling $
33.6
 million and capital equipment investments totaling $

Letters of Credit
The Company maintains certain stand-by letters of credit from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business to guarantee certain performance obligations related to leases, insurance policies and other various contractual arrangements. 
None
 of the outstanding letters of credit are collateralized by cash. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $
72.6
 million and $
60.2
 million, respectively.
99
Indemnification
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business partners, investors, contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. The Company has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party’s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claims because of the Company’s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been material.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory and governmental inquiries and investigations, and in some situations has received subpoenas and requests for documents and information, in the ordinary course of business, including drivers, riders, renters, third parties and governmental entities (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage and expense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company’s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicable law, or that the Company has not acted in conformity with such fees, rules or policies, as well as proceedings related to product liability, antitrust, competition, its acquisitions, securities issuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the Company or the Company's business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigation matters related to allegations of accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform. 
The outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For certain matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor is the Company able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. For matters where the Company has recorded a probable and estimable loss, until the final resolution of the matter, there may be exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded. 
Independent Contractor Classification Matters
With regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of these drivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driver employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company. 
For example, California Assembly Bill 5 (now codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2775) codified and extended an employment classification test set forth by the California Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors in violation of Assembly Bill 5 and California’s Unfair Competition Law, and on August 5, 2020, the California Labor Commissioner filed lawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive relief and material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. On April 20, 2021, the court granted the parties’ joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 5, 2021, the California Labor Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordination petition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On December 19, 2022, the California Attorney General’s and California Labor Commissioner’s cases were stayed in San Francisco Superior Court pending the appeal of a Superior Court order denying Lyft’s and Uber’s motions to compel arbitration. On September 28, 2023, the California Court of Appeal issued a decision upholding the trial court’s order denying Lyft’s and Uber’s motions to compel arbitration. On November 7, 2023, the Company filed a petition requesting that the California Supreme Court review the Court of Appeal’s decision; the petition was denied on January 17, 2024, and the case was remitted to San Francisco Superior Court on January 29, 2024. The stay was lifted by the trial court on July 2, 2024, and the parties are exploring mediation. On October 7, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the Company's petition for writ of certiorari. 
In 2021, a group of petitioners led by labor union SEIU filed a separate lawsuit in a California court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services 
100
(PADS) — the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 — intervened in the lawsuit. In August 2021, the trial court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable, but in March 2023, the California Court of Appeal reversed that decision and upheld Proposition 22, while severing two provisions that relate to future amendments of the measure. On July 25, 2024, the California Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal and unanimously upheld Proposition 22. 
Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including damages, penalties and potential suspension of operations in impacted jurisdictions, including California. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another. 
Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Trial took place from May 13, 2024 to June 3, 2024. On June 27, 2024, the parties reached a resolution to dismiss the litigation with prejudice and Massachusetts drivers have begun receiving new benefits and maintained their flexibility as independent contractors. The amount accrued for these matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. 
The Company is currently involved in a number of putative class actions, thousands of individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to the Company's Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California’s Private Attorneys General Act, Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging the classification of drivers on the Company’s platform as independent contractors. The Company is also defending against allegations that the Company has failed to properly classify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.
The Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. However, results of litigation, arbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
Unemployment Insurance Assessment
The Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Company believes that drivers are properly classified as independent contractors and plans to vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The Company accrues for liabilities that may result from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses. 
In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through March 31, 2018. The NJDOL issued an assessment on June 4, 2019 and subsequently issued an updated assessment on March 31, 2021. On August 2, 2024, the NJDOL issued a revised assessment, which is based upon a different methodology. The assessment was calculated through April 30, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2017. The Company filed a petition to challenge the assessment, and is awaiting a hearing. The Company has also submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment to stop interest from accruing on this amount. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company recorded an accrual for this matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
In 2021, the New York State Department of Labor (“NYSDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply for 2019. The NYSDOL subsequently extended the audit back to 2016. On December 22, 2022, the Company received an assessment for the 2016 to 2019 time period and on December 27, 2023, the Company received a revised assessment covering 2016 to 2020. The Company has appealed these assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company recorded an accrual for this matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
In June 2022, the California Employment Development Department ("EDD") opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2018 to 2020. The EDD issued an assessment on June 9, 2023 and subsequently issued an updated assessment on June 27, 2023. The Company filed a petition to challenge the assessment, and is in discussions with the EDD regarding resolution. While the ultimate 
101
resolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company recorded an accrual for this matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
Indirect Taxes
The Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises from disputes on tax treatment and tax rates applied to the sale of the Company’s services in these jurisdictions. The Company accrues indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.
The Company is currently engaged in an ongoing dispute with the City and County of San Francisco (“San Francisco”) regarding the application of gross receipts taxes to rideshare. On December 20, 2024, the Company filed suit against San Francisco and San Francisco’s Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector seeking refund of approximately $
100
 million in payroll expense tax, gross receipts tax, homelessness gross receipts tax, penalties, and interest for the 2019 through 2023 tax years. The outcome of this matter is uncertain. 
Patent Litigation
The Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to sell or license such property and/or asserting infringement of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.
Other Class Actions and Consumer Matters
From time to time, the Company becomes involved in putative class actions, investigations, and other matters alleging violations of consumer protection, civil rights, and other laws; antitrust and unfair competition laws such as California’s Cartwright Act, Unfair Practices Act and Unfair Competition Law; and the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, among others. In July 2024, the Company went to trial in federal court in New York to defend against a class action alleging ADA and New York law violations with respect to the Company's wheelchair accessible vehicle ("WAV") offerings, seeking injunctive and other relief, in 
Lowell v. Lyft, Inc.
 On September 30, 2024, the district court ruled that plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proof that the modifications they proposed at trial would result in nationwide WAV service. The district court dismissed the suit and entered judgment in favor of the Company. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on October 29, 2024, and the appeal is now pending before the Second Circuit Court of Appeal. The Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) alleged violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act in connection with certain advertising claims to drivers. The Company reached a settlement with the government to resolve this matter, which was approved by a court on November 1, 2024.
Personal Injury and Other Safety Matters
In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders or renters using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as well as from third parties. The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders, renters and third parties. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses, disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. There is no pending or threatened claim that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company’s opinion, is likely to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating to alleged sexual assault or harassment by drivers on the Lyft Platform, and a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding has been created before the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, where the claims of multiple plaintiffs are currently pending. Other legal proceedings related to accidents, alleged sexual assault or harassment, or other safety incidents are pending in various jurisdictions and may similarly proceed to trial or final adjudication. Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors. Although the Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages of litigation and present a wide range of potential outcomes. The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
102
Securities Litigation
Beginning in April 2019, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts against the Company, its directors, certain of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the registration statement relating to the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the IPO. All of these matters are now resolved except for the derivative actions, which were consolidated into one action in federal court in California. A proposed settlement was filed in the derivative action on July 23, 2024, and the court granted preliminary approval on October 16, 2024. A hearing on final settlement approval was held on February 6, 2025, and the matter remains pending before the court.
On February 13, 2024, the Company published a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 that was furnished with our Current Report on Form 8-K filed that same day. The press release contained a clerical error relating to the Company's forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for fiscal year 2024 (the “Clerical Error”). The Clerical Error was promptly corrected on the Company's earnings call and in an updated press release, and the Company filed an amended 8-K. Shortly after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requested information relating to the Clerical Error. The Company cooperated and responded voluntarily to the requests. On September 5, 2024, the SEC informed the Company that it had concluded its investigation and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company.
On March 5, 2024, a putative class action, captioned 
Chen v. Lyft, Inc., et al.
, was filed against the Company, our principal executive officer, and principal financial officer, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The putative class action alleges violations of the federal securities laws relating to the Clerical Error. On September 13, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. After a hearing on January 14, 2025, the court entered an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice on January 16, 2025. The plaintiff had until February 6, 2025 to file an amended complaint but did not do so. 
Although the Company believes the consolidated derivative action and putative class action are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and these matters present a wide range of potential outcomes. The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and such accruals are recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Convertible Senior Notes due 2025
In May 2020, the Company issued $
747.5
 million aggregate principal amount of 
1.50
% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) pursuant to an indenture, dated May 15, 2020 (the “Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association), as trustee. 
 The 2025 Notes mature on May 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company with interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020, at a rate of 
1.50
% per year. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $
733.2
 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs. 
The initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 26.0491 shares of the Company's Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
38.39
 per share of the Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2025 Note Indenture.
The 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: 
•
during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock, for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 
•
during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the 2025 Note Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 
•
if the Company calls such 2025 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. 
None of these conditions were met prior to February 15, 2025.
On or after February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2025 Note Indenture. 
Holders of the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2025 Note Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the 2025 Note Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
In February 2024, the Company, through privately negotiated agreements in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes (as defined below), repurchased approximately $
356.8
 million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $
350.0
 million. The Company recognized this repurchase as an extinguishment of debt and recorded a gain on extinguishment of $
5.1
 million in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, the Company determined the fair value of the liability component to be $
558.3
 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the borrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $
189.2
 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the liability component (“debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense over the contractual term at an effective interest rate of 
8.0
%.
Following the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the Company no longer bifurcates the 2025 Notes, but rather accounts for the conversion feature as a single debt instrument. The difference between the carrying amount and face value of the liability results in a reduced liability component. Therefore, less interest expense is being recorded each period from January 1, 2022 to maturity and the equity component is now classified as debt, eliminating the subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $
140.0
 million, net of tax, 
104
to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the 2025 Notes and equity component associated with the issuance costs, an increase of approximately $
133.5
 million in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes to reflect the full principal amount, net of issuance costs, and an increase to accumulated deficit of approximately $
6.5
 million, net of tax in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with no impact to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
Debt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $
14.3
 million at inception and were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the initial purchasers and third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of December 31, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the 2025 Notes was $
0.5
 million on the consolidated balance sheets. The effective interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
1.9
%. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the 2025 Notes did not meet any of the circumstances that would allow for a conversion.
Based on the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock on December 31, 2024, the if-converted value of the 2025 Notes was $
131.3
 million, which would not exceed the outstanding principal amount.
Convertible Senior Notes due 2029
In February 2024, the Company issued $
460.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
0.625
% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the "2029 Notes" together with the 2025 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an indenture, dated February 27, 2024 (the “2029 Notes Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee.
The 2029 Notes mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company with interest payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024, at a rate of 
0.625
% per year. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $
448.2
 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs. The 2029 Notes were not issued at a substantial premium, therefore, the Company did not recognize an equity component at issuance.
The initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes is 47.4366 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
21.08
 per share of the Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2029 Notes Indenture.
The 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 1, 2028 only under the following circumstances:
•
during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock, for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;
•
during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the 2029 Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;
•
if the Company calls such 2029 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. 
On or after December 1, 2028, the 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be converted and by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2029 Notes Indenture.
Holders of the 2029 Notes who convert their 2029 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Notes Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Notes Indenture), holders of the 2029 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2029 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
105
Debt issuance costs related to the 2029 Notes totaled $
11.8
 million at inception and were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the initial purchasers and third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of December 31, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the 2029 Notes was $
9.9
 million on the consolidated balance sheets. The effective interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
1.16
%. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the 2029 Notes did not meet any of the circumstances that would allow for a conversion.
Based on the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock on December 31, 2024, the if-converted value of the 2029 Notes was $
281.5
 million, which would not exceed the outstanding principal amount.

As of December 31, 2024, the total estimated fair values (which represents a Level 2 valuation) of the 2025 Notes and the 2029 Notes were approximately $
385.5
 million and $
440.9
 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the Notes were determined based on a market approach which was determined based on the actual bids and offers of the Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the period.
The Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants, restrictions on dividends, incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or restrictions on the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.
Capped Calls
In connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “2025 Capped Calls”) with certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates at a cost of approximately $
132.7
 million. The 2025 Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the 2025 Notes sold in the offering. By entering into the 2025 Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2025 Notes. The cap price of the 2025 Capped Calls is initially $
73.83
 per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2025 Capped Calls.
In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “2029 Capped Calls” and together with the 2025 Capped Calls, the “Capped Calls”) with certain financial institutions at a cost of approximately $
47.9
 million. The 2029 Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the 2029 Notes sold in the offering. By entering into the 2029 Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2029 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2029 Notes the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2029 Notes. The cap price of the 2029 Capped Calls is initially $
31.82
 per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 2029 Capped Calls.
The 2025 Capped Calls and the 2029 Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not remeasured each reporting period and included as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital within shareholders’ equity.
Non-revolving Loan
Following the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security Agreement dated March 11, 2019, as amended (the “Non-revolving Loan”) with a third-party lender. On September 12, 2024, the Non-revolving Loan was amended, extending the Company's ability to draw through September 30, 2025. As amended to date, the Non-revolving Loan provides for a borrowing capacity of $
50.0
 million, though Flexdrive may request an extension of credit in the form of advances up to a maximum principal amount of $
130
 million to purchase new Hyundai 
106
and Kia vehicles, or for other purposes, subject to approval by the lender. Advances paid or prepaid under the Non-revolving Loan may not be reborrowed. Repayment terms for each advance include equal monthly installments sufficient to fully amortize the advances over the term, with an option for the final installment to be greater than the others. The repayment term for each advance ranges from 
24
 months to 
48
 months. Interest is payable monthly in arrears at a fixed interest rate equal to the two-year U.S. Treasury note yield plus a spread of 
3.4
% for a 
24-month
 term, the three-year U.S. Treasury note yield plus a spread of 
3.4
% for a 
36
 month term, and the average of the three and five-year U.S. Treasury note yields plus a spread of 
3.4
% for a 
48
 month term. The Non-revolving Loan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Non-revolving Loan. As December 31, 2024, a total of $
5.2
 million had been drawn under the Non-revolving Loan and $
44.8
 million is remaining under the facility.
The Non-revolving Loan also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to Flexdrive or the Company, all amounts due under the Non-revolving Loan may become immediately due and payable, among other remedies. 
As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Non-revolving Loan in all material aspects.

Further, the Company continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed.
Master Vehicle Loan
Following the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Master Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, dated February 7, 2020 as amended (the “Master Vehicle Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to the term of the Master Vehicle Loan, Flexdrive may request loans up to a maximum principal amount of $
50
 million to purchase vehicles and additional capacity may be requested. Repayment terms for each loan include equal monthly installments sufficient to amortize the loan over the term, with an option for the final installment to be greater than the others and is typically equal to the residual value guarantee the Company provides to the lender. The repayment term for each loan ranges from 
12
 months to 
48
 months. Interest is payable monthly in advance at a fixed interest rate equal to the 
three-year
 swap rate plus a spread of 
2.10
% on the date of the loan. Principal amounts outstanding related to the Master Vehicle Loan may be fully or partially prepaid at the option of Flexdrive and must be prepaid under certain circumstances. However, if a loan is terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the minimum loan term Flexdrive will be obligated to pay to the lender, an early termination fee in an amount which is equal to the interest which would otherwise be payable by Flexdrive to the lender for the remainder of the minimum loan term for that loan. The Master Vehicle Loan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Master Vehicle Loan as well as certain amounts held in escrow for the benefit of the lender. Amounts held in escrow are recorded as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. 
The Master Vehicle Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to Flexdrive or the Company, all amounts due under the Master Vehicle Loan may become immediately due and payable, among other remedies. As of December 31, 2024, Flexdrive was in compliance with all covenants related to the Master Vehicle Loan in all material respects.

Vehicle Procurement Agreement 
Following the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Vehicle Procurement Agreement (“VPA”), as amended, with a third-party (“the Procurement Provider”). Procurement services under the VPA include purchasing and upfitting certain motor vehicles as specified by Flexdrive, interim 
107
financing, providing certain fleet management services, including without limitation vehicle titling, registration and tracking services on behalf of Flexdrive. Pursuant to the terms of the VPA, Flexdrive will make the applicable payments to the Procurement Provider for the procurement services either directly or through an advance made by the Master Vehicle Loan or the Non-revolving Loan. Interest on interim financing under the VPA is based on the prime rate.
The Procurement Provider has a security interest in vehicles purchased until the full specified payment has been indefeasibly paid. The VPA contains customary affirmative and negative covenants restricting certain activities by Flexdrive. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the VPA.

95.0
 million revolving credit facility with a third-party lender to finance the acquisition of motor vehicles on behalf of Flexdrive under the VPA. On September 17, 2020, the revolving credit facility was amended, extending the stated maturity date to December 31, 2021 and reducing the borrowing capacity to $
50.0
 million. On March 11, 2019, Flexdrive entered into a Limited Non-Recourse Secured Continuing Guaranty and Subordination Agreement with the third-party lender to guarantee the Procurement Provider’s performance for any amount borrowed under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, there was a $
1.2
 million exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee. 
Revolving Credit Facility & Other Financings
On November 3, 2022, Lyft, Inc. entered into a revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, as the borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto from time to time. The Company amended the Revolving Credit Agreement on December 12, 2023, and on February 21, 2024, entered into Amendment No. 2 to Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things: (a) solely for the purposes of the financial covenant test, replace total leverage with total net leverage, which allows the Company to subtract the lesser of (i)(x) to the extent free cash flow for the most recently ended trailing four quarters is greater than $
100.0
 million, $
300.0
 million and (y) otherwise, $
200.0
 million and (ii) the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (as defined in Amendment No. 2 to the Revolving Credit Agreement) on its consolidated balance sheets as of the calculation date and (b) permit the Company to repurchase up to a specified amount of the Company’s common stock with the proceeds of a convertible note offering.
The Revolving Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $
420.0
 million that matures on November 3, 2027. The Company’s Liquidity (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) minus the aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2025 Convertible Notes (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) outstanding was not less than $
1.25
 billion as of February 13, 2025. As such, the Revolving Credit Facility did not mature on such date based on the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to certain conditions precedent, the Revolving Credit Agreement also grants the Company the option to increase the commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility by or obtain incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
300.0
 million, plus, after June 30, 2024, an unlimited amount so long as the senior secured leverage ratio does not exceed 
2.50
:1.00. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility, with a sublimit of $
168
 million for the issuance of letters of credit. 
Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, loans bear interest, at the Company’s option, at an annual rate equal to either (i) the sum of (x) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus (y) a variable rate based on the Company’s total leverage ratio, ranging from 
1.50
% to 
2.25
% or (ii) the sum of (x) the highest of (A) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate in effect in the United States, (B) the greater of the rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the federal funds effective rate or the rate that is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the overnight bank funding rate, in either case, plus 
0.50
%, and (C) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 
1.00
% and (y) a variable rate based on the Company’s total leverage ratio, ranging from 
0.05
% to 
1.25
%. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee between 
0.225
% and 0
.375
%, depending on the Company’s total leverage ratio, per annum on the undrawn portion available under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type that, among other things, restrict the Company and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, merge or consolidate or make certain dispositions, pay dividends and make distributions or other restricted payments, engage in transactions with affiliates, and make certain investments and acquisitions. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain (a) a minimum liquidity amount of at least $
1.5
 billion, tested on a quarterly basis, commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2022 through the quarter ending June 30, 2024, (b) a total net leverage ratio not to exceed 
3.50
:1.00 commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2024 through the quarter ending December 31, 2024 and commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2025, a ratio not to exceed 
3.00
:1.00 (with an increase to 
3.50
:1.00 if the Company has an acquisition for cash consideration greater than $
75
 million for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition takes place and the three fiscal quarters immediately following such acquisition), and (c) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 
1.25
:1.00, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2024. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breach of representation or warranty or covenants, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, and the occurrence of certain change of control events. Non-compliance 
108
with one or more of the covenants and restrictions or the occurrence of an event of default could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Revolving Credit Agreement becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments.
The Company’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company’s present and future material domestic subsidiaries. The Company’s obligations under, and each guarantor’s obligations under its guaranty of, the Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority interest on substantially all of the Company’s or such guarantor’s respective assets.

December 31, 2024
, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Revolving Credit Agreement and
 no amounts had been drawn under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Common Stock and Employee Stock Plans
Common Stock
The Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 
20
 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer. Any dividends paid to the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be paid on a pro rata basis. On a liquidation event, any distribution to common stockholders is made on a pro rata basis to the holders of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
Common Stock Repurchase
In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes in February 2024, the Company repurchased 
3,142,678
 shares of its Class A common stock from investors in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $
50.0
 million. The shares were repurchased at fair value and the entire repurchase price was allocated to the repurchase of the shares. The par value of the shares retired is charged against common stock and the remaining repurchase price is allocated to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company retired the shares upon repurchase. 
Equity Award Plans
2008 Equity Incentive Plan
In July 2008, the board of directors of the Company adopted the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan) under which the Company may grant options to purchase its common stock and offer to sell and issue restricted shares of its common stock and issue RSUs to selected employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company. In June 2018, this plan was superseded by the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan) and all reserved shares under the 2008 Plan were transferred to the 2018 Plan.
Under the 2008 Plan, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options are to be granted at a price that is not less than 
100
% of the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant; provided, that incentive stock options granted to a person who directly or by attribution owns more than ten percent (
10
%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company are to be at a price not less than one hundred ten percent (
110
%) of the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Stock options granted to newly hired employees typically vest 
25
% on the first anniversary of the date of hire and ratably each month over the ensuing 
36-month
 period. The maximum term for stock options granted under the 2008 Plan might not exceed 
ten years
 from the date of grant. RSUs granted to newly hired employees typically vest 
25
% on the first Company-established vest date after the first anniversary of the employee’s date of hire and ratably each quarter over the ensuing 
12-quarter
 period for purposes of the service condition. The maximum term for RSUs granted under the 2008 Plan might not exceed 
seven years
 from the date of grant.
2018 Equity Incentive Plan
In June 2018, the board of directors and the stockholders of the Company adopted the 2018 Plan, which serves as the successor to the 2008 Plan and provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and RSUs to employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and non-employee directors of the Company. A total of 
75,504,222
 shares of the Company’s common stock initially was reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan, which was increased in June 2018 by an additional 
11,836,692
 shares. In addition, the shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan also will include any shares subject to stock options, RSUs or similar awards granted under its 2008 Plan that, after the date the Company’s board of directors initially approved its 2018 Plan, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, are tendered to or withheld by the Company for payment of an exercise price or for satisfying tax withholding obligations or are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to failure to vest (provided that the maximum number of shares that may be added to its 2018 Plan from its 2008 Plan is 
75,504,222
 shares). Under the 2018 Plan, RSUs granted to newly hired employees typically vest 
25
% on the first Company-
109
established vest date after the first anniversary of the employee’s date of hire and ratably each quarter over the ensuing 12-quarter period for purposes of the service condition. The maximum term for RSUs granted under the 2018 Plan might not exceed 
seven years
 from the date of grant. In March 2019, this plan was superseded by the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan) and all reserved shares under the 2018 Plan were transferred to the 2019 Plan.
2019 Equity Incentive Plan
In March 2019, the board of directors of the Company and the stockholders of the Company adopted the 2019 Plan which serves as the successor to the 2018 Plan and provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and RSUs to employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and non-employee directors of the Company. RSUs granted with only service conditions under the 2019 Plan to employees generally vest in a period up to 
four years
. 
A total of 
44,000,000
 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2019 Plan. In addition, the shares reserved for issuance under the Company’s 2019 Plan also included (i) those shares reserved but unissued under our 2018 Plan as of immediately prior to the termination of the 2018 Plan and (ii) any shares subject to stock options, RSUs or similar awards granted under the 2018 Plan or 2008 Plan that, after the date the Company’s board of directors approved the 2019 Plan, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, are tendered to or withheld by the Company for payment of an exercise price or for satisfying tax withholding obligations or are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to failure to vest (provided that the maximum number of shares that may be added to the Company’s 2019 Plan pursuant to (i) and (ii) is 
80,604,678
 shares).
The number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan will be increased on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2020, in an amount equal to the least of (i) 
35,000,000
 shares, (ii) 
five
 percent of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (iii) such number of shares determined by the administrator. As of December 31, 2023, an additional 
67,071,304
 shares of Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan. On January 1, 2024, an additional 
19,990,283
 shares of Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan.

Included in the grants for the year ended December 31, 2024 are 
2,407,975
 shares of PSUs. These PSUs are divided into individual performance milestones and vesting tranches tied to the Company’s stock performance. On the grant date, the Company valued these PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model to determine for each milestone (i) the fair value to expense for such tranche and (ii) the requisite service period when the milestone for such tranche is expected to be achieved. The Monte Carlo valuation model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards including the Company's stock price on grant date, expected term, expected volatility, and risk-free interest rate. The resulting fair value is amortized beginning on the grant date over the requisite service periods of each individual tranche. 
All PSUs are subject to a continuous service condition in addition to certain performance criteria. 
The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
337.4
 million, $
290.5
 million and $
354.3
 million, respectively. In connection with RSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company withheld 
2,528,016
 shares and remitted cash payments of $
40.3
 million on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities. In connection with RSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company withheld 
295,948
 shares and remitted cash payments of $
3.0
 million on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities. In connection with RSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company withheld 
358,330
 shares and remitted cash payments of $
6.7
 million on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities.
In November 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved the transition to the net settlement method as the Company’s withholding method for RSUs. Prior to this, the Company’s withholding method was the sell-to-cover method with the exception of RSUs held by officers, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for which the tax withholding method was the net settlement method.
As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost was $
160.4
 million related to all unvested awards. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 
1.0
 year. The Company recognizes compensation expense on the RSUs granted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attribution method. All RSUs granted after March 28, 2019 vest on the satisfaction of a service-based condition only. The Company recognizes compensation expense for such RSUs upon a straight-line basis over their requisite service periods. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each individual tranche.

2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In March 2019, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The initial ESPP went into effect on March 27, 2019 and was amended on July 26, 2021 and July 18, 2022. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute, through payroll deductions, up to 
15
% of their eligible compensation to purchase the Company’s Class A common stock at a discounted price per share. The ESPP provides for consecutive, overlapping 
12-month
 offering periods, subject to certain reset provisions as defined in the plan. 
111
A total of 
6,000,000
 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2023, 
13,414,259
 additional shares of Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP. On January 1, 2024, an additional 
3,998,056
 shares of Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2024, 
6,230,976
 shares of Class A common stock have been purchased under the 2019 ESPP. The number of shares reserved under the 2019 ESPP automatically increases on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2020 in a number of shares equal to the least of (i) 
7,000,000
 shares of Class A common stock, (ii) 
one
 percent of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the 2019 ESPP

The valuation allowance decreased by $
25.4
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the increase of $
8.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company believes that, based on a number of factors including its history of net losses, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of its U.S. deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. 
Based on the Company’s assessment of current and anticipated future earnings, it is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence of sustained U.S. profitability may become available in the foreseeable future to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on the level of profitability that the Company is actually able to achieve.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
7.2
 billion and $
6.2
 billion, respectively.
The federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2035 and will continue to expire through 2037, while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2025 and will continue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations including the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2024 with the exception of tax years beginning before 2020 in Canada and 2023 in the United Kingdom.
113
The Company has not provided foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, because it intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will be immaterial, due to the participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has 
no
t recognized any interest and penalties in its consolidated statements of operations, 
no
r has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. The Company has 
no
 material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders, the dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected by application of the treasury stock method and convertible securities by application of the if-converted method, as applicable. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2029 Notes, the 2025 Notes, and stock purchase rights granted under the Company’s ESPP are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders when including them has an anti-dilutive effect. Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into the Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's Class A common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the Notes are settled in cash, to reduce the cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the Notes the Company's Class A common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Notes. Refer to Note 11 “Debt” to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

November 2022 Restructuring Plan
In November 2022, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses. As a result of the restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded $
29.5
 million in employee severance and other employee costs and $
9.5
 million in net stock-based compensation expense related to equity compensation for employees impacted by the plan of termination. 
The Company’s plan of termination also included restructuring charges related to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with the Company’s anticipated operating needs. The Company reassessed its real estate asset groups and estimated the fair value of the space to be subleased using current market conditions. Where the carrying value of the individual asset groups exceeded their fair value, an impairment charge was recognized for the difference. During the year ended December 31, 2022, this included $
55.3
 million in impairment charges related to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets, $
23.9
 million in accelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets and $
2.1
 million in write-off fixed assets not yet placed into service. As a result of the above, the Company incurred net restructuring charges of $
120.3
 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. 
In the first quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the exit of certain leases as part of the plan of termination and the Company completed a transaction for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company’s first party vehicle services business. As a result, the Company recorded $
10.5
 million in impairment charges related to the cease use of certain facilities to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets and other costs, which included $
9.1
 million of future payments associated with exiting certain facilities. The Company also incurred employee related charges, which include employee severance, benefits and stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2023. As a result of the above, the Company incurred net restructuring charges of $
24.4
 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. The restructuring plan has been completed as of the year ended December 31, 2023.

Variable Interest Entities
VIEs Related to the Acquisition of PBSC
As part of its acquisition of PBSC, the Company acquired several joint ventures (“JVs”) which were deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in accordance with ASC 810 
Consolidation
 on the acquisition date. The Company determined that PBSC is the primary beneficiary of 
one
 of the acquired VIEs, in which it owns an 
80
% equity interest, as PBSC has the power to direct the majority of the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits. As PBSC is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest, revenues and operating results are included in the consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the acquisition, PBSC entered into joint ventures deemed to be VIEs which were accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial.
The acquisition date fair value of the VIEs acquired as part of the PBSC acquisition was $
22.2
 million, which exceeded the carrying value and was recorded within other investments in the consolidated balance sheets.
Other than the VIE of which PBSC owns an 
80
% equity interest, the Company has determined that PBSC does not direct the activities that would significantly affect the economic performance of these VIEs. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As a result, the Company accounts for its investment in these VIEs under the equity method, and they are not consolidated into the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the reported profits or losses of these VIEs in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to its investment in VIEs in the consolidated balance sheets. The profits and losses of these unconsolidated VIEs were not material to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The maximum potential financial statement loss the Company would incur if these VIEs were to default on all their obligations would be the loss of the carrying value of these investments as well as any current or future investments, if any, PBSC were to make which was immaterial as of December 31, 2024. 
Other VIEs
During the second quarter of 2023, the Company contributed a business to a privately held company in exchange for an equity interest and a seat on the board of directors of such company. This privately held company was determined to be a VIE for which the Company lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. As the Company is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the VIE. However, due to the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence, the investment will be accounted for under the equity method. The investment was recorded at its initial fair value of $
12.9
 million and represents the Company’s maximum exposure to the VIE. During the year ended December 31, 2024, there was no change in the Company's claim on the net assets of the investment and therefore, the Company did not recognize equity method gain or loss nor was there an impairment of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an immaterial amount of equity earnings and there was no impairment of the investment.

Subsequent Events
Share Repurchase Program
On February 6, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to $
500
 million of the Company’s Class A common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its Class A common stock and may be suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and other factors.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
