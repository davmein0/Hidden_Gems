Item 1. Business - Key Production Costs - Electrical Power Supply Agreements
 for additional information about these market-based power agreements.
Power is supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements with three separate suppliers - HS, Landsvirkjun and OR. These power purchase agreements, which expire on various dates from 2026 through 2036 (subject to extension). The power purchase agreements with each of HS and OR provide power at LME-based variable rates for the duration of these agreements.  The larger Landsvirkjun agreement provides for fixed rate with an additional variable rate linked to the LME. 
From time to time, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in the market price of power through financial instruments designed to protect our downside risk exposure. 
Electrical Power Price Sensitivity
Given our market-based power supply agreements, we have electrical power price risk for our operations, whether due to fluctuations in the price of power available on the MISO power market or the price of natural gas or other inputs. Power represents one of our largest operating costs, so changes in the price and/or availability of market power could significantly impact the profitability and viability of our operations. Transmission line outages, problems with grid stability or limitations on energy import capability could also increase power prices, disrupt production through pot instability or force a curtailment of all or part of the production at these facilities. In addition, indirect factors that lead to power cost increases, such as any increasing prices for natural gas or coal, fluctuations in or extremes in weather patterns or new or more stringent environmental regulations may severely impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Foreign Currency
We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the Iceland krona ("ISK"), the Euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Jamaican dollar and other currencies. Grundartangi’s labor costs, part of its maintenance costs and other local services are denominated in ISK and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in Euros and Chinese renminbi. We also have deposits denominated in ISK in Icelandic banks, and our estimated payments of Icelandic income taxes and any associated refunds are denominated in ISK. Vlissingen's labor costs, maintenance costs and other local services are denominated in Euros. Further, Jamalco's labor costs, maintenance costs, and other local services are denominated in Jamaican dollars. We also have deposits denominated in Jamaican dollars in Jamaican banks and our estimated payments of Jamaican income taxes and any associated refunds are denominated in Jamaican dollars. As a result, an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would affect Grundartangi’s, Vlissingen's and Jamalco's operating margins.
We may manage our exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts or option contracts for forecasted transactions and projected cash flows for foreign currencies in future periods. We have entered into financial contracts to hedge the risk of fluctuations associated with the ISK and Euro under our casthouse currency hedges.
Natural Economic Hedges
Any analysis of our exposure to the commodity price of aluminum should consider the impact of natural hedges provided by certain contracts that contain pricing indexed to the LME price for primary aluminum. Certain of our alumina contracts and a substantial portion of Grundartangi’s electrical power requirements are indexed to the LME price for primary aluminum and provide a natural hedge for a portion of our production.
Risk Management
Any metals, power, natural gas and foreign currency risk management activities are subject to the control and direction of senior management within guidelines established by Century’s Board of Directors. These activities are regularly reported to and reviewed by Century’s Board of Directors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Century Aluminum Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Century Aluminum Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an adverse opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting because of material weaknesses. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements.
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment (“long-lived assets”) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, known as triggering events, indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group, may not be recoverable. Management considers various factors when determining if long-lived assets should be evaluated for impairment, including a significant adverse change in the business climate or industry conditions (such as sustained decreases in commodity prices, volatility in energy costs, and the global economy), a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a current expectation that the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life. 
We identified the identification of impairment indicators for long-lived assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes when determining whether events or circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying 
50
amounts of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately identified impairment indicators. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the assessment of possible indicators of impairment included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to management’s identification of events or circumstances that may indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
•
We evaluated management’s analysis of impairment indicators by:
•
Assessing whether asset groups having indicators of impairment were appropriately identified or considered.
•
Considering industry conditions, commodity price trends and the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as adverse changes in the regulatory environment, legislation or other factors that may represent impairment indicators not previously contemplated in management’s analysis.
•
Evaluating management’s judgements around historical trends, macroeconomic and industry conditions, and whether forecasts are consistent with the Company’s operating strategy.
•
Evaluating reasonableness of management’s assessment of future market prices of the revenue-generating commodity and future input costs necessary for operations by comparing these against available forward market pricing data. 
•
Inspecting minutes of the board of directors and committees of executive management to understand if there were factors that would represent potential impairment indicators for the Company’s asset groups.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Century Aluminum Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Century Aluminum Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated March 3, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Material Weaknesses
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment:
52
Management identified a material weakness related to the failure to design and implement appropriate information technology controls in the areas of logical access controls including provisioning, deprovisioning, privileged access, user access review, application changes and monitoring relating to its Jamalco JV.
Management identified that the Company's Jamalco JV failed to design and implement appropriate business process level controls, including controls to address the completeness and accuracy of information derived from its affected information technology systems, which resulted in a material weakness related to reconciliation controls and insufficient review controls related to inventories, accounts payable, cost of goods sold and property, plant, and equipment.   
These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements.

1.  
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization —
 Century Aluminum Company ("Century Aluminum," "Century," the "Company", "we", "us", "our" or "ours") is a holding company, whose principal subsidiaries are Nordural ehf (together with its subsidiaries, "Nordural"), Century Aluminum Sebree LLC ("Century Sebree"), Century Aluminum of South Carolina ("CASC") and Century Kentucky, Inc. ("CAKY"). Nordural Grundartangi ehf, a subsidiary of Nordural, operates a primary aluminum smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland ("Grundartangi"). Century Sebree operates a primary aluminum smelter in Robards, Kentucky ("Sebree"). CASC operates a primary aluminum reduction smelter in Goose Creek, South Carolina ("Mt. Holly"). CAKY owns a primary aluminum smelter in Hawesville, Kentucky ("Hawesville").
In addition to our primary aluminum assets, we have a 
55
% joint venture interest in the Jamalco bauxite mining operation and alumina refinery in Jamaica ("Jamalco"). The Jamalco refinery supplies a substantial amount of the alumina used for production of primary aluminum at our aluminum smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland. Additionally, our subsidiary, Century Aluminum Vlissingen B.V., owns and operates a carbon anode production facility located in Vlissingen, the Netherlands ("Vlissingen"). Carbon anodes are used in the production of primary aluminum and Vlissingen currently supplies carbon anodes to Grundartangi.
As of December 31, 2024, Glencore owns 
42.9
% of Century’s outstanding common stock (
45.8
% on a fully-diluted basis assuming the conversion of all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock) and all of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. See 
Note 9. Shareholders' Equity
 for a full description of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Century and Glencore enter into various transactions from time to time such as the purchase and sale of primary aluminum, purchase and sale of alumina and raw materials, tolling agreements as well as forward financial contracts and borrowing and other debt transactions. See 
Note 4. Related Party Transactions
.
Basis of Presentation —
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Century Aluminum Company and our subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions and accounts.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Our consolidated financial statements include the consolidated results of the Jamalco joint venture, an unincorporated joint venture between General Alumina Jamaica Limited ("GAJL"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Clarendon Alumina Production Limited ("CAP"). CAP's interest in the joint venture is reflected as noncontrolling interest on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Variable Interest Entities
 - We evaluate arrangements and contracts with other entities to determine if they are VIEs and if we are the primary beneficiary. GAAP provides a framework for identifying VIEs and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest, and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.
A VIE should be consolidated if a party with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable interest holder) has the power to direct the VIE’s most significant activities and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. A variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE’s assets, liabilities, and non-controlling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were consolidated.
Our evaluation of whether our interest qualifies as the primary beneficiary of a VIE involves significant judgments, estimates and assumptions and includes a qualitative analysis of the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and whether the Company has the power to direct those activities, the design of the entity, the rights of the parties and the purpose of the arrangement. Jamalco is a VIE. See

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 — Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash, money market funds and short-term investments having original maturities of three months or less. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable and Due from Affiliates —
 These amounts are net of an allowance for expected losses of 
$
0.5
 million
 at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Inventories —
 Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") and the weighted average cost method. Due to the nature of our business, our inventory values are subject to market price changes and these changes can have a significant impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit in any period. Reductions in net realizable value below cost basis at the end of a period will have an impact on our cost of goods sold as this inventory is sold in subsequent periods.
Property, Plant and Equipment
 — Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements are capitalized when each asset is placed into service. Asset and accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved for dispositions with resulting gains or losses included in Other income (loss) - net. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided for by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Building and improvements    
10
 to 
45
 years
Machinery and equipment    
5
 to 
35
 years
Technology and software    
3
 to 
7
 years
The Company incurs deferred costs during the development stage of a mine life cycle. Such costs include the construction of access and haul roads, detailed drilling and geological analysis to further define the grade and quality of the known bauxite, and overburden removal costs. These costs relate to sections of the related mines where the Company is currently extracting bauxite or preparing for production in the near term. These sections are outlined and planned incrementally and generally are mined over periods outlined in the Company's mine plans. The amount of geological drilling and testing necessary to determine the economic viability of the bauxite deposit being mined is such that the resources are considered to be proved mineral reserves.  Mineral reserves are amortized on a units-of-production basis.
Impairment of long-lived assets —
 The Company reviews property, plant and equipment ("long-lived assets") for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, known as triggering events, indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or an asset group may not be recoverable. Management considers various factors when determining if long-lived assets should be evaluated for impairment, including a significant adverse change in the business climate or industry conditions (such as sustained decreases in commodity prices, volatility in energy costs, and the global economy), a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a current expectation that the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life. If a triggering event is identified, the Company determines if the long-lived asset or asset group is recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group held and used to estimate undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived asset or asset group. Impairment evaluation and fair value is based on estimates and assumptions that take into account our business plans and a long-term investment horizon, including consideration of commodity pricing, energy costs and other global economic conditions which may have an adverse effect on recoverability. If deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group.
Leases — 
We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the arrangement based on the terms and conditions in the contract. A contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset which we have the right to control. We have made a policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components within contracts. We have also elected not to recognize the impact of short term leases in the right of use asset ("ROUA") and right of use liability ("ROUL") balances. Short term leases are leases that have a lease term less than one year and do not include a purchase option.
Income Taxes —
 We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In evaluating our ability to realize deferred tax assets, we use judgment to determine if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, and if a corresponding valuation allowance is required.
61
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits —
 We sponsor defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for certain of our domestic hourly and salaried employees and a supplemental executive retirement benefit plan for certain current and former executive officers. Plan assets and obligations are measured annually or more frequently if there is a re-measurement event, based on the Company’s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions. We attribute the service costs for the plans over the working lives of plan participants. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. Actuarial gains or losses are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
We contribute to our defined benefit pension plans based upon actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of the projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements.
Postemployment Benefits —
 We provide certain postemployment benefits to certain former and inactive employees and their dependents during the period following employment, but before retirement. These benefits include salary continuance, supplemental unemployment and disability health care. We recognize the estimated future cost of providing postemployment benefits on an accrual basis over the active service life of the employee.
Derivatives and Hedging —
 As a global producer of primary aluminum, our operating results and cash flows from operations are subject to risk of fluctuations in the market prices of primary aluminum. We may from time to time enter into financial contracts to manage our exposure to such risk. Derivative instruments may consist of variable to fixed financial contracts and back-to-back fixed to floating arrangements for a portion of our sale of primary aluminum, where we receive fixed and pay floating prices from our customers and to counterparties, respectively.
From time to time, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in the market price of power through financial instruments designed to protect our downside risk exposure. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk, and we may manage our exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts or option contracts for forecasted transactions and projected cash flows for foreign currencies in future periods. 
Our derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivative and hedging instruments are recorded in due from affiliates, derivative assets, other assets, due to affiliates, derivative liabilities and derivative liabilities - less current portion in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We value our derivative and hedging instruments using quoted market prices and other significant unobservable inputs.
We recognize changes in fair value and settlements of derivative instruments in net gain (loss) on forward and derivative contracts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as they occur.
Unrealized gains on forward and derivative contracts are reported as part of cash flows from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Foreign Currency –
 We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the Euro and the Icelandic krona ("ISK"), and the Chinese renminbi. Grundartangi, Vlissingen and Jamalco use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, as contracts for sales of aluminum and alumina and purchases of alumina and power are denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise and any transaction gains and losses are reflected in Other income (loss) - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Financial Instruments —
 Receivables, certain life insurance policies, payables, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and debt related to industrial revenue bonds ("IRBs") are carried at amounts that approximate fair value.
Earnings per share —
 Basic earnings (loss) per share ("EPS") amounts are calculated by dividing earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between shares of common stock and other participating securities based on their participating rights. Net loss is not allocated to other participating securities if they are not obligated to share in the losses based on their contractual terms. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted loss per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
62
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
The dilutive effect to earnings per share is determined using the "if converted" method whereby, if the conversion of the convertible notes would be dilutive, interest expense on the outstanding notes is added back to the diluted earnings numerator and all of the potentially dilutive shares are included in the diluted common shares outstanding denominator for the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is a non-cumulative perpetual participating convertible preferred stock with no set dividend preferences. In periods where we report net losses, we do not allocate these losses to the Convertible Preferred Stock for the computation of basic or diluted EPS.
Asset Retirement Obligations —
 We are subject to environmental regulations which create certain legal obligations related to the normal operations of our bauxite mine and alumina refinery and our domestic primary aluminum smelter operations. Our asset retirement obligations ("AROs") consist primarily of costs associated with mine reclamation obligations, closure of bauxite residue areas, landfill closure, and the disposal of spent potliner used in the reduction cells of our domestic smelters. AROs are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred (when the potliner is put in service or upon disturbance of lands to be mined) and accreted over time for the change in the present value of the liability. We capitalize the asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful lives. 
Certain conditional asset retirement obligations ("CAROs") related to the remediation of our primary aluminum facilities for hazardous material, such as landfill materials and asbestos, have not been recorded because they have an indeterminate settlement date. CAROs are a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control.
Concentrations of Credit Risk —
 Financial instruments, which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade receivables. Our limited customer base increases our concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables. We routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and collectability of our trade receivables and recognize an allowance based on our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in accordance with the current expected credit loss ("CECL") model.
Share-Based Compensation — 
We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. We recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We issue shares to satisfy the requirements of our share-based compensation plans. At this time, we do not plan to issue treasury shares to support our share-based compensation plans, but we may in the future. We award performance units to certain officers and employees. The performance units may be settled in cash or common stock at the discretion of the Board. We have not issued any stock options since 2009.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, that requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard also requires disclosure of the composition of other segment items included in the measure of segment profit or loss that are not separately disclosed. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this accounting standard for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024, retrospectively. Therefore, prior periods have been updated to conform with the current period presentation. See 
Note 19. Business 
S
egments
 for our reportable segment disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, that requires presentation of specific categories of reconciling items, as well as reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, in the reconciliation between the income tax provision and the income tax provision using statutory tax rates. The standard also requires disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction with separate disclosure of income taxes paid to individual jurisdictions that meet a quantitative threshold. The amendments in this accounting standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, but will require certain additional disclosures. The Company plans to adopt this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the annual period ending December 31, 2025.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, that requires disclosure of the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense line item on the income statement. The standard also requires a qualitative description of other amounts included in each relevant expense line item on the income statement that are not separately disclosed. In addition, entities are required to disclose the nature and amount of selling expenses. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect any impact to the consolidated financial statements, but the standard will require certain additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the Company plans to adopt this guidance for the annual period ending December 31, 2027.

Acquisition of Jamalco
On May 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Jamaica Holdings, Inc., completed the acquisition of all the outstanding share capital of General Alumina Holdings Limited, the holder of a 
55
% interest in Jamalco JV ("Jamalco"), an unincorporated joint venture engaged in bauxite mining and alumina production in Jamaica. The remaining 
45
% interest in Jamalco is owned by Clarendon Alumina Production Limited ("CAP"), which in turn is owned by the Government of Jamaica. The purchase price for the acquisition was $
1.00
. The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain in part due to the seller experiencing financial distress following curtailment of Jamalco's operations in the second half of 2021 due to a facility fire, with operations restarting in the second half of 2022.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations, resulting in the Company recognizing the assets and liabilities at fair value with the excess over fair value of consideration transferred to the seller presented as a bargain purchase gain of $
245.9
 million recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company finalized the Jamalco purchase price allocation and recognized measurement period adjustments, which primarily resulted from third-party valuation adjustments to risk premiums, reducing the value of property, plant and equipment by $
29.0
 million. This reduction in value of property plant and equipment resulted in a corresponding reduction to the bargain purchase gain of $
29.0
 million decreasing the value of the previously deferred bargain purchase gain of $
273.4
 million as of December 31, 2023.  The Company finalized its purchase accounting as of March 31, 2024.

We enter into contracts to sell mainly primary aluminum to our customers. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligations with our customers are satisfied. Our obligations under the contracts are satisfied when we transfer control of our primary aluminum to our customers which is generally upon shipment or delivery to customer directed locations. The amount of consideration we receive, thus the revenue we recognize, is a function of volume delivered, market price of primary aluminum, which is based on the LME, plus regional premiums and any value-added product premiums or alumina which is based on the alumina pricing index, plus Atlantic differential.
The payment terms and conditions in our contracts vary and are not significant to our revenue. We complete an appropriate credit evaluation for each customer at contract inception. Customer payments are due in arrears and are recognized as accounts receivable - net and due from affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In connection with our sales agreements with certain customers, including Glencore, we invoice the customer prior to physical shipment of goods for a majority of production generated from each of our U.S. domestic smelters. For those sales, revenue is recognized only when the customer has specifically requested such treatment and has made a commitment to purchase the product. The goods must be complete, ready for shipment and separated from other inventory with control over the goods passing to the customer. We must retain no further performance obligations.
Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, amounts recorded in Due to affiliates were  $
41.2
 million and $
30.6
 million, respectively.

6.  
Leases
We are a lessee in various agreements for the lease of office space, land, automobiles, and mobile equipment. All of our leases are considered operating leases. The terms of our leases vary, including the lease term and the ability to renew or extend certain leases. As part of determining the lease term and potential extensions for purposes of calculating the ROUA and ROUL, we consider our historical practices related to renewal of certain leases. The weighted average remaining lease term for our

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
operating leases was 
10.1
 years as of December 31, 2024 and 
11.8
 years as of December 31, 2023. Certain lease payment amounts are variable in nature and change periodically based on the local market consumer price index.
We use our incremental borrowing rate as the basis for the discount rate used to calculate the ROUA and ROUL, respectively, for our operating leases. The incremental borrowing rate is determined on a lease-by-lease basis and is based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to our lease payments. We consider the most likely financing options available for each lease based on the leased asset, legal entity party to the lease, economic environment in which the lease is denominated, the market conditions relative to the leased asset and our historical practices of obtaining financing for similar types of costs. The weighted average discount rate for our operating leases was 
7.5
% as of December 31, 2024 and 
7.3
% as of December 31, 2023.
Our ROUA and ROUL balances for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):

7.  
Fair Value Measurements 
We measure certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
In general, reporting entities should apply valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions and estimates that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
The fair value hierarchy provides transparency regarding the inputs we use to measure fair value. We categorize each fair value measurement in its entirety into the following three levels, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement:
•
Level 1 Inputs – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 Inputs – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

When valuing Level 3 assets and liabilities, we use certain significant unobservable inputs. Management incorporates various inputs and assumptions including forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility and macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and discount rates. Our estimates of significant unobservable inputs are ultimately based on our estimates of risks that market participants would consider when valuing our assets and liabilities.
As of the years ending December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were 
no
 Level 3 assets and liabilities.

%
 senior secured notes due 2028 (the "2028 Notes"). We received proceeds of $
245.2
 million, after payment of certain financing fees and related expenses.
Interest Rate. 
The 2028 Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2021, at a rate of 
7.5
%
 per annum in cash.
Maturity. 
The 2028 Notes mature on April 1, 2028.
Seniority. 
The 2028 Notes are senior secured obligations of Century, ranking equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of Century, but effectively senior to unsecured debt to the extent of the value of collateral.
Guaranty
. Our obligations under the 2028 Notes are guaranteed by all of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”), except for foreign owned holding companies, any domestic restricted subsidiary that owns no assets other than equity interests or other investments in foreign subsidiaries and certain immaterial subsidiaries, which guaranty shall in each case be a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor Subsidiaries, ranking equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of such Guarantor Subsidiaries but effectively senior to unsecured debt to the extent of the value of collateral.
Collateral.
 Our obligations under the 2028 Notes and the Guarantor Subsidiaries' obligations under the guarantees are secured by a pledge of and lien on (subject to certain exceptions):
71
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
(i) all of our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries' property, plant and equipment (other than certain excluded property);
(ii) all equity interests in subsidiaries directly owned by Century or any Guarantor Subsidiaries; and
(iii) proceeds of the foregoing.
Under certain circumstances, the indenture and the security documents governing the 2028 Notes will permit us and the Guarantors to incur additional debt that also may be secured by liens on the collateral that are equal to or have priority over the liens securing the 2028 Notes. The collateral agent for the 2028 Notes will agree with the collateral agent for the other debt holders and us under such circumstances to enter into an intercreditor agreement that will cause the liens securing the 2028 Notes to be contractually subordinated to the liens securing such additional debt.
Redemption Rights. 
Prior to April 1, 2024, we may redeem the 2028 Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 
100.00
% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, and if redeemed during the 
twelve-month
 period beginning on April 1 of the years indicated below, at the following redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest:

2024
103.750

2025
101.875
%
2026 and Thereafter
100.000
%
Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes), we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2028 Notes at a purchase price equal to 
101
% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2028 Notes on the date of the purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase.
Covenants
. The indenture governing the 2028 Notes contains customary covenants which may limit our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur additional liens; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock; (iv) purchase or redeem capital stock; (v) make investments or certain other restricted payments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with shareholders or affiliates; and (ix) effect a consolidation or merger.
Fair Value. 
As of December 31, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the 2028 Notes was
 $
253.1
 million
. Although we use quoted market prices for identical debt instruments, the markets on which they trade are not considered to be active and are therefore considered Level 2 fair value measurements.
2.75
% Convertible Notes due 2028
General. 
On April 9, 2021, we completed a private offering of $
86.3
 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2028 (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes were issued at a price of 
100
% of their aggregate principal amount. We received proce
eds of $
83.7
 million, a
fter payment of certain financing fees and related expenses.
The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 53.3547 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
18.74
 per share of the Company's common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the indenture.
Interest Rate. 
The Convertible Notes will bear interest semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2021, at a rate of 
2.75
% per annum in cash.
Maturity. 
The Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, repurchased, or redeemed.
Seniority. 
The Convertible Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s senior secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries.

Redemption rights. 
We may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to May 6, 2025. On or after May 6, 2025, we may redeem for cash all or part of the Convertible Notes at our option if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading-day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Upon conversion, we may satisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, based on the applicable conversion rate. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. Additionally, in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture), holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of the fundamental change repurchase. 
As of December 31, 2024, the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes did not exceed the outstanding principal amount.
Fair Value.
 As of December 31, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was 
$
102.6
 million
. Although we use quoted market prices for identical debt instruments, the markets on which they trade are not considered to be active and are therefore considered Level 2 fair value measurements.
U.S. Revolving Credit Facility
General
. We and certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the "Borrowers") have a senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the "U.S. revolving credit facility"). On June 14, 2022 we amended our U.S. revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $
250.0
 million, including up to $
150.0
 million under a letter of credit sub-facility. The U.S. revolving credit facility matures on June 14, 2027.
Any letters of credit issued and outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit facility reduce our borrowing availability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. At December 31, 2024, there were 
$
20.0
 million outstanding borrowings and $
63.7
 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our U.S. revolving credi
t facility. Principal payments, if any, are due upon maturity of the U.S. revolving credit facility and may be prepaid without penalty.

Borrowing Base. 
The availability of funds under the U.S. revolving credit facility is limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of the Borrower's accounts receivable and inventory which meet the eligibility criteria.
Guaranty. 
The Borrowers' obligations under the U.S. revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by a continuing lien upon and a security interest in all of the Borrowers' accounts receivable, inventory and certain bank accounts. Each Borrower is liable for any and all obligations under the U.S. revolving credit facility on a joint and several basis.
Interest Rates and Fees.
 Any amounts outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit facility will bear interest at our option of either the secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") or a base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable interest margin. The applicable interest margin is determined based on the average daily availability for the immediately preceding quarter. In addition, we pay an unused line fee on undrawn amounts, less the amount of our letters of credit exposure. For standby letters of credit, we are required to pay a fee on the face amount of such letters of credit that varies depending on whether the letter of credit exposure is cash collateralized.

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
Shares Authorized and Outstanding. 
In 2008, we issued 
160,000
 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Glencore holds all of the issued and outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
49,715
 shares and 
52,284
 shares were outstanding, respectively. 
The issuance of common stock under our stock incentive programs, debt exchange transactions and any stock offering that excludes Glencore participation triggers anti-dilution provisions of the preferred stock agreement and results in the automatic conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shares into shares of common stock. The conversion of preferred to common shares is 
100
 shares of common for each share of preferred stock. Our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has a par value of $
0.01
 per share.
Dividend Rights. 
So long as any shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, we may not pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution upon or in respect of our common stock or any other capital stock ranking, on a parity with or junior to, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of dividends or liquidation preference, unless we, at the same time, declare and pay a dividend or distribution on the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (a) in an amount equal to the amount such holders would receive if they were the holders of the number of shares of our common stock into which their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for such dividend or distribution, or (b) in the case of a dividend or distribution on other capital stock ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in such amount and in such form as (based on the determination of holders of a majority of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock) will preserve, without dilution, the economic position of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock relative to such other capital stock.
Voting Rights. 
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has no voting rights for the election of directors or on other matters where the shares of common stock have voting rights. However, we may not change the powers, preferences, or rights given to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or authorize, create or issue any additional shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting separately as a class).
Liquidation Rights. 
Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of Century, the holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a preferential distribution of $
0.01
 per share out of the assets available for distribution. In addition, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Century, if our assets are sufficient to make any distribution to the holders of the common stock, then the holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are also entitled to share ratably with the holders of common stock in the distribution of Century’s assets (as though the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were holders of that number of shares of common stock into which their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible). However, the amount of any such distribution will be reduced by the amount of the preferential distribution received by the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
Transfer Restrictions. 
Glencore is prohibited from transferring shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to any party other than an affiliate who agrees to become bound by certain agreements associated with these shares.
Automatic Conversion. 
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converts, without any further act of Century or any holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, into shares of common stock, at a conversion ratio of 
100
 shares of common stock for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, upon the occurrence of any of the following automatic conversion events:
•
If we sell or issue shares of common stock or any other stock that votes generally with our common stock, or the occurrence of any other event, including a sale, transfer or other disposition of common stock by Glencore, as a result of which the percentage of voting stock held by Glencore decreases, an amount of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will convert to common stock to restore Glencore to its previous ownership percentage;
•
If shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are transferred to an entity that is not an affiliate of Glencore, such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will convert to shares of our common stock, provided that such transfers may only be made pursuant to an effective registration statement;
•
Upon a sale of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock by Glencore in a Rule 144 transaction in which the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock issuable upon the conversion thereof are not directed to 
77
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
any purchaser, such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock sold will convert to shares of our common stock; and
•
Immediately prior to and conditioned upon the consummation of a merger, reorganization or consolidation to which we are a party or a sale, abandonment, transfer, lease, license, mortgage, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our property or assets, in one or a series of transactions where, in any such case, all of our common stock would be converted into the right to receive, or exchanged for, cash and/or securities, other than any transaction in which the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be redeemed.
Optional Conversion. 
Glencore has the option to convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in a tender offer or exchange offer, at the same conversion ratio as above, in which a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock have been tendered by the holders thereof and not duly withdrawn at the expiration time of such tender or exchange offer, so long as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is tendered or exchanged in such offer.
Stock Combinations 
– 
Adjustments. 
If, at any time while the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, Century combines outstanding common stock into a smaller number of shares, then the number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Redemptions or Repurchases of Common Stock. 
We may not redeem or repurchase our common stock unless we redeem or repurchase, or otherwise make a payment on, a pro-rata number of shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. These restrictions do not apply to our open market repurchases or our repurchases pursuant to our employee benefit plans.
Right of Redemption. 
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be redeemed by Century if any of the following events occur (at a redemption price based on the trading price of our common stock prior to the announcement of such event) and Glencore votes its shares of our common stock in opposition to such events:
•
We propose a merger, reorganization or consolidation, sale, abandonment, transfer, lease, license, mortgage, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our property or assets where any of our common stock would be converted into the right to receive, or exchanged for, assets other than cash and/or securities traded on a national stock exchange or that are otherwise readily marketable, or
•
We propose to dissolve and wind up operations and any assets, other than cash and/or securities traded on a national stock exchange or that are otherwise readily marketable, are to be distributed to the holders of our common stock.
Stock Repurchase Program
In 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a $
60.0
 million stock repurchase program and during the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors increased the size of the program by $
70.0
 million. Under the program, Century is authorized to repurchase up to $
130.0
 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, from time to time, on the open market at prevailing market prices, in block trades or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and other factors. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Shares of common stock repurchased are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. From time to time, treasury shares may be reissued as contributions to our employee benefit plans and for the conversion of preferred stock. When shares are reissued, we use an average cost method for determining cost. The difference between the cost of the shares and the reissuance price is added to or deducted from additional paid-in capital.
Through December 31, 2024, we repurchased 
7,186,521
 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $
86.3
 million. We have made 
no
 repurchases since April 2015 and have approximately $
43.7
 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization as of December 31, 2024.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits
We maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for certain foreign and domestic hourly and salaried employees. For the eligible domestic salaried employees, plan benefits are based primarily on years of service and average compensation during the later years of employment. For hourly employees, plan benefits are based primarily on a formula that provides a specific benefit for each year of service. Plan benefits are available to all permanent foreign employees. Our funding policy is to contribute amounts based upon actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of the projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). In addition, we maintain the supplemental executive retirement benefit ("SERB") plan for certain current and former executive officers, which is frozen to future accruals.
Other Postretirement Benefits ("OPEB")
In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for certain foreign and domestic retired employees. We accrue the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire. We fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims.
Retiree medical welfare changes 
Under the current Hawesville labor agreement, employees who retire during the term of the labor agreement have been divided into sub-groups based on attributes such as Medicare eligibility, hire date, age and years of service. Levels of benefits are defined for the sub-groups and range from no substantive change from the benefits provided under the previous labor agreement to replacement of the defined retiree medical benefit program with individual health reimbursement accounts for each eligible participant. The health reimbursement accounts are funded based on established rates per hour worked by each eligible participant. Eligible participants will be able to withdraw from their health reimbursement accounts to fund their own retiree medical coverage.
During 2017, the Company amended its non-union retiree medical and life insurance benefits to align the Company’s benefits with the market and achieve a uniform retiree medical benefit design across the Company’s U.S. locations. Effective January 1, 2018, non-union retiree medical and life insurance benefits are restricted to current participants who meet the eligibility criteria as of January 1, 2018. Additionally, effective January 1, 2019, Century no longer administers non-union retiree medical, prescription drug, dental, or vision benefits and instead makes fixed health reimbursement account contributions.

Benefit Plan Assets
Pension Plan Investment Strategy and Policy
The Pension Plans’ assets are invested in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants. 
Other objectives are to:
•
Provide a total return that, over the long term, provides sufficient assets to fund the pension plan liabilities subject to a level of risk, contributions and pension expense deemed appropriate by the company.
•
Minimize, where possible, pension expense volatility, and inclusion of liability driven investing as an investment strategy when appropriate. As the funding ratio improves, the objectives will evolve to minimize the funded status volatility.
•
Diversify investments within asset classes to reduce the impact of losses in single investments.
The assets of the Pension Plans are invested in compliance with ERISA, as amended, and any subsequent applicable regulations and laws.
Performance
Our performance objective is to outperform the return of weighing passive investment alternatives by the policy target allocations after fees at a comparable level of risk. This investment objective is expected to be achieved over the long term and is measured over rolling multi-year periods. Peer-relative performance comparisons will also be considered especially when performance deviates meaningfully from market indexes. Investment objectives for each asset class are included below.
Asset Allocation Policy 
Asset allocation policy is the principal method for achieving the Pension Plans' investment objectives stated above. 
The Pension Plans’ weighted average long-term strategic asset allocation policy targets are as follows:

Global equities are held for their long-term expected return premium over fixed income investments and inflation. Fixed income is held for diversification relative to equities, and as a hedging instrument to interest rate volatility for the pension obligation. Diversified Credit and Real Assets are held for diversification relative to equities and for income generation.
The strategic role of global equities is to:
•
Provide higher expected returns of the major asset classes.
•
Maintain a diversified exposure within global stock markets through the use of multi-manager portfolio strategies.
The strategic role of fixed income is to: 
•
Diversify the Pension Plans’ equity exposure by investing in fixed income securities that exhibit a low correlation to equities, thereby lowering the overall return volatility of the entire investment portfolio.
•
Maintain a diversified exposure within the U.S. fixed income market through the use of portfolio strategies targeting treasury bond exposures.

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY

(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
•
Hedge the interest rate risk of the pension obligation by investing in securities that target a similar duration to the pension obligation cash flows. 
The strategic role of diversified credit is to: 
•
Diversify the Pension Plans’ equity exposure by investing in alternative credit securities that exhibit a low correlation to equities, thereby lowering the overall return volatility of the entire investment portfolio. 
•
Maintain a diversified exposure within the alternative credit markets through the use of multi-manager portfolio strategies targeting, but not limited to, securitized credit, high yield securities, and emerging market debt. 
•
Achieve returns in excess of passive indexes through the use of active investment managers and strategies.
The strategic role of real assets is to:
•
Diversify the Pension Plans’ equity exposure by investing in real assets that exhibit a low correlation to equities, thereby lowering the overall return volatility of the entire investment portfolio. 
•
Maintain a diversified exposure within the real asset markets through the use of multi-manager portfolio strategies targeting listed and unlisted exposures.
•
Achieve returns in excess of passive indexes through the use of active investment managers and strategies.
The long-term strategic asset allocation policy is reviewed regularly or whenever significant changes occur to Century’s or the Pension Plans' financial position and liabilities.
Fair Value Measurements of Pension Plan assets
The following table sets forth by level the fair value hierarchy our Pension Plans' assets. These assets are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and the placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
As more fully described within 
Note 7. Fair Value Measurements
, the Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair values. The fair value hierarchy provides transparency regarding the inputs we use to measure fair value. We categorize each fair value measurement in its entirety into the following three levels, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement:
•
Level 1 Inputs – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 Inputs – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Our domestic Pension Plans’ assets are held in certain commingled funds and group trusts which do not have publicly quoted prices. The fair value of the commingled funds and group trusts is based on NAV of the underlying investments. The fair value of the underlying investments held by the commingled funds, separate accounts and common collective trusts is generally based on quoted prices in active markets. Though the Company believes the methods used to estimate fair value are consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of other methods or assumptions could result in a different estimate of fair value. Our foreign plan assets are held in bonds and equity securities which have publicly quoted prices.
Our other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded. We fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims.
Pension and OPEB Cash Flows

Participation in Multi-employer Pension Plans
The union-represented employees at Hawesville are part of a United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union ("USWA") sponsored multi-employer plan. Our contributions to the plan are determined at a fixed rate per hour worked. Currently, we do not have any plans to withdraw from or curtail participation in this plan. The risks of participating in a multi-employer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following respects:
•
Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.
•
If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
•
If a participating employer chooses to stop participating in a multi-employer plan, the employer may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.
Century’s participation in the plan for the year ended December 31, 2024, is outlined in the table below.

The zone status is based on information that Century received from the plan as well as publicly available information per the Department of Labor and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded.

Century 401(k) Plans
We sponsor a tax-deferred savings plan under which eligible domestic employees may elect to contribute specified percentages of their compensation with Century. We match a portion of participants' contributions to the savings plan. Employee and matching contributions are considered fully vested immediately upon participation in the plan. Concurrent with the 2014 amendment to the Salaried Pension Plan that eliminated future accruals for participants who are under age 
50
 as of January 1, 2015 and closed the plan to new entrants, the Company increased the proportional match of contributions made to those affected by the amendment. The expense related to the plan was $
6.3
 million, $
5.8
 million, and $
6.0
 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Share-based Compensation
Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan.
 Under our Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Incentive Plan") we award service-based and performance-based share awards and nonqualified stock options to our salaried officers, non-employee directors, and other key employees. Our service-based and performance-based share awards typically vest over a period of 
three years
 from the date of grant, provided that the recipient is still our employee at the time of vesting. Our independent non-employee directors receive annual grants of service-based share awards that typically vest following 
12
 months of service. The Stock Incentive Plan has 
12,900,000
 shares authorized for issuance with approximately 
2,673,311
 shares remaining at December 31, 2024.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
. We also grant annual long-term incentive awards under our Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"). The LTIP is designed to provide senior-level employees the opportunity to earn long-term incentive awards through the achievement of performance goals and to align compensation with the interests of our stockholders. This is achieved by linking compensation to share price appreciation and total stockholder return over a multi-year period. Awards made under the LTIP are granted subject to the Stock Incentive Plan to the extent the award is deliverable in stock. We provide 
two
 types of LTIP awards: restricted stock units ("RSU") and performance stock units ("PSU").
RSUs are stock-settled awards which do not contain any performance-based vesting requirements. PSUs can be settled in cash or stock and vest based on the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics at the discretion of the Board. Our PSU liability was approximately $
7.1
 million and $
3.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Both the PSUs and RSUs vest, in their entirety, after 
three years

Earnings Per Share
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.

%
The effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2024 was 
1.0
% compared to the statutory US tax rate of 21%. This lower effective rate is primarily due to the bargain purchase gain recognized for US GAAP purposes but not for US tax purposes, as well as the non-taxable benefit of the Advanced Manufacturing Credit under Section 45X, which is discussed below.
In August 2022, the IRA became law. The IRA provides several tax incentives to promote clean energy and the production of critical minerals in the U.S., including a refundable tax credit, pursuant to Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code. Tax credits, such as refundable credits whose realization does not depend on the entity’s generation of taxable income like the refundable tax credit provided by the IRA are not considered an element of income tax accounting under ASC 740. After considering US GAAP, the Company has concluded it is appropriate to apply IAS 20, 
Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance
, to account for the refundable tax credit as an income grant. 
Section 45X of the IRA contains a production tax credit equal to 10% of certain eligible production costs, including, without limitation, labor, energy, depreciation and amortization and overhead expenses. On December 14, 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed rules to provide guidance on the production tax credit requirements under Internal Revenue Code Section 45X (the “Proposed Regulations”). On October 24, 2024 the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final regulations regarding the advanced manufacturing production credit established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to incentivize the production of eligible components within the United States (the “Final Regulations”).
The Final Regulations provide guidance on rules that taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the Section 45X tax credit. One of the most significant changes from the Proposed Regulations is that the final regulations allow certain direct and indirect material costs to be included in the section 45X credit computation for the production of electrode active materials and critical minerals. Notably, with respect to all of the comments related to the definition of aluminum, the Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that additional consideration is necessary prior to finalizing proposed § 1.45X–4(b)(1), which the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to do at a later date. For that reason, § 1.45X–4(b)(1) is reserved in these Final Regulations. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recognized $
89.7
 million and $
56.5
 million as a reduction in Cost of goods sold, and $
2.9
 million and $
2.8
 million as a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a current manufacturing credit receivable of  $
81.5
 million and $
59.3
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a non-current manufacturing credit receivable  of  $
70.4
 million. There was 
no
 non-current manufacturing credit receivable recognized as of December 31, 2023 within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company’s accounting policy with respect to releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income is to apply a security by security approach whereby the tax effects are measured based on the change in the unrealized

We regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. When a valuation allowance is established or increased, an income tax charge is included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly. Future changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates and taxable income levels could result in actual realization of the deferred tax assets being materially different from the amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements. If the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated, we would be required to write-off the remaining deferred tax asset and increase the tax provision.
We have a valuation allowance of $
504.4
 million recorded against our net U.S. and Jamaican deferred tax assets, and a portion of our Icelandic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024. The Company is subject to the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, which requires that the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted.

Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future federal taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an "ownership change" as defined in the Code. In general, an ownership change would occur if our "five-percent shareholders," as defined under the Code, collectively increase their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Future transactions in our stock that may not be in our control may cause us to experience such an ownership change and thus limit our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits and other tax assets to offset future taxable income.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $
3.5
 million. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $
1.4
 million of the total as of December 31, 2024 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Company’s favor. Included in the above balances are tax positions relating to temporary differences where there is uncertainty about the timing of tax return inclusion, but not that the amounts will ultimately be tax deductible. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the timing would not impact the annual effective tax rate but could accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. We do not expect a significant change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. It is our policy to recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Century and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and several foreign jurisdictions.
Our federal income tax returns have been reviewed by the IRS through 2010. However, we have NOLs beginning in 2008 that are available for carryforward to future years. Under U.S. tax law, NOLs may be adjusted by the IRS until the statute of limitations expires for the year in which the NOL is used. Accordingly, our 2008 and later NOLs may be reviewed until they are used or expire. 
We are subject to examination by tax authorities according to statutory periods defined in each jurisdiction. The earliest statutory period open is beginning in 2019.
17.  
Commitments and Contingencies
We have pending against us or may be subject to various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial, stockholder, environmental, safety and health matters and are involved in other matters that may give rise to contingent liabilities. While the results of such matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the ultimate outcome of any such matters and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation and estimating liabilities, should 
94
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
the resolution or outcome of these actions be unfavorable, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.
In evaluating whether to accrue for losses associated with legal or environmental contingencies, it is our policy to take into consideration factors such as the facts and circumstances asserted, our historical experience with contingencies of a similar nature, the likelihood of our prevailing and the severity of any potential loss. For some matters, no accrual is established because we have assessed our risk of loss to be remote. Where the risk of loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual, either on an individual basis or with respect to a group of matters involving similar claims, based on the factors set forth above. While we regularly review the status of, and our estimates of potential liability associated with, contingencies to determine the adequacy of any associated accruals and related disclosures, the ultimate amount of loss may differ from our estimates.
Legal Contingencies 
Ravenswood Retiree Medical Benefits changes
In November 2009, Century Aluminum of West Virginia ("CAWV") filed a class action complaint for declaratory judgment against the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union ("USW"), the USW’s local and certain CAWV retirees, individually and as class representatives ("CAWV Retirees"), seeking a declaration of CAWV’s rights to modify/terminate retiree medical benefits. Later in November 2009, the USW and representatives of a retiree class filed a separate suit against CAWV, Century Aluminum Company, Century Aluminum Master Welfare Benefit Plan, and various John Does with respect to the foregoing. On August 18, 2017, the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia approved a settlement agreement in respect of these actions, pursuant to the agreement, CAWV agreed to make payments into a trust for the benefit of the CAWV Retirees in the aggregate amount of $
23.0
 million over the course of 
10
 years. Upon approval of the settlement, we paid $
5.0
 million to the aforementioned trust in September 2017 and recognized a gain of $
5.5
 million to arrive at the-then net present value of $
12.5
 million. CAWV has agreed to pay the remaining amounts under the settlement agreement in annual increments of $
2.0
 million for 
nine years
. As of December 31, 2024, 
$
2.0
 million
 was recorded in other current liabilities and $
1.6
 million was recorded in other liabilities.
PBGC Settlement
In 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ("the PBGC") regarding an alleged "cessation of operations" at our Ravenswood facility (the "PBGC Settlement Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the PBGC Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $
17.4
 million. Under certain circumstances, in periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations, we were able to defer one or more of these payments, provided that we provide the PBGC with acceptable security for such deferred payments. We historically elected to defer certain payments under the PBGC Settlement Agreement and provided the PBGC with the appropriate security. On October 1, 2021, we amended the PBGC Settlement Agreement (the "Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement") such that we removed the deferral mechanism and agreed to contribute approximately $
2.4
 million per year to our defined benefit pension plans for a total of approximately $
9.6
 million, over 
four years
 beginning o
n November 30, 
2022 and ending on
 November 30
, 2025, subject to acceleration if certain terms and conditions are met in such amendment. As of December 31, 2024, we have made contributions of $
7.2
 million related to the Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement.

Mt. Holly
Century Aluminum of South Carolina ("CASC") has a power supply agreement with Santee Cooper that has an effective term through December 2026. Under this power supply agreement, 
100
% of Mt. Holly’s electrical power requirements are supplied from Santee Cooper’s generation at cost of service based rates. 
Grundartangi 
Grundartangi has power purchase agreements for approximately 
545
 MW with HS Orka hf ("HS"), Landsvirkjun and Orkuveita Reykjavikur ("OR"). These power purchase agreements expire on various dates from 2026 through 2036 (subject to extension). The power purchase agreements with each of HS and OR provide power at LME-based variable rates for the duration of these agreements. The larger Landsvirkjun agreement provides for fixed rate with an additional variable rate linked to the LME. Grundartangi also has a separate 
25
 MW power purchase agreement with Landsvirkjun at an LME-based variable rate.
Other Commitments and Contingencies
Labor Commitments
The bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Vlissingen, Hawesville, Sebree and Jamalco facilities are represented by labor unions, representing approximately 
59
% of our total workforce.
Approximately

86
% of Grundartangi’s work force is represented by 
five
 labor unions, governed by a labor agreement that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees. This agreement was effective Through December 31, 2024. Grundartangi is currently in the process of negotiating a new contract. Until a new contract is reached, employees will continue to operate under the current agreement. 
100
% of Vlissingen’s workforce is represented by the Federation for the Metal and Electrical Industry ("FME"), a Netherlands' employers' organization for companies in the metal, electronics, electrical engineering and plastic sectors. The FME negotiates working conditions with trade unions on behalf of its members, which, when agreed upon, are then applicable to all employees of Vlissingen. The current labor agreement is effective Through December 31, 2025.
Approximately 
39
% of our U.S. based work force is represented by USW through separately negotiated labor agreements for each facility. The labor agreement for Hawesville employees is effective Through April 1, 2026. Upon announcement of the curtailment, Hawesville and the USW local union entered into effects bargaining. An agreement was reached on July 19, 2022, covering the curtailment period. Century Sebree's labor agreement with USW for its employees is effective through October 28, 2028. Mt. Holly employees are not represented by a labor union.
Approximately 
61
% of Jamalco's work force is represented by the Union of Technical, Administrative, and Supervisory Personnel ("UTASP") through separately labor agreements for hourly and salaried employee groups. Both contracts were effective through December 31, 2023. Jamalco is currently in the process of negotiating new contracts with both the salaried and hourly employee groups. Until new contracts are reached, employees will continue to operate under the current agreements. 
Contingent Obligation
We have a contingent obligation in connection with the “unwind” of a contractual arrangement between CAKY, Big Rivers Electric Corporation ("Big Rivers") and a third party and the execution of a long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy, a member of a cooperative of Big Rivers, in July 2009. This contingent obligation consists of the aggregate payments 
96
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
made to Big Rivers by the third party on CAKY’s behalf in excess of the agreed upon base amount under the long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy. As of December 31, 2024, the principal and accrued interest for the contingent obligation was $
32.3
 million, which was fully offset by a derivative asset. We may be required to make installment payments for the contingent obligation in the future. These payments are contingent based on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville’s operations. Interest accrues at an annual rate equal to 
10.94
%. As of December 31, 2024, the LME forward market prices do not exceed the threshold for payment. In addition, based on the current level of Hawesville's operations, including the curtailment, we believe that we will not be required to make payments on the contingent obligation during the term of the agreement, which expires in 2028. There can be no assurance that circumstances will not change thus accelerating the timing of such payments.

% interest in an alumina refinery joint venture. We are organized as a holding company with each of our operating primary aluminum smelters managed and operated as a separate facility reporting to our corporate headquarters. Our 
three
 operating primary aluminum smelters and our bauxite and alumina refinery each meet the definition of an operating segment We evaluated the similar economic and other characteristics, including similar products, production processes, customers and distribution and have aggregated our 
four
 operating segments into 
one
 reportable segment. In addition, all of our operating segments share several key economic factors inherent in their common products and production processes. For example, all of our facilities' revenue is based on market pricing. Our facilities have a similar customer base and utilize similar distribution methods to ship products. In 2024, we determined that our fully curtailed Hawesville facility no longer met the definition of an operating segment. Our chief executive officer is our chief operating decision maker (CODM) and evaluates performance based on Segment EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Specifically, the CODM reviews Segment EBITDA to develop forecasting and evaluate overall profitability performance.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 
no
 open fixed for floating swaps.
We previously entered into forward contracts to hedge the risk of fluctuations associated with the Icelandic Krona (ISK) and Euro for contracts related to the construction of the Grundartangi casthouse and the Sebree casthouse project denominated in these currencies ("casthouse currency hedges"). As of December 31, 2024, we had 
no
 open casthouse currency hedges.
We previously entered into financial contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure at our operations to the NYMEX Henry Hub (“NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price swaps”). The natural gas volume is measured per million British Thermal Units ("MMBtu"). As of December 31, 2024, we had 
no
 open NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price swaps.

Variable Interest Entity
The Company consolidates Jamalco, a bauxite mining and alumina refinery in Jamaica, under the variable interest entity ("VIE") model. The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, General Alumina Jamaica Limited, is the managing partner of the Jamalco joint venture. Jamalco lacks sufficient equity investment at risk in accordance with relevant guidance. Based on its purpose and design, Jamalco is expected to require additional subordinated financial support, such as those in the form of equity contributions or other forms of subordinated financing, which the Company expects would require parent guarantees. To that end, the Company made an immediate equity contribution to Jamalco upon acquisition, and has provided subsequent financing of costs for Jamalco to perform its activities in the ordinary course of business. Jamalco was designed in order to distribute operations risk related to the mining and alumina refining operations, as well as commodity price risk.

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)
Although our partner has certain participating rights over some decisions of the entity, the Company has power over the majority of key activities at Jamalco that significantly affect its economic performance over which the counterparty does not have such participating rights; therefore, the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
The table below shows the carrying amounts and classification of the consolidated VIE's assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
Not applicable.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2024, because of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting below.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system of internal control contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.
As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. Management’s evaluation was based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our system of internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to the material weaknesses described below. 
1 - The Company failed to design and implement appropriate information technology general controls in the areas of logical access controls including provisioning, deprovisioning, privileged access, user access review, application changes and monitoring related to Jamalco.
2 - The Company failed to design and implement appropriate business process level controls, including controls to address the completeness and accuracy of information derived from its affected information technology systems at Jamalco, which resulted in a material weakness related to reconciliation controls and insufficient review controls related to inventories, accounts payable, accrued expenses, cost of goods sold and property, plant, and equipment.
Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses
Management plans to implement measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions for general information technology controls include:(i) designing and implementing controls related to deprovisioning, privileged access, and user access reviews, (ii) developing an enhanced risk assessment process to evaluate and monitor system changes, and (iii) providing training associated with control design and execution.
The remediation actions for business process controls include: (i) designing and implementing controls related to account reconciliations (ii) improving the accuracy of supporting schedules underlying transactions, and (iii) timely capitalization of 
102
fixed assets. Additionally, we expect our remediation efforts to involve implementing additional controls to address the completeness and accuracy of information utilized in business process controls.
We believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
Previously Reported Material Weakness
As of December 31, 2023, our management had identified a deficiency in the design of internal control over financial reporting related to the application of purchase accounting to our acquisition of Jamalco. The design deficiency was determined to be a material weakness related to the review of the Company's allocation of excess fair value acquired between non-controlling interest and preliminary deferred bargain purchase gain. In response to the identified material weakness above, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, took actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in the first quarter of 2024. We changed the design of our internal controls over financial reporting to include a review of the allocation of the excess fair value of the net assets acquired at an entity level. We completed our assessment of the redesigned control related to the application of purchase accounting to determine if it was designed and operating effectively for all adjustments made during the three months ended March 31, 2024 in finalizing our purchase accounting. As a result of our assessment, management concluded that the material weakness associated with the application of purchase accounting was remediated as of March 31, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
On May 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Jamaica Holdings, Inc., completed the acquisition of all the outstanding share capital of General Alumina Holdings Limited, the holder of a 55% interest in Jamalco JV ("Jamalco"), an unincorporated joint venture engaged in bauxite mining and alumina production in Jamaica. Except for the remediation efforts related to the previous material weakness referred to above, during the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction & Syria Human Rights Act 
Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA”), effective August 10, 2012, added a new subsection (r) to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers that file periodic reports with the SEC to disclose in their annual and quarterly reports whether, during the reporting period, they or any of their “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to Iran, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable laws. Issuers must also file a notice with the SEC if any disclosable activity under ITRA has been included in an annual or quarterly report.
Because the SEC defines the term “affiliate” broadly, our largest stockholder may be considered an affiliate of the Company despite the fact that the Company has no control over its largest stockholder’s actions or the actions of its affiliates. As such, pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Exchange Act, the Company hereby discloses the following information provided by our largest stockholder regarding transactions or dealings with entities controlled by the Government of Iran (“the GOI”):
During the year ended December 31, 2024, non-U.S. affiliates of the largest stockholder of the Company (“the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates”) entered into sales contracts for agricultural products with, or for delivery to or from Iranian entities wholly or majority owned by the GOI. The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates performed their obligations under the contracts in compliance with applicable sanction laws and, where required, with the necessary prior approvals by the relevant governmental authorities.
The gross revenue of the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates related to the contracts did not exceed the value of USD $426 million

for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates do not allocate net profit on a country-by-country or activity-by-activity basis, but estimate that the net profit attributable to the contracts would not exceed a small fraction of the 
103
gross revenue from such contracts. It is not possible to determine accurately the precise net profit attributable to such contracts.
The contracts disclosed above do not violate applicable sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, and are not the subject of any enforcement action under Iran sanction laws.
The non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates expect to continue to engage in similar activities in the future in compliance with applicable economic sanctions and in conformity with U.S. secondary sanctions.
The Company and its global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under ITRA, nor were we involved in the transactions described in this section. As of the date of this report, the Company is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by it or any of its affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2024 that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
During the fourth quarter of 2024, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers 
adopted
 or 
terminated
 any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
