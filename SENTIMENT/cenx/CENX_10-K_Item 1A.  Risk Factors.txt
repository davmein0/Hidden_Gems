Risk Related to our Industry and Business 
Declines in overall aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum which can be volatile and subject to many factors beyond our control. The overall price of primary aluminum consists of three components: (i) the base commodity price, which is based on quoted prices on the LME; plus (ii) any regional premium (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe); plus (iii) any value-added product premium. Each of these three components has its own drivers of variability. 
The price of aluminum is influenced by a number of factors, including global supply-demand balance, inventory levels, speculative activities by market participants, production activities by global producers, political and economic conditions including the implementation and modifications of tariff regimes, as well as raw material and other production costs in major production regions. These factors can be highly speculative and difficult to predict which can lead to significant volatility in the price of aluminum. A deterioration in global economic conditions or a regional or worldwide financial downturn may also adversely affect future demand and prices for aluminum. Geopolitical uncertainty of any kind (including an outbreak or escalation of a regional conflict, such as the current situation in Ukraine or the hostilities in the Middle East), 
major public health issues (such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic like COVID-19) or other unexpected events 
have the potential to negatively impact business confidence, potentially resulting in reduced global or regional demand for aluminum

and increased price volatility. Such events may also impact prices by causing disruptions in our operations, supply chain, or workforce.
Declines in aluminum prices could cause us to curtail production at our operations or take other actions to reduce our cost of production, including deferring certain capital expenditures and maintenance costs and implementing workforce reductions. Any deferred costs achieved through such curtailments and other cost cutting measures could ultimately result in higher capital expenditures and maintenance costs than would have been incurred had such costs not been deferred and increase the costs to 
10
restore production capacity if market forces warrant. Declines in aluminum prices also negatively impact our liquidity by lowering our borrowing availability under our asset-based revolving credit facilities (due to a lower market value of our inventory and accounts receivable). These factors may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.
Excess capacity and overproduction of aluminum may materially disrupt global aluminum markets causing price deterioration which, in turn, could adversely impact our operating results, sales, margins and profitability.
Prior to 2021, global aluminum prices had been significantly depressed primarily due to large amounts of excess capacity and overproduction in China and other regions. Significant portions of global aluminum production would not be possible during such times without financial and other support and incentives from governments and state-owned entities. This oversupply caused global aluminum prices to be adversely impacted. Supply and demand in the aluminum market began to balance in 2021, however there is a risk that the market could again be saturated with excess capacity and overproduction. Overproduction and the export of heavily subsidized aluminum products may result in depressed prices and, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our operating results, sales, margins and profitability.
Increases in energy costs may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Electrical power represents one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. As a result, the availability of electricity at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations.
In the U.S., our Hawesville and Sebree plants receive all of their electricity requirements under market-based electricity contracts. These market-based contracts expose us to price volatility and fluctuations due to factors beyond our control and without any direct relationship to the price of primary aluminum. For example, extreme weather events throughout 2022 across the United States resulted in increases to power prices for our Kentucky plants, which resulted in the curtailment of the Hawesville smelter in the third quarter of 2022. More recently, market disruptions in global energy markets related to the war in Ukraine caused significant increases in market-based power prices. Market-based electricity contracts expose us to market price volatility and fluctuations driven by, among other things, coal and natural gas prices, renewable energy production, regulatory changes and weather events, in each case, without any direct relationship to the price of primary aluminum. There can be no assurance that our market-based power supply arrangements will result in favorable electricity costs. Any increase in our electricity and energy prices not tied to corresponding increases in the LME price could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Loss or disruptions in our supply of power and other power-related events could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
We use large amounts of electricity to produce primary aluminum. Any loss or disruption of the power supply which reduces the amperage to our equipment or causes an equipment shutdown would result in a reduction in the volume of molten aluminum produced, and prolonged losses of power may result in the hardening or "freezing" of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced, which could require an expensive and time consuming restart process, if a restart is possible at all.
Disruptions in the supply of electrical power to our facilities can be caused by a number of circumstances, including, but not limited to, unusually high demand, blackouts, equipment or transformer failure, human error, malicious acts including cyber-attacks or domestic terrorism, natural disasters, weather events or other catastrophic events. Our market-based power supply arrangements further increase the risk th
at disruptions in the supply of electrical power to our domestic operations could occur. Under these arrangements, we have greater exposure to transmission line outages, problems with grid stability and limitations on energy import capability. An alternative supply of power in the event of a disruption may not be feasible. If events such as the above occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.
Power disruptions have had a material negative impact on our results of operations in the past. We operate our smelters at close to peak amperage. Accordingly, even partial failures of high voltage equipment could affect our production. Disruptions in the supply of electrical power that do not result in production curtailment could cause us to experience pot instability that could decrease levels of productivity and incur losses.
We maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events, but are required to pay significant amounts under the deductible and self-insured retention provisions of those insurance policies. In addition, the coverage under those policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses, or may not cover certain events. Certain of 
11
our insurance policies do not cover any losses that may be incurred if our suppliers are unable to provide power under certain circumstances. Certain losses or prolonged interruptions in our operations may trigger a default under certain of our outstanding indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
We may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate.
The global primary aluminum industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Aluminum also competes with other materials, such as steel, copper, plastics, composite materials and glass, among others, for various applications and uses. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and technical resources than we do. These larger competitors may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions. Similarly, many of our competitors may receive various subsidies from local, state and federal governments and have vertically integrated upstream operations with resulting superior cost positions to ours and may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions, including inflationary impacts. If we are not able to compete successfully, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
Curtailment of aluminum production at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
The continued operation of our smelters depends on the market for primary aluminum and our underlying costs of production. There can be no assurance that future deterioration in the price of aluminum or increases in our costs of production, including power, will not result in additional production curtailments at our smelters.
Curtailing production requires us to incur substantial expenses, both at the time of the curtailment and on an ongoing basis. Our facilities are subject to contractual and other fixed costs that continue even if we curtail operations at these facilities. These costs reduce the cost saving advantages of curtailing unprofitable aluminum production. If we are unable to realize the intended cost saving effects of any production curtailment, we may have to seek bankruptcy protection or be forced to divest some or all of our assets. The process of restarting production following curtailment is also expensive, time consuming and labor-intensive and there is no guarantee that once a curtailment has occurred that the plant will ever return to operation. As a result, any decision to restart production would likely require market conditions significantly better than the market conditions at the time the decision to curtail was made. Any curtailments of our operations, or actions taken to seek bankruptcy protection or divest some or all of our assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
The restart of curtailed capacity at our Mt. Holly smelter is subject to certain risks and uncertainties.
In late 2023, we finalized a new power agreement with Santee Cooper at our Mt. Holly smelter which provides access to sufficient energy to potentially allow Mt. Holly to restart the remaining 25% of its curtailed production capacity. Any potential future restart of this curtailed capacity will be made in the context of then-current market conditions that are subject to risks outside of our control, specifically the LME price of aluminum, price and availability of raw materials and price levels of metal premiums. Changes in these inputs may result in actual costs and returns that materially differ from the estimated costs and returns and our financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected as a result. Changes in these inputs may also affect the economic viability of restarting the remaining curtailed capacity at Mt. Holly.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to restart the 25% of Mt. Holly's production that remains curtailed within a projected budget and schedule. In addition to changes in market assumptions, other unforeseen difficulties could increase the cost of a restart, delay a restart or render a restart not feasible. Our ability to finance a restart could also be impacted by our cash position and results of operations. Any delay in the completion of such a project, unexpected or increased costs or inability to fund a restart could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Future options with respect to our Hawesville smelter remain subject to strategic review.
In the third quarter of 2022, we curtailed all operations at our Hawesville smelter. We continue to explore all options related to the Hawesville smelter and have engaged financial advisors and launched a formal process to evaluate strategic alternatives and potential value to help us in our overall evaluation of this asset.

There can be no assurance that we will decide to sell Hawesville, that we will be able to sell Hawesville on commercially attractive terms, or at all, or that if we elect to restart Hawesville, that such restarted operations would be profitable. 
12
Any potential future restart of operations at the Hawesville smelter will be made in the context of then-current market conditions that are subject to risks outside of our control, specifically the LME price of aluminum, price and availability of raw materials and price levels of metal premiums. Changes in these inputs may result in actual costs and returns that materially differ from the estimated costs and returns and our financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected as a result. Changes in these inputs may also make the restart of Hawesville operations uneconomic.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to restore Hawesville to full production within a projected budget and schedule. In addition to changes in market assumptions, other unforeseen difficulties could increase the cost of a restart, delay the restart or render the restart not feasible. Our ability to finance the restart could also be impacted by our cash position and results of operations. Any delay in the completion of the project, unexpected or increased costs or inability to fund the restart could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Increases in our raw material costs and disruptions in our supply of raw materials could adversely affect our business
.
Our business depends upon the adequate supply of alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, pitch, carbon anodes, cathodes, alloys, caustic soda, natural gas, heavy fuel oil, and other raw materials. For some of these production inputs, such as coke, pitch and cathodes, we do not have any internal production and rely on a limited number of suppliers for all of our requirements. Many of our supply agreements are short term or expire in the next few years. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew such agreements on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Certain of our principal raw materials are commodities for which, at times, availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflationary impacts, domestic and worldwide demand, labor costs, competition, weather conditions and other transportation delays, major force majeure events, pandemics, tariffs, sanctions and currency exchange rates. Because we rely on a limited number of suppliers, if our suppliers cannot meet their contracted volume commitments or other contractual requirements, it may be difficult for us to source our raw materials from alternative suppliers at commercially reasonable prices or within the time periods required by our operations, if at all. If we are unable to source from alternative suppliers, we could be forced to curtail production or use raw materials that do not meet our requirements, which could cause inefficiencies in our operations, increase costs or impact our production capabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
We are also exposed to price risk for each of these raw material commodities. For example, from time to time we may enter into alumina supply contracts that are based on a published alumina index. As a result, our cost structure may be exposed to market fluctuations and price volatility. During 2024, for example, external events in the alumina markets, including the export ban in Guinea, caused significant price volatility. As a result of these events, the alumina index price reached a high of $805 per tonne in December 2024 compared to an average price of $343 per tonne in 2023 and $
362
 per tonne for 2022. From time to time, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in our alumina costs by purchasing certain of our alumina requirements under supply contracts with prices tied to the LME price of aluminum.
Because we sell our products based on published market prices, we are not able to pass on to our customers any increased cost of raw materials that are not linked to such prices. The availability of our raw materials at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations and increases in pricing and/or disruptions in our supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
We may be unable to realize expected benefits of our capital projects.
From time to time, we undertake strategic capital projects in order to enhance, expand and/or upgrade our facilities and operational capabilities. For instance, within the past several years, we have undertaken expansion projects at each of our Jamalco, Sebree, Grundartangi, Mt. Holly and Vlissingen facilities. Our ability to complete these projects and the timing and costs of doing so are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, the start-up of operations after such projects have been completed is also subject to risk. Our ability to achieve the anticipated increased revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on these investments is subject to a variety of market, operational, regulatory and labor-related factors. For example, we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our recent investments in Hawesville because of the curtailment of that facility in the third quarter of 2022 due to historically high energy costs and declining LME prices. Any failure to complete these projects, or any delays or failure to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of any such projects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
13
Certain of our raw material and services contracts contain "take-or-pay" obligations.
We have obligations under certain contracts to take-or-pay for specified raw materials or services over the term of those contracts regardless of our operating requirements. To the extent that we curtail production at any of our operations, we may continue to be obligated to take or pay for goods or services under these contracts as if we were operating at full production, which reduces the cost savings advantages of curtailing production. Our financial position and results of operations may also be adversely affected by the market price for such materials or services as we will continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet or settle our contractual take-or-pay obligations. If we were unable to use such materials or services in our operations or sell them at prices consistent with or greater than our contract costs, we could incur significant losses under these contracts. In addition, these commitments may also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for such materials and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
We have historically derived substantially all of our revenue from a small number of customers, and we could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or changes in the business or financial condition of our major customers.
We have historically derived substantially all of our consolidated net sales from a small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we derived approximately 59.1% of our consolidated net sales from Glencore and we currently have agreements in place to sell a substantial portion of our 2025 production to Glencore. We expect that the rest of our 2025 customer base will remain fairly concentrated among a small number of customers under short-term contracts. See
