Item 2. Properties
Our principal executive office is located at 1 South Wacker Drive, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60606. We own and operate aluminum smelters in the United States and Iceland. We also own a carbon anode production facility located in the Netherlands and hold a 55% interest in a bauxite mining and alumina refining facility in Jamaica. We lease certain of our facilities under long-term operating leases, however, we do not believe that this fact materially affects the continued use of these properties. We believe all of our facilities are suitable and adequate for our current operations. Our significant properties are listed below.
