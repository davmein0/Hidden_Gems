our ability to commercialize our technologies;
•
the failure of the markets for our current or new technologies to materialize to the extent or at the rate that we expect;
•
our continued ability to develop new technologies and secure new patents, including the risk of unexpected delays or difficulties related to the development of our technologies;

•
risks related to any new accounting standards or our assumptions and application of relevant accounting standards, including with respect to revenue recognition.
You should carefully consider these factors as well as the risks and uncertainties outlined in greater detail in Part I, Item 1A, of this Form 10-K before making any investment decision with respect to our common stock. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expected and historical results.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments
The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time capturing a market rate of return.  To achieve these objectives, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, including government obligations, corporate bonds, and commercial paper.
Interest Rate Risk —
 We invest our cash in a number of diversified high quality investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities with a fair value of $982.4 million as of December 31, 2024.  Our exposure to interest rate risks is not significant due to the short average maturity, quality and diversification of our holdings.  We do not hold any derivative, derivative commodity instruments, or other similar financial instruments in our investment portfolio.  The risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is generally limited to our investment portfolio.  We believe that a hypothetical 10% change in period-end interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows.
The following table provides information about our interest-bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2024.  The table presents principal cash flows, weighted-average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates.  Additionally, we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes.

Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.
Bank Liquidity Risk —
 As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $535.7 million in operating accounts that are held with domestic and international financial institutions.  The majority of these balances are held with domestic financial institutions.  While we monitor daily cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be lost or become inaccessible if the underlying financial institutions fail or if they are unable to meet the liquidity requirements of their depositors.  We have not incurred any losses and have had full access to our operating accounts to date.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk —
 We are exposed to limited risk from fluctuations in currencies, which might change over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.  We operate and invest globally.  Adverse movements in currency exchange rates might negatively affect our business due to a number of situations.  Currently, our international licensing agreements are typically made in U.S. dollars and are generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk.  We do not engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions at this time.
Between 2014 and 2024, we paid approximately $141.9 million in foreign taxes to foreign governments that have tax treaties with the U.S., for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our U.S. tax obligations, and for which the tax treaty procedures are still open.  It is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures, the U.S. government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits.  Due to foreign currency fluctuations, any such agreement could result in foreign currency gain or loss. If the matter had been resolved as of December 31, 2024, we would have recognized a loss up to $22.8 million based on exchange rates and prior competent authority resolutions.

Table of Contents
Investment Risk —
 We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our short-term and long-term investments in addition to the liquidity and creditworthiness of the underlying issuers of our investments. We hold a diversified investment portfolio, which includes, fixed and floating-rate, investment-grade marketable securities, mortgage and asset-backed securities and U.S. government and other securities. The instruments included in our portfolio meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. This policy also limits our amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument.  Given that the guidelines of our investment policy prohibit us from investing in anything but highly rated instruments, our investments are not subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates for such securities. Our marketable securities, consisting of government obligations, corporate bonds and commercial paper, are primarily classified as available-for-sale with a fair value of $446.7 million as of December 31, 2024.
Equity Risk —
 We are exposed to changes in the market-traded price of our common stock as it influences the calculation of earnings per share. In connection with the offering of the 2027 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties. We also sold warrants to the option counterparties. These transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders' equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the 2027 Notes. The warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the 2027 Notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or convertible 2027 Notes.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of InterDigital, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of InterDigital, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition – Determination of Standalone Selling Prices of Identified Performance Obligations in Dynamic Fixed-Fee License Agreements Entered Into During The Year
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, dynamic fixed-fee license agreements include fixed, non-refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee’s obligations to the Company under a patent license agreement for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement. Total recurring revenues and catch-up revenues were $408 million and $460 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024, of which a significant portion relates to dynamic fixed-fee agreements entered into during the year. As disclosed by management, the process for determining the value of the standalone selling prices of identified performance obligations in dynamic fixed-fee license agreements requires the exercise of significant judgment when evaluating the valuation methods and assumptions, including the assumed royalties, projected sales volumes, discount rate, identification of comparable market transactions which are not directly observable and other relevant factors.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the determination of standalone selling prices of identified performance obligations in dynamic fixed-fee license agreements entered into during the year is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the value of standalone selling prices of identified performance obligations in dynamic fixed-fee license agreements and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to assumed royalties and projected sales volumes.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of standalone selling prices of identified performance obligations in dynamic fixed-fee license agreements. These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of dynamic fixed-fee license agreements (i) reading agreements entered into during the year; (ii) testing management’s process for determining the value of standalone selling prices of identified performance obligations; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods used; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management in the valuation methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to assumed royalties and projected sales volumes. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to assumed royalties and projected sales volumes involved considering consistency with historical sales data.
Revenue Recognition – Determination of the Amount of Consideration in Certain Arrangements with Variable Consideration
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, for certain patent license arrangements or other contractual arrangements, the amount of consideration that the Company will receive is uncertain. In such cases, management estimates and recognizes licensing revenues only when the Company has a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance. Such estimates are only recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur. Total recurring revenues and catch-up revenues were $408 million and $460 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024, of which a portion relates to certain arrangements with variable consideration. Management analyzes the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrains the amount of estimated revenues in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts management expects the Company is most likely to receive. As disclosed by management, these estimates may require significant judgment.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the determination of the amount of consideration in certain arrangements with variable consideration is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the amount of consideration and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions and judgments in determining the amount of consideration, including the analysis of the probability that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of the amount of consideration in certain arrangements with variable consideration. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading certain arrangements applicable for the current year; (ii) testing management’s process for determining the amount of consideration in such arrangements; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s analysis used in determining the amount of consideration; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used by management in the analysis; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions and judgments in determining the amount of consideration, including the analysis of the probability that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions and judgments in determining the amount of consideration, including the analysis of the probability that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues will not occur, involved considering management’s past experience in such arrangements, status of ongoing discussions with the customer, and advice obtained, including obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry from in-house and external legal counsel.

INTERDIGITAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2024 
1.
BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
InterDigital, Inc. ("InterDigital") is a global research and development company focused primarily on wireless, video, artificial intelligence ("AI"), and related technologies. We design and develop foundational technologies that enable connected, immersive experiences in a broad range of communications and entertainment products and services. We license our innovations worldwide to companies providing such products and services, including makers of wireless communications devices, consumer electronics, internet of things ("IoT") devices, cars and other motor vehicles and providers of cloud-based services such as video streaming. As a leader in wireless technology, our engineers have designed and developed a wide range of innovations that are used in wireless products and networks, from the earliest digital cellular systems to 5G and today's most advanced Wi-Fi technologies. We are also a leader in video processing and video encoding/decoding technology used in video-enabled products and services. Our AI research effort is focused on the intersection of AI with both wireless and video technologies. 
Principles of Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of our accounts and all entities in which we have a controlling interest and/or are required to be consolidated in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and therefore required to consolidate, we apply a qualitative approach that determines whether we have both the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity.  These considerations impact the way we account for our existing collaborative relationships and other arrangements.  We continuously assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as changes to existing relationships or future transactions may result in us consolidating or deconsolidating our partner(s) to collaborations and other arrangements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  If different assumptions were made or different conditions had existed, our financial results could have been materially different.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of substantially all of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.  Certain subsidiaries have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is different than the functional currency.  The gains and losses resulting from this remeasurement and translation of monetary assets denominated in a currency that is different than the functional currency are reflected in the determination of net income.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Marketable Securities
We classify all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase as cash equivalents.  Cash that is held for a specific purpose and therefore not available to the Company for immediate or general business use is classified as restricted cash.  Our investments are comprised of mutual and exchange traded funds, commercial paper, United States and municipal government obligations and corporate securities.  Management determines the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of acquisition and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our marketable securities have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported net-of-tax as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.  Substantially all of our investments are investment grade government and corporate debt securities that have maturities of less than 
three years
, and we have both the ability and intent to hold the investments until maturity.

Other-than-Temporary Impairments
We review our investment portfolio during each reporting period to determine whether there are identified events or circumstances that would indicate there is a decline in the fair value that is considered to be other-than-temporary.  For non-public investments, if there are no identified events or circumstances that would have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, then the fair value is not estimated.  If an investment is deemed to have experienced an other-than-temporary decline below its cost basis, we reduce the carrying amount of the investment to its quoted or estimated fair value, as applicable, and establish a new cost basis for the investment.  We charge the impairment to the "
Other income (expense), net"
 line of our consolidated statements of income.
Intangible Assets
Patents
We capitalize external costs, such as filing fees and associated attorney fees, incurred to obtain issued patents and patent license rights.  We expense costs associated with maintaining and defending patents subsequent to their issuance in the period incurred.  We amortize capitalized patent costs for internally generated patents on a straight-line basis over 
10
 years, which represents the estimated useful lives of the patents.  The 
ten-year
 estimated useful life for internally generated patents is based on our assessment of such factors as: the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed, the overall makeup of the portfolio over time, and the length of license agreements for such patents.  The estimated useful lives of acquired patents and patent rights, however, have been and will continue to be based on a separate analysis related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of internally generated patents.  The average estimated useful life of acquired patents is 
9.8
 years.  We assess the potential impairment to all capitalized net patent costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our patent portfolio may not be recoverable.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired under a business combination.  We review impairment of goodwill annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or if circumstances indicate a triggering event has occurred.  We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we need not perform the quantitative assessment.
60
Table of Contents
If based on the qualitative assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment test is required to be performed.  This assessment requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value including allocated goodwill.  We determine the fair value of our reporting units generally using a combination of the income and market approaches.  The income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flow method based on assumptions about future conditions such as future revenue growth rates, new product and technology introductions, gross margins, operating expenses, discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and other assumptions.  The market approach estimates the fair value of our equity by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue multiples from comparable companies in similar lines of business.  If the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference up to the carrying value of goodwill.
The carrying value of goodwill was $
22.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which was included within "
Other non-current assets, net
" in the consolidated balance sheets.  
No
 impairments were recorded during 2024, 2023 or 2022 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment assessment.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less depreciation, amortization, and impairments.  Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are provided using the straight-line method.  The estimated useful lives for computer equipment, computer software, engineering and test equipment, and furniture and fixtures are generally 
three
 to 
five years
.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or their respective lease terms, which are generally 
five
 to 
ten years
.  Buildings are being depreciated over 
twenty-five years
.  Expenditures for major improvements and betterments are capitalized, while minor repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Upon the retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use an incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease right-of-use assets also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are accounted for using the practical expedient which allows for straight-line rent expense over the remaining term of the lease.

Internal-Use Software Costs
We capitalize costs associated with software developed for internal use that are incurred during the software development stage.  Such costs are limited to expenses incurred after management authorizes and commits to a computer software project, believes that it is more likely than not that the project will be completed, the software will be used to perform the intended function with an estimated service life of 
two years
 or more, and the completion of conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives (the preliminary design stage).  Costs incurred after final acceptance testing has been successfully completed are expensed.  Capitalized computer software costs are amortized over their estimated useful life of 
three years
. 
All computer software costs capitalized to date relate to the purchase, development and implementation of engineering, accounting and other enterprise software.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when factors indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  When factors indicate that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we review whether we will be able to realize our long-lived assets by analyzing the projected undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.
61
Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition
We derive the vast majority of our revenue from patent licensing. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depend upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations.  Such agreements are often complex and include multiple performance obligations. These agreements can include, without limitation, performance obligations related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities, patent and/or know-how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees, access to a portfolio of technology as it exists at a point in time, and access to a portfolio of technology at a point in time along with promises to provide any technology updates to the portfolio during the term.
In accordance with GAAP, we use a five-step model to achieve the core underlying principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. These steps include (1) identifying the contract with the customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligation(s). Additionally, we have elected to utilize certain practical expedients in the application of ASC 606. In evaluating the presence of a significant financing component in our agreements, we utilize the practical expedient to exclude any contracts wherein the gap between payment by our customers and the delivery of our performance obligation is less than one year.  We have also elected to utilize the practical expedient related to costs of obtaining a contract where an entity may recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Timing of revenue recognition may differ significantly from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are included in accounts receivable and represent unbilled amounts expected to be received from customers in future periods, where the revenue recognized to date exceeds the amount billed, and right to payment is subject to the underlying contractual terms. Contract assets are classified as long-term assets if the payments are expected to be received more than one year from the reporting date. Contract assets due within less than twelve months of the balance sheet date are included within accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Contract assets due more than twelve months after the balance sheet date are included within other non-current assets. 
For certain patent license agreements or other contractual arrangements, the amount of consideration that we will receive is uncertain.  In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance. Such estimates are only recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts we expect we are most likely to receive. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.  
Patent License Agreements
Upon signing a patent license agreement, we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications. We account for patent license agreements in accordance with the guidance indicated above. 
Certain patent license agreements contain revenue from non-financial sources in the form of patents received from the customer. Under our patent license agreements, we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products. 
Consideration for Past Patent Royalties
Consideration related to a licensee’s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement. We may also receive consideration for past patent royalties in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement. In each of these cases, we record the consideration as revenue as prescribed by the five-step model. 
Fixed-Fee Agreements
Fixed-fee license agreements include fixed, non-refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee’s obligations to us under a patent license agreement for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement for specified products, under certain patents or patent claims, for sales in certain countries, or a combination thereof - in each case for a specified time period (including for the life of the patents licensed under the agreement). 
62
Table of Contents
Dynamic fixed-fee license agreements
 contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of technology over the license term, since our promise to transfer to the licensee access to the portfolio as it exists at inception of the license, along with promises to provide any technology updates to the portfolio during the term, are not separately identifiable. Upon entering a new agreement, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations delivered at signing (e.g. our existing patent portfolio) and future performance obligations (e.g. the technology updates). We use a time-based input method of progress to determine the timing of revenue recognition, and as such we recognize the future deliverables on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. We utilize the straight-line method as we believe that it best depicts efforts expended to develop and transfer updates to the customer evenly throughout the term of the agreement. 
Static fixed-fee license agreements
 are fixed-price contracts that generally do not include updates to technology we create after the inception of the license agreement or in which the customer does not stand to substantively benefit from those updates during the term. Although we have few static fixed-fee license agreements, we generally satisfy our performance obligations under such agreements at contract signing, and, as such, revenue is recognized at that time. 
Variable Agreements
Upon entering a new variable patent license agreement, the licensee typically agrees to pay royalties or license fees on licensed products sold during the term of the agreement. We utilize the sales- or usage- based royalty exception for these agreements and recognize revenues during the contract term when the underlying sale or usage occurs.  Our licensees under variable agreements provide us with quarterly royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us. We typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees’ underlying sales occurred. As a result, we are required to estimate revenues and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Estimating licensees’ quarterly royalties prior to receiving the royalty reports requires us to make assumptions and judgments related to forecasted trends and growth rates used to estimate our licensees’ sales, which could have an impact on the amount of revenue we report on a quarterly basis. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees’ sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Our accounts receivable consists mainly of trade receivables derived from fixed-fee license arrangements with contractual payment terms. The remaining material amounts of our accounts receivable are from variable patent license agreements, which primarily are paid on a quarterly basis. The provision for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts of future economic conditions. Further, we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and if there is doubt that we will collect the full amount, we will record a reserve specific to that customer’s receivable balance.
 There was 
no
 provision for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Investments in Other Entities
We may make strategic investments in companies that have developed or are developing technologies that are complementary to our business.  We made an accounting policy election for a measurement alternative for our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, specifically related to our strategic investments in other entities.  Under the alternative, our strategic investments in other entities without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, if any.  On a quarterly basis, we monitor items such as our investment’s financial position and liquidity, performance targets, business plans, and cost trends to assess whether there are any triggering events or indicators present that would be indicative of an impairment, or any other observable price changes as indicated above.  We do not adjust our investment balance when the investee reports profit or loss.

Table of Contents
Additionally, other investments may be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Under this method, we initially record our investment in the stock of an investee at cost, and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition.  The amount of the adjustment is included in the determination of net income, and such amount reflects adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated statements including adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses, and to amortize, if appropriate, any difference between our cost and underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment.  The investment is also adjusted to reflect our share of changes in the investee’s capital.  Dividends received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.  When there are a series of operating losses by the investee or when other factors indicate that a decrease in value of the investment has occurred which is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of our investment.  
The carrying value of our investments in other entities is included within "
Other non-current assets, net
" on our consolidated balance sheets.
  The carrying value of our investments in other entities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
19.9
 million and $
31.9
 million and, respectively, the majority of which are accounted for under the measurement alternative for equity investments described above.
Collaborative Arrangements
We record the elements of our collaboration agreements that represent joint operating activities in accordance with ASC 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 (“ASC 808”).  Accordingly, the elements of our collaboration agreements that represent activities in which both parties are active participants, and to which both parties are exposed to the significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of the activities, are recorded as collaborative arrangements.  Generally, the classification of a transaction under a collaborative arrangement is determined based on the nature and contractual terms of the arrangement along with the nature of the operations of the participants.  For transactions that are deemed to be a collaborative arrangement under ASC 808, costs incurred and revenues generated on sales to third parties will be reported in our consolidated statement of operations on a gross basis if the Company is deemed to be the principal in the transaction, or on a net basis if the Company is instead deemed to be the agent in the transaction, consistent with the guidance in ASC 606-10-55-36, 
Revenue From Contracts with Customers - Principal Agent Considerations
.
Deferred Charges 
Direct costs of obtaining a contract or fulfilling a contract in a transaction that results in the deferral of revenue may be either expensed as incurred or capitalized, depending on certain criteria.  We made a policy election to utilize the practical expedient related to costs of obtaining a contract where an entity may recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.  If the amortization period is greater than one year, we capitalize direct costs incurred for the acquisition or fulfillment of a contract through the date of signing if they are directly related to a particular revenue arrangement and are expected to be recovered.  The costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the patent license agreement. 
For example, from time to time, we use sales agents to assist us in our licensing and/or patent sale activities.  In such cases, we may pay a commission.  The commission rate varies from agreement to agreement.  Commissions are normally paid shortly after our receipt of cash payments associated with the patent license or patent sale agreements.  We defer recognition of commission expense and amortize these expenses in proportion to our recognition of the related revenue.  Commission expense is included within the "
Licensing"
 line of our consolidated statements of income and was immaterial for the years presented.
Incremental direct costs incurred related to a debt financing transaction may be capitalized.  In connection with our offering of the 2027 Notes and 2024 Notes, defined and discussed in detail within Note 10, "
Obligations"
, we incurred directly related costs. The debt issuance costs of the debt were capitalized as deferred financing costs and recorded as a direct reduction of the debt.  These costs are being amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest method and are included within the "
Interest expense" 
line of our consolidated statements of income. The Company incurred $
9.9
 million of new debt issuances costs in 2022 in conjunction with the issuance of the 2027 Notes and 
no
 new debt issuance costs were incurred in 2024 or 2023.
  Deferred financing expense was $
2.2
 million, $
2.3
 million and $
2.0
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The balance of unamortized deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
5.3
 million and $
7.4
 million, respectively. 
Research and Innovation Expenses
Research and innovation expenditures are expensed in the period incurred, except certain software development costs that are capitalized between the point in time that technological feasibility of the software is established and when the product is available for general release to customers.  We did not have any capitalized software costs related to research and development in any period presented. Research and Innovation expenses are included within "
Research and portfolio development
" expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

Compensation Programs
We use a variety of compensation programs to attract, retain and motivate our employees, and to align employee compensation more closely with company performance.  These programs include, but are not limited to, short-term incentives tied to performance goals, cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances, and long-term incentives in the form of stock option awards, time-based restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards, performance-based RSU awards and cash awards, noting equity awards are granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of our Equity Plans (as defined in Note 13, "
Compensation Plans and Programs
").  Our long-term incentives, including equity awards, typically include annual equity and cash award grants with 
three
 to 
five year
 vesting periods; as a result, in any one year, we are typically accounting for at least 
three
 active cycles.
We account for compensation costs associated with share-based compensation based on the fair value of the instruments issued. The estimated value of stock options includes assumptions around expected life, stock volatility and dividends. For stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, the Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method as prescribed by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14. The simplified method was used because the Company does not believe it has sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for the expected term of its grants. In all periods, our policy has been to set the value of RSUs awards equal to the value of our underlying common stock on the date of measurement.  For grants with graded vesting, we amortize the associated unrecognized compensation cost using an accelerated method. For grants that cliff vest, we amortize the associated unrecognized compensation cost on a straight-line basis over their vesting term. For awards containing performance conditions, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that the stated performance targets will be achieved and record cumulative adjustments in the period in which estimates change.  
In the event of canceled awards, we adjust compensation expense recognized to date as they occur.  Tax windfalls and shortfalls related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation are included in our tax provision.  On the consolidated statements of cash flows, tax windfalls and shortfalls related to employee share-based compensation awards are included within operating activities and cash paid to tax authorities for shares withheld are included within financing activities.  The inclusion of windfalls and shortfalls in the tax provision could increase our earnings volatility between periods.
 Tax windfalls and shortfalls related to share-based compensation was windfalls of $
4.9
 million and $
3.1
 million for the years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively, and shortfalls for the year ended 2022 of $
0.4
 million, respectively.
Restructuring
Restructuring activities include, but are not limited to, costs associated with termination benefits such as severance costs and retention bonuses, contract termination costs, and other costs associated with an exit or disposal activity. The termination benefits included within restructuring activities are recognized in accordance with either ASC 420, 
Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations
 ("ASC 420") or ASC 712, 
Compensation – Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits
 ("ASC 712"), as applicable. Liabilities are recognized in accordance with ASC 420 when management commits to a plan of termination, the employees to be terminated are identified, the terms of the benefit arrangement are established, it was determined that either changes to the plan or withdrawal are unlikely, and the arrangements were communicated to employees. Liabilities that fall under ASC 712 are recognized when the liability was determined to be probable of being paid and reasonably estimable.
Income Taxes
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the change was enacted.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. 
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We are subject to examinations by the U.S. IRS and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
65
Table of Contents
The financial statement recognition of the benefit for an uncertain tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority.  If this threshold is met, the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Treasury Stock
We record the repurchase of our shares of common stock at cost based on the settlement date of the transaction. These shares are classified as treasury stock, which is a reduction to shareholders’ equity. Treasury shares are included in authorized and issued shares, but excluded from outstanding shares. If the Treasury shares are retired, the excess of the par value is included with retained earnings.
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted in the United States, which included, among other items, a 
1
% excise tax on certain net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. This excise tax on our share repurchases is recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity, as treasury stock, or retained earnings if retired.

SEGMENT AND CONCENTRATION INFORMATION
Segment Performance Measures and Expenses
Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the Chief Executive Officer, assesses company-wide performance and allocates resources based on consolidated financial information. Consequently, we view the entire organization as 
one
 reportable segment and the strategic purpose of all operating activities is to support that one segment. The CODM evaluates company-wide performance based on multiple performance measures, including, but not limited to, net income. Our CODM does not generally evaluate our performance using asset or historical cash flow information.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Concentration of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable.  We primarily place our cash equivalents and short-term investments in highly rated financial instruments and in United States government instruments.
Our accounts receivable are derived principally from patent license and technology solutions agreements. Three licensees comprised 
84
% and 
75
% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our licensees, who generally include large, multinational, wireless telecommunications equipment manufacturers.  We believe that the book values of our financial instruments approximate their fair values.
Fair Value Measurements
We use various valuation techniques and assumptions when measuring the fair value of our assets and liabilities.  We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.  This guidance established a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of input used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). The levels of the hierarchy are described below:
70
Table of Contents
Level 1 Inputs — Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active markets.
Level 2 Inputs — Level 2 includes financial instruments for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the instrument such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets) or model-driven valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data, including market interest rate curves, referenced credit spreads and pre-payment rates.
Level 3 Inputs — Level 3 includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques including pricing models and discounted cash flow models in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including the company’s own assumptions. The pricing models incorporate transaction details such as contractual terms, maturity and, in certain instances, timing and amount of future cash flows, as well as assumptions related to liquidity and credit valuation adjustments of marketplace participants.
Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.  We use quoted market prices for similar assets to estimate the fair value of our Level 2 investments.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Our financial assets are included within short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets, unless otherwise indicated.  
Our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis are presented in the tables below as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements
Investments in Other Entities
As disclosed in Note 2, "
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Guidance
", we made an accounting policy election to utilize a measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, which applies to our long-term strategic investments in other entities.  Under the alternative, our long-term strategic investments in other entities that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.  Any adjustments to the carrying value of those investments are considered non-recurring fair value measurements.  
During years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net gains of $
2.0
 million and $
10.4
 million, respectively, and during year ended 2022 we recognized a net loss of $
1.3
 million resulting from observable price changes of our long-term strategic investments, which were included within “
Other income (expense), net
” in the consolidated statement of income. Certain of our investments in other entities may be seeking additional financing in the next twelve months or potential exit strategies.  We will continue to review and monitor our investments in other entities for any indications of an increase in fair value or impairment. 
Convida Wireless is a variable interest entity. We determined that we were the primary beneficiary for accounting purposes and consolidated Convida Wireless through September 30, 2023. As of October 1, 2023, we determined that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation, and accordingly, we deconsolidated Convida Wireless during fourth quarter 2023. Upon deconsolidation, we recorded our investment in Convida at fair value utilizing the income approach. Our investment in Convida Wireless is accounted for as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 "
Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures" 
and included within "
Other non-current assets, net
" in the consolidated balance sheet.
Patents
During 2024, we entered into patent license agreements in which a portion of the future consideration was in the form of patents. We estimated fair value of the patents subject to the agreements to be $
10.0
 million for determining the transaction price for revenue recognition purposes utilizing a combination of the market and cost approaches. The $
7.0
 million of the patents transferred during 2024 and the remaining $
3.0
 million patents will transfer in early 2025. The value will be amortized as a non-cash expense over the patents' estimated useful lives. 
72
Table of Contents
We estimated the fair value of the patents in these transactions using one of, or a combination of, an analysis of comparable market transactions (the market approach) and/or by quantifying the amount of money required to replace the future service capability of the assets (the cost approach). For the market approach, judgment was applied as to which market transactions were most comparable to the transaction. For the cost approach, we utilized the historical cost of assets of similar technologies to determine the estimated replacement cost, including research, development, testing and patent application fees.

The 
3.50
% Senior Convertible Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes") are convertible during the period January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025 and therefore are classified as "
Current portion of long-term debt
" as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 in our consolidated balance sheet.  The current conversion rate of the Notes is 12.9041 shares of our Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes. Upon the conversion of any 2027 Notes, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be converted, and will pay cash, shares of our Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Common Stock for any conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount being converted, if any, at the Company’s election, as set forth in the Indenture governing the 2027 Notes.
2027 Notes, and Related Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
On May 27, 2022 we issued $
460.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' transaction fees and offering expenses, were approximately $
450.0
 million. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 
3.50
% per year, payable in cash on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2022, and mature on June 1, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, converted or repurchased.
75
Table of Contents
The 2027 Notes will be convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted, pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, at an initial conversion rate of 12.9041 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
77.49
 per share). The conversion rate, and thus the conversion price, may be adjusted under certain circumstances, including in connection with conversions made following fundamental changes and under other circumstances as set forth in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes.
Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2027, the notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances: (1) on any date during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) beginning after September 30, 2022 if the closing sale price of the Common Stock was more than 
130
% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) if the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock any rights, options or warrants (other than in connection with a stockholder rights plan prior to separation of such rights from the shares of the Common Stock) entitling them to purchase, for a period of 
45
 calendar days or less from the issuance date for such distribution, shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average closing sale price for the 
ten
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution; (3) if the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock any cash or other assets, debt securities or rights to purchase the Company’s securities (other than pursuant to a rights plan), which distribution has a per share value exceeding 
10
% of the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution; (4) if the Company engages in certain corporate transactions as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes; (5) if the Company calls the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; (6) during a specified period if a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes) occurs; or (7) during the 
five
 consecutive business day period following any 
five
 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes for each day during such 
five
 trading day period was less than 
98
% of the closing sale price of the Common Stock multiplied by the applicable conversion rate on each such trading day. Commencing on March 1, 2027, the notes will be convertible in multiples of $
1,000
 principal amount, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes.
The Company may not redeem the notes prior to June 5, 2025. The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at the Company’s option, on or after June 5, 2025, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the trading day preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date.
If a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The 2027 Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company’s current and any future senior unsecured indebtedness, including its 
2.00
% senior convertible notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes” and together with the 2027 Notes, the "Convertible Notes"). The 2027 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the related collateral, and the 2027 Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of the Company’s subsidiaries.
On May 24 and May 25, 2022, in connection with the offering of the 2027 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (collectively, the “2027 Note Hedge Transactions”) that cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
5.9
 million shares of common stock, in the aggregate, at a strike price that initially corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2027 Notes, subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon any conversion of the 2027 Notes. The aggregate cost of the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions was $
80.5
 million.
Also on May 24 and May 25, 2022, we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions (collectively, the “2027 Warrant Transactions” and, together with the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions, the “2027 Call Spread Transactions”), whereby we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
5.9
 million shares of common stock at a weighted average strike price of $
106.22
 per share, subject to adjustment. As consideration for the 2027 Warrant Transactions, we received aggregate proceeds of $
43.7
 million. The net cost of the 2027 Call Spread Transactions was $
36.8
 million, which was funded out of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 Notes.
76
Table of Contents
Accounting Treatment of the 2027 Notes and Related Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
The 2027 Call Spread Transactions were classified as equity and the 2027 Notes were classified as long-term debt. The effective interest rate is approximately 
4.02
%.
In connection with the above-noted transactions, the Company incurred approximately $
9.9
 million of directly related costs, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and as a reduction of long-term debt. These costs are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.
2024 Senior Convertible Notes, and Related Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
On June 3, 2019 we issued $
400.0
 million in aggregate principal amount of 
2.00
% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes").  The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' transaction fees and offering expenses, were approximately $
391.6
 million. The 2024 Notes bore interest at a rate of 
2.00
% per year, payable in cash on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commenced on December 1, 2019, and matured on June 1, 2024, unless earlier converted or repurchased.
In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (collectively, the “2024 Note Hedge Transactions”) that cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
4.9
 million shares of common stock, in the aggregate, at a strike price that corresponded to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes, subject to adjustment, and were exercisable upon any conversion of the 2024 Notes.  The aggregate cost of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions was $
72.0
 million.
We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions (collectively, the “2024 Warrant Transactions” and, together with the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions, the “2024 Call Spread Transactions”), whereby we sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
4.9
 million shares of common stock at an initial strike price of $
109.43
 per share, subject to adjustment.  As consideration for the 2024 Warrant Transactions, we received aggregate proceeds of $
47.6
 million.  The net cost of the 2024 Call Spread Transactions was $
24.4
 million.
In 2022, the Company repurchased $
273.8
 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering of the 2027 Notes. We specifically negotiated the repurchase of the 2024 Notes with investors who concurrently purchased the 2027 Notes, such that their purchase of the 2027 Notes funded our repurchase of the 2024 Notes. 
 Additionally, in connection with the partial repurchase of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into partial unwind agreements that amended the terms of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions to reduce the number of options corresponding to the principal amount of the repurchased 2024 Notes. The unwind agreements also reduce the number of warrants exercisable under the 2024 Warrant Transactions. As a result of the partial unwind transactions, approximately 
3.3
 million shares of common stock in the aggregate that were covered under each of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions and the 2024 Warrant Transactions were unwound. Proceeds received from the unwind of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions were $
11.9
 million, and consideration paid for the unwind of the 2024 Warrant Transactions was $
3.8
 million, resulting in net proceeds received of $
8.0
 million for the combined unwind transactions.
Because the concurrent redemption of the 2024 Notes and a portion of issuance of the 2027 Notes were executed with the same investors, we evaluated the transaction as a debt restructuring, on a creditor by creditor basis. The accounting conclusion was based on whether the exchange was a contemporaneous exchange of cash between the same debtor and creditor in connection with the issuance of a new debt obligation and satisfaction of an existing debt obligation by the debtor and if it was determined to have substantially different terms. All creditors involved in the repurchase transaction also purchased 2027 Notes in approximately the same or greater amount as the 2024 Notes principal repurchased. Additionally, the repurchase of the 2024 Notes and issuance of the 2027 Notes were deemed to have substantially different terms on the basis that the fair value of the conversion feature increased by more than 10% of the carrying value of the 2024 Notes, and therefore, the repurchase of the 2024 Notes was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. We recognized a $
11.2
 million loss on extinguishment of debt during 2022 in connection with this repurchase, which is included within "
Other (expense) income, net
" in the consolidated statement of income. The loss on extinguishment represents the difference between the fair value of consideration paid to reacquire the 2024 Notes and the carrying amount of the debt, including any unamortized debt issuance costs attributable to the 2024 Notes redeemed. The remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of $
1.2
 million was amortized throughout the remaining life of the 2024 Notes.
On June 1, 2024, the 2024 Notes matured and we repaid the remaining $
126.2
 million in aggregate principal in cash and issued 
0.3
 million common shares to settle the remaining obligation. This issuance was effectively offset by our receipt of 
0.3
 million shares from the settlement of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions. Additionally, the 2024 Warrant Transactions settled, on a net-share basis during September through December 2024 resulting in the issuance of 
0.5
 million shares.

Madison Arrangement
In conjunction with the Technicolor Patent Acquisition, we assumed Technicolor’s rights and obligations under the Madison Arrangement, which commenced in 2015.  The Madison Arrangement falls under the scope of ASC 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements.
Under the Madison Arrangement, Technicolor and Sony combined portions of their respective digital TV (“DTV”) and computer display monitor (“CDM”) patent portfolios and created a combined licensing opportunity to DTV and CDM manufacturers.  Per an Agency and Management Services Agreement (“AMSA”) entered into upon the creation of the Madison Arrangement, Technicolor was initially appointed as sole licensing agent of the arrangement, and InterDigital has now assumed that role.  As licensing agent, we are responsible for making decisions regarding the prosecution and maintenance of the combined patent portfolio and the licensing and enforcement of the combined patent portfolio in the field of use of DTVs and CDMs on an exclusive basis during the term of the AMSA in exchange for an agent fee.
We were deemed to be the principal in this collaborative arrangement under ASC 808, and, as such, in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-36, 
Revenue From Contracts with Customers - Principal Agent Considerations
, we record revenues generated on sales to third parties and costs incurred on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of income.  Therefore, we recognize all royalties from customers as 
revenue
 and payments to Sony for its royalty share as operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income.  Cost reimbursements for expenses incurred resulting from fulfilling the duties of the licensing agent are recorded as contra expenses.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, gross revenues recorded related to the Madison Arrangement were $
209.5
 million, $
12.3
 million, and $
14.5
 million, respectively.  Net operating expenses related to the Madison Arrangement during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $
84.1
 million, $
6.2
 million and $
7.9
 million, including $
81.3
 million, $
3.3
 million, and $
5.3
 million related to revenue sharing, respectively, and are reflected primarily within "
Licensing
" expenses in the consolidated statement of income.
Long-term debt
An affiliate of CPPIB Credit Investments Inc. ("CPPIB Credit"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, is a third-party investor in the Madison Arrangement.  CPPIB Credit has made certain payments to Technicolor and Sony and has agreed to contribute cash to fund certain capital reserve obligations under the arrangement in exchange for a percentage of future revenues, specifically through September 11, 2030 in regard to the Technicolor patents. 
Upon our assumption of Technicolor’s rights and obligations under the Madison Arrangement, our relationship with CPPIB Credit met the criteria in ASC 470-10-25, 
Sales of Future Revenues or Various Other Measures of Income 
(“ASC 470”), which relates to cash received from an investor in exchange for a specified percentage or amount of revenue or other measure of income of a particular product line, business segment, trademark, patent, or contractual right for a defined period.  Under this guidance, we recognized the fair value of our contingent obligation to CPPIB Credit, as of the acquisition date, as long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet.  This initial fair value measurement was based on the perspective of a market participant and includes significant unobservable inputs which are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of the long-term debt as of December 31, 2024 is disclosed within Note 6, "
Concentration of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
.  Our repayment obligations are contingent upon future royalty revenues generated from the Madison Arrangement and there are no minimum or maximum payments under the arrangement.

Table of Contents
Under ASC 470, amounts recorded as debt shall be amortized under the interest method.  At each reporting period, we review the discounted expected future cash flows over the life of the obligation.  The Company made an accounting policy election to utilize the catch-up method when there is a change in the estimated future cash flows, whereby we will adjust the carrying amount of the debt to the present value of the revised estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate, with a corresponding adjustment recognized as interest expense within “
Interest expense
” in the consolidated statements of income.  The effective interest rate as of the acquisition date was approximately 
14.5
%.  This rate represents the discount rate that equates the estimated future cash flows with the fair value of the debt as of the acquisition date, and is used to compute the amount of interest to be recognized each period based on the estimated life of the future revenue streams.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a $
0.5
 million and $
1.6
 million net reduction of interest expense within “
Interest expense
” in the consolidated statements of income due to a change in estimate resulting from updated estimated cash outflows owed under the arrangement, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $
3.5
 million of interest expense related to this debt which is included within “
Interest expense
” in the consolidated statements of income.  Any future payments made to CPPIB Credit, or additional proceeds received from CPPIB Credit, will decrease or increase the long-term debt balance accordingly.
Restricted cash
Under the Madison Arrangement, the parties reserve cash in bank accounts to fund our activities to manage the portfolios.  These accounts are custodial accounts for which the funds are restricted for this purpose.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
24.2
 million and $
5.9
 million, respectively, of restricted cash included within the consolidated balance sheet attributable to the Madison Arrangement.  Refer to Note 5, "
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Marketable Securities",
 for a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash within the consolidated balance sheets.
Technicolor Contingent Consideration
As part of the Technicolor Acquisitions, we entered into a revenue-sharing arrangement with Technicolor that created a contingent consideration liability, which is 
accounted for under 
ASC 450 - Contingencies
 under the asset acquisition framework when the liability is deemed probable and estimable.
 Under the revenue-sharing arrangement, Technicolor receives 
42.5
% of future cash receipts from new licensing efforts from the Madison Arrangement only, subject to certain conditions and hurdles. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the contingent consideration liability from the revenue-sharing arrangement was deemed not probable and is therefore not reflected within the consolidated financial statements.

LITIGATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
ARBITRATIONS AND COURT PROCEEDINGS
Lenovo
In fourth quarter 2024, the Company reached an agreement with 
Lenovo
 Group Limited and certain of its subsidiaries (“Lenovo”) to enter into binding arbitration to determine the final 
terms
 of a new paten
t
 license agreement, which will be effective from January 1, 2024. On November 6, 2024, the Company filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce. As part of the agreement to arbitrate, both parties agreed to dismiss all pending litigations between them; the below proceedings have since been dismissed.
UK Proceedings
In August 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries filed a claim in the UK High Court against Lenovo. The claim, as amended, alleged infringement of 
five
 of the 
Company
’s 
patents
 relating to 
3G
 and/or 4G/LTE standards. The Company sought, among other relief, injunctive relief to prevent further infringement of the asserted patents or, in the alternative, a determination of the terms of a FRAND license.
Between 2021 and 2023, 
three
 of the Company’s European 
Patents
 were found 
by
 UK courts to be valid, essential and infringed by Lenovo. In March 2023, the UK High Court issued an order staying all deadlines with respect to the fourth and fifth technical trials.
On March 16, 2023, the UK High Court issued its order regarding judgment in the trial to determine how much Lenovo must pay for a license to the Company’s 
portfolio
 of cellular assets, awarding 
the
 Company a lump sum of $
138.7
 million for such license through December 31, 2023. On June 27, 2023, the court issued an order awarding the Company an additional $
46.2
 million, thus increasing the total award to $
184.9
 million, which was paid on July 11, 2023. The court also found that the Company should pay a portion of Lenovo’s costs and granted both parties permission to appeal on certain grounds. Both parties appealed certain aspects of the ruling, and in July 2024, the UK Court of Appeal ruled in favor of InterDigital and awarded the Company an additional 
amount
 of $
55.2
 million to a total of approximately $
240.1
 million. It rejected Lenovo’s appeal in its entirety and confirmed that Lenovo must pay for all of its past sales starting from 2007 through December 31, 2023. The court also found that Lenovo should pay the Company’s costs for the appeal and reduced the costs that Lenovo was awarded from the initial decision. Lenovo sought permission to appeal, and permission to appeal was refused by the UK Court of Appeals. Lenovo filed an application to the UK Supreme Court requesting permission to appeal in August 2024, which was withdrawn.
On September 24, 2023, Lenovo filed a new claim in the UK High Court, which alleged invalidity of 
two
 of the Company’s patents relating to 4G/LTE standards. Lenovo sought, among other relief, a declaration that the patents at issue were invalid, not essential, and not infringed, revocation of the patents at issue, and a declaration that, upon expiration of the current license in 2023, Lenovo is licensed under terms to be determined by the UK High Court through 2028 or, in the alternative, a determination of the terms of a FRAND license. In October 
2023
, Lenovo filed a request for an order that the Company indicate whether it is prepared to give an unconditional undertaking 
to
 enter into a global license on terms set by the UK Court, or failing that, a declaration that the Defendants are unwilling licensors; a hearing was held in December 2023 during which Lenovo agreed to stay its application. The Company filed a jurisdiction challenge in October 2023, and a hearing on such challenge took place in April 2024, following which, the jurisdiction challenge was denied. In November 2023, Lenovo filed an application seeking an expedited FRAND trial and an interim license until a FRAND decision is issued in the UK. A hearing on the interim license was held in February 2024; in March 2024 the UK High Court denied Lenovo’s request for the interim license. A FRAND trial was set for June-July 2025.

District of Delaware Patent Proceedings
In August 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware District Court") against Lenovo alleging that Lenovo infringes 
eight
 of the Company’s U.S. patents by making, using, offering for sale, and/or selling Lenovo wireless devices with 3G and/or 4G LTE capabilities. As relief, InterDigital sought: (a) a declaration that the Company is not in 
breach
 of its relevant FRAND commitments with respect to Lenovo; (b) to the extent Lenovo does not agree to negotiate a 
worldwide
 patent license, does not agree to enter into binding international arbitration to set the terms of a FRAND license, and does not agree to be bound by the terms to be set by the UK High Court in the separately filed UK proceedings described above, an injunction prohibiting Lenovo from continued infringement; (c) damages, including enhanced damages for willful infringement and supplemental damages; and (d) attorneys’ fees and costs.
In June 2023, the parties requested that the entire case be 
stayed
 pending resolution of all appeals in the UK proceedings, and this request was granted. 
District of Delaware Antitrust Proceedings
In April 2020, Lenovo and Motorola Mobility LLC filed a complaint in the Delaware District Court against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the Company defendants violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act in connection with, among other things, their licensing of 3G and 4G 
standards
 essential patents ("SEPs"). The complaint further alleged that the Company defendants have violated their commitment to the ETSI with respect to the licensing of 3G and 4G SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions. The complaint sought, among other things (i) rulings that the Company defendants have violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and are 
liable
 for breach of their ETSI FRAND commitments, (ii) a judgment that the plaintiffs are entitled to a license with respect to the Company’s 3G and 4G SEPs on FRAND terms and conditions, and (iii) injunctions against any demand for allegedly excessive royalties or enforcement of the Company defendants’ 3G and 4G U.S. SEPs against the plaintiffs or their customers via patent infringement proceedings.
In June 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Lenovo’s Sherman Act claims with prejudice, and to dismiss Lenovo’s breach of contract claim with leave to re-file as 
a

counterclaim
 in the Company’s legal proceeding against Lenovo in the Delaware District Court discussed above.
In March 2021, the Delaware District Court dismissed the Sherman Act Section 1 claim without prejudice, denied the motion to dismiss the Sherman Act Section 2 claim, and 
consolidated

the
 Section 2 and breach of contract claims with Company’s Delaware patent proceeding discussed above. 
International Trade Commission and Companion District Court Proceedings
In September 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries filed a complaint in the United States International Trade Commission (the "International Trade Commission") alleging that Lenovo infringes 
five
 of the Company’s U.S. patents by making, using, offering for sale, and/or selling 
certain
 electronic 
devices
, including smartphones, computers, tablet computers, and components thereof that infringe certain claims of the asserted patents. As relief, the Company sought: (a) a limited exclusion order against Lenovo barring from entry into the United States all of Lenovo’s products that infringe the asserted patents; (b) cease and desist orders prohibiting Lenovo from importing, selling, offering for sale, marketing, advertising, and distributing, infringing products; and (c) a bond during the 60-day Presidential review period. An evidentiary hearing was held in August 2024. 
Also in September 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (the "North Carolina District Court") alleging that Lenovo infringes those same 
five
 of the Company’s U.S. patents. As relief, the 
Company

sought
: (a) a finding that Lenovo is liable for infringement of the asserted patents; (b) an injunction against further infringement; (c) damages, including enhanced damages for willful infringement and supplemental damages; and (d) costs.
Germany Proceedings
In September 2023, the Company filed a complaint with the Munich Regional Court against Lenovo and certain of its affiliates, alleging infringement of a European patent 
relating
 to cellular 4G/LTE and/or 5G standards. The Company sought, among other relief, injunctive relief to prevent further infringement of the asserted patents. In May 2024, the Munich Regional Court issued a judgment finding Lenovo infringed the Company’s 
European
 patent and that the Company complied with its FRAND obligations while Lenovo did not; the Court ordered Lenovo to cease and desist selling infringing products. The Company served Lenovo with an enforcement note of the judgment in May 2024. Lenovo appealed the judgment and requested a stay of the enforcement of the judgment, and in June 2024, the Munich Regional Court rejected Lenovo’s request.

OTHER
We are party to certain other disputes and legal actions in 
the
 ordinary course of business, including arbitrations and legal proceedings with licensees regarding the terms of their agreements and the negotiation thereof. We do not currently believe that these matters, even if 
adversely
 adjudicated or settled, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. None of the preceding matters have met the requirements for accrual or disclosure of a potential range as of December 31, 2024, except as noted above.

COMPENSATION PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Compensation Programs
We use a variety of compensation programs to attract, retain and motivate our employees, and to more closely align employee compensation with company performance.  These programs include, but are not limited to, short-term incentive awards tied to performance goals, cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances, and long-term incentives in the form of stock option awards, time-based RSU awards, performance-based RSU awards and cash awards.
Our long-term incentives typically include annual time-based RSU grants or cash awards with a 
three-year
 vesting period, as well as annual performance-based RSU grants or cash awards with a 
three
 to 
five-year
 performance period; as a result, in any one year, we are typically accounting for at least 
three
 active cycles. Additionally, from time to time, executive officers are awarded long term incentives or new hire grants that may include time-based RSUs, performance-based RSUs or options. We issue new shares of our common stock to satisfy our obligations under the share-based components of these programs.  However, our Board of Directors has the right to authorize the issuance of treasury shares to satisfy such obligations in the future.
Equity Incentive Plans
On June 14, 2017, our shareholders adopted and approved the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2017 Plan"), under which officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants can receive share-based awards such as RSUs, restricted stock and stock options as well as other stock or cash awards. The plan was amended in order to reserve an additional 
1.8
 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2017 Plan.  Such amendment was adopted and approved by our shareholders on June 2, 2021.  Upon the adoption of the 2017 Plan, the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan was terminated and all shares remaining available for grant under the 2009 Plan were canceled and rolled into the 2017 Plan.  The number of shares available for issuance under the 2017 Plan, as amended, is equal to 
4.2
 million shares plus any shares subject to awards granted under the 2009 Plan that, on or after June 14, 2017, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, or that are forfeited to or repurchased by us.
83
Table of Contents
RSUs and Restricted Stock
We may issue RSUs to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants. Any cancellations of unvested RSUs granted under the Equity Plans will increase the number of shares remaining available for grant under the 2017 Plan.  Time-based RSUs vest over periods generally ranging from 
one
 to 
three years
 from the date of the grant.  Performance-based RSUs generally have a vesting period between 
two
 and 
five years
. Milestone performance-based RSUs may vest at any time, upon achievement of the milestone goal, during the performance period, which is typically 
five years
.
As of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based awards of $
37.2
 million, at current performance accrual rates.  For time-based grants with graded vesting, we expect to amortize the associated unrecognized compensation cost using an accelerated method.  For time-based grants that cliff vest, we expect to amortize the associated unrecognized compensation cost as of December 31, 2024, on a straight-line basis generally over the remaining vesting period. 
Vesting of performance-based RSU awards is subject to attainment of specific goals established by the Human Capital Committee of the Board of Directors.  Depending upon performance achievement against these goals, the number of shares that vest can be anywhere from 
0
 to 
3
 times the target number of shares.
Information with respect to current RSU activity is summarized as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Dividend equivalents accrue with respect to unvested RSUs when and as cash dividends are paid on the Company's common stock, and vest if and when the underlying RSUs vest.  Granted amounts include performance-based RSU awards at their maximum potential payout.
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted approximately 
0.5
 million,

0.7
 million RSUs under the Equity Plans, respectively, with weighted-average per share grant date fair values of $

Other Equity Grants
We grant equity awards to non-management Board members and may grant equity awards to certain consultants.
Stock Options 
The 2009 Plan allowed, and the 2017 Plan allows, for the granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options, as well as other securities.  The administrator of the Equity Plans, the Human Capital Committee of the Board of Directors, determines the number of options to be granted, subject to certain limitations set forth in the 2017 Plan.  We grant stock options to a limited number of the employee base annually as part of our long-term incentive programs, which have generally vested over 
three years
.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, performance-based options were granted for the first time.  The number of performance-based options which vest, if at all, is anywhere from 
0
 to 
3
 times the target number of options subject to the attainment of performance goals measured either during or at the end of the performance period. Performance-based options typically have a vesting period between 
two
 and 
five years
. Milestone performance options may vest at any time, upon achievement of the milestone goal, during the performance period, which is typically 
five years
.

Table of Contents
Under the terms of the Equity Plans, the exercise price per share of each option, other than in the event of options granted in connection with a merger or other acquisition, cannot be less than 
100
% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant.  Options granted under the Equity Plans are generally exercisable for a period of between 
seven
 to 
ten years
 from the date of grant and may vest on the grant date, another specified date, over a period of time and/or dependent upon the attainment of specified performance goals.  We also have less than 
0.1
 million options outstanding under a prior stock plan that do not expire.
The fair value for option awards is computed using the Black-Scholes pricing model, whose inputs and assumptions are determined as of the date of grant and which require considerable judgment.  Expected volatility was based upon a combination of implied and historic volatilities.  
The weighted-average grant date fair value per option award granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $

The weighted average remaining contractual life of our outstanding options was 
8.0
 years as of December 31, 2024. Options with an indefinite contractual life, which were granted between 1983 and 1986 under a prior stock plan, were assigned an original life in excess of 
50
 years for purposes of calculating the weighted average remaining contractual life. The majority of these options have an exercise price between $
9.00
 and $
11.63
.  
The total intrinsic value of our outstanding options as of December 31, 2024 was $
110.2
 million. Of the 
0.9
 million outstanding options as of December 31, 2024, 
0.4
 million were exercisable with a weighted-average exercise price of $
66.07
.  Options exercisable as of December 31, 2024, had total intrinsic value of $
54.7
 million and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 
7.6
 years.  The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
0.5
 million, $
5.4
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively.  In 2024, we recorded cash received from the exercise of options of $
0.1
 million.  Upon option exercise, we issued new shares of stock.
As of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized compensation cost on our unvested stock options of $
4.3
 million, at current performance accrual rates.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had approximately 
0.9
 million and 
0.7
 million options outstanding, respectively, that had exercise prices less than the fair market value of our stock at the respective balance sheet date.  These options would have generated cash proceeds to the Company of $
73.0
 million and $
46.7
 million, respectively, if they had been fully exercised on those dates.
Defined Contribution Plans
We have a 401(k) plan (“Savings Plan”) wherein employees can elect to defer compensation within federal limits.  We match a portion of employee contributions.  Our contribution expense to our Savings Plan and other defined contributions plans was approximately $
1.7
 million, $
1.4
 million and $
1.4
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Table of Contents
Under the Deferred Plan, eligible US employees may make tax-deferred contributions that cannot be made under the 401(k) Plan due to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 
50
% of a participant’s contributions up to 
6
% of the participant's applicable compensation.  From time to time InterDigital makes discretionary company contributions to the Deferred Plan on behalf of a participant.

(a) In 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a partial release of the valuation allowance it has in France due to income projected driven by recently signed agreements.
Valuation Allowances and Net Operating Losses
We establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that we will be unable to utilize the assets to offset future taxes. Given the binary nature of our business, at this time we believe it is more likely than not that the majority of our state net operating losses and net operating losses in certain subsidiaries in France, as well as our non-wholly owned subsidiaries in the United States and United Kingdom will not be utilized; therefore we have maintained a near full valuation allowance against our state, French and United Kingdom net operating losses as of December 31, 2024. We also maintain a valuation allowance against certain temporary differences other than the net operating losses in these jurisdictions.
At December 31, 2024, we had $
8.7
 million in U.S net operating loss carryforwards, which can be indefinitely carried forward, as well as non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards amounting to $
77.9
 million which can be indefinitely carried forward under French statutes. In addition, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $
1.4
 billion, of which $
36.8
 million can be indefinitely carried forward, while the remaining $
1.4
 billion will expire in varying amounts from 2025 to 2044.
The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when it expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. On December 31, 2024, the Company does not have distributable earnings in foreign subsidiaries that would be subject to deferred taxes. 
Uncertain Income Tax Positions 
As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had $
13.8
 million, $
14.4
 million and $
16.1
 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months for a number of reasons including audit settlements, tax examination activities and the recognition and measurement considerations under this guidance.
During 2024, we reduced the reserve previously established for the amended returns by $
0.7
 million for the benefit available in the current year had it not been included on the amended returns.
During 2023, we reduced the reserve previously established for the amended returns by $
0.7
 million for the benefit available in the current year had it not been included on the amended returns and reduced the reserve previously recorded for foreign withholding taxes by $
1.1
 million due to favorable guidance from the taxing authorities in the United States. 
87
Table of Contents
During 2022, we established reserves of $
1.1
 million related to uncertainty arising from our ability to credit foreign withholding taxes in jurisdictions without a tax treaty with the United States. We also reduced the reserve previously established for the amended returns by $
1.0
 million for the benefit available in the current year had it not been included on the amended returns.
The following is a roll forward of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits, which if reversed would impact the effective tax rate, for the fiscal years 2024 through 2022 (in thousands):

Our policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to United States federal income tax, foreign income and withholding taxes and income taxes from multiple state jurisdictions.  Our federal income tax returns for 2006 to the present, with the exception of 2011 and 2012, are currently open and will not close until the respective statutes of limitations have expired. The 2014, 2015 and 2018-2020 Federal income tax returns are currently under audit by the IRS. The statutes of limitations generally expire three years following the filing of the return or in some cases three years following the utilization or expiration of net operating loss carry forwards.  The statute of limitations applicable to our open federal returns will expire at the end of 2027.  The Company is subject to French corporate income tax on certain subsidiaries. The statute of limitations applicable to our open French returns will expire in 2026. Excluding the Korea Competent Authority Proceeding and the Finland Competent Authority Proceeding described in the section below, specific tax treaty procedures remain open for certain jurisdictions for 2014 to the present.  Many of our subsidiaries have filed state income tax returns on a separate company basis.  To the extent these subsidiaries have unexpired net operating losses, their related state income tax returns remain open.  These returns have been open for varying periods, some exceeding ten years. The total amount of state net operating losses is $
1.4
 billion.
Foreign Taxes
We pay foreign source withholding taxes on patent license royalties when applicable.  We apply foreign source withholding tax payments against our United States federal income tax obligations to the extent we have foreign source income to support these credits.  In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we paid $
23.3
 million, $
12.0
 million and $
5.5
 million in foreign source withholding taxes, respectively, and applied these payments as credits against our United States federal tax obligation. 
Between 2014 and 2024, we paid approximately $
141.9
 million in foreign taxes to foreign governments that have tax treaties with the U.S., for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our U.S. tax obligations, and for which the tax treaty procedures are still open.  It is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures, the U.S. government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits.  Due to foreign currency fluctuations, any such agreement could result in foreign currency gain or loss. 
On November 8, 2019, the Company received notification that its request for competent authority pertaining to Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the United States-Republic of Finland Income Tax Convention had been reviewed by the IRS and an agreement has been reached (the “Finland Competent Authority Proceeding”).  As a result of this agreement, the Company does not anticipate any tax consequences.

NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS") is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options or other securities with features that could result in the issuance of common stock were exercised or converted to common stock.

The following table reconciles the numerator and the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computation (in thousands, except for per share data):

Certain shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion of certain securities have been excluded from our computation of earnings per share because the strike price or conversion rate, as applicable, of such securities was greater than the average market price of our common stock for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, as applicable, and, as a result, the effect of such exercise or conversion would have been anti-dilutive.  
Set forth below are the securities and the weighted average number of shares of common stock underlying such securities that were excluded from our computation of earnings per share for the periods presented (in thousands):

Convertible Notes and Warrants
Refer to Note 10, "

," for information about the Company's convertible notes and warrants and related conversion and strike prices. During periods in which the average market price of the Company's common stock is above the applicable conversion price of the Company's convertible notes, or above the strike price of the Company's outstanding warrants, the impact of conversion or exercise, as applicable, would be dilutive and such dilutive effect is reflected in diluted EPS. As a result, in periods where the average market price of the Company's common stock is above the conversion price or strike price, as applicable, under the if-converted method, the Company calculates the number of shares issuable under the terms of the convertible notes and the warrants based on the average market price of the stock during the period, and includes that number in the total diluted shares outstanding for the period.

five
 $
100
 million increases to the program, respectively, and an additional $
333
 million in December 2022 and an additional $
235
 million in December 2023, bringing the total amount of the Share Repurchase Program to approximately $
1.4
 billion.  The Company may repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program through open market purchases, pre-arranged trading plans or privately negotiated purchases.

We currently expect to continue to pay dividends in accordance with our dividend policy; however, continued payment of cash dividends and changes in the Company's dividend policy will depend on the Company's earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.

LEASES
The Company enters into operating leases primarily for real estate to support research and development ("R&D") sites and general office space in North America, with additional locations in Europe, China, and Canada.  The Company does not currently have any finance leases.  Certain of our leases include options to extend the lease at our discretion at the end of the lease term, or terminate the lease early subject to certain conditions and penalties.  We do not include any renewal options in our lease terms for calculating our lease liabilities, as the renewal options allow us to maintain operational flexibility and we are not reasonably certain we will exercise these options.
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the specific facts and circumstances present.  Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term.  The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable, and, as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate based on information available on the lease commencement date.  Our incremental borrowing rate represents the rate we would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
The table below includes the balances of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 million loss on extinguishment of long-term debt recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.
The change in Other was primarily due to fair value adjustments of our investments and pension obligation resulting in $

 million and $
12.1
 million of net gains in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
2.4
 million of net losses in 2022. Additionally, the change is due to net losses on foreign currency translation arising primarily from euro translation of our foreign subsidiaries of $
7.9
 million and $
3.9
 million in 2024 and 2022, respectively, and a $
1.0

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
During 2021, we announced that, as a result of a strategic review of our research and innovation priorities, we commenced the process of a collective economic layoff in which we proposed a reduction in force of our research and innovation unit. We expanded our restructuring efforts to include general and administrative functions largely centered in the U.S. During 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize any restructuring expenses, and the Company considers the plan to be complete. We do not anticipate further restructuring charges and no there are no remaining restructuring liabilities.
As part of the Company’s evaluation of its flexible work policy and the impact of returning to the office, the Company evaluated its current office space footprint and its expected needs going forward. As the result of this evaluation, during 2022, we recognized a $

2.0
 million of right of use assets, related to the abandonment of portions of three of our leased properties, which was included within “

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the company; and
•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “
Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013).  Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that appears under Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
