We increased the quarterly cash dividend by $0.05 per share in both 2023 and 2024 to raise the dividend payable from $0.35 to $0.45 per share. In February 2025, we announced an additional increase in the quarterly cash dividend by $0.15 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in second quarter 2025. We currently expect to continue to pay dividends in accordance with our dividend policy; however, continued payment of cash dividends and changes in the Company's dividend policy will depend on the Company's earnings, financial condition, capital resources and capital requirements, alternative uses of capital, restrictions imposed by any existing debt, economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
OVERVIEW
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto contained in this Form 10-K. The following section generally discusses our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 compared to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for December 31, 2023 compared to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 15, 2024.
Throughout the following discussion and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we refer to “recurring revenues” and “catch-up revenues.”  For variable and dynamic fixed-fee license agreements, “catch-up revenues” primarily represents revenue associated with reporting periods prior to the execution of the license agreement, while “recurring revenue” represents revenue associated with reporting periods beginning with the execution of the license agreement. For static fixed-fee license agreements, we typically classify the associated revenue as catch-up revenues.

Business
InterDigital, Inc. ("InterDigital") is a global research and development company focused primarily on wireless, video, artificial intelligence ("AI"), and related technologies. We design and develop foundational technologies that enable connected, immersive experiences in a broad range of communications and entertainment products and services. We license our innovations worldwide to companies providing such products and services, including makers of wireless communications devices, consumer electronics, internet of things ("IoT") devices, cars and other motor vehicles and providers of cloud-based services such as video streaming. As a leader in wireless technology, our engineers have designed and developed a wide range of innovations that are used in wireless products and networks, from the earliest digital cellular systems to 5G and today's most advanced Wi-Fi technologies. We are also a leader in video processing and video encoding/decoding technology used in video-enabled products and services. Our AI research effort is focused on the intersection of AI with both wireless and video technologies.
InterDigital is one of the largest pure research and development and licensing companies in the world, with one of the most significant patent portfolios of fundamental wireless and video technologies. As of December 31, 2024, InterDigital's wholly owned subsidiaries held a portfolio of more than 33,000 patents and patent applications related to wireless communications, video coding, display technology, and other areas relevant to communications and entertainment products and services.  Our portfolio includes numerous patents and patent applications that we believe are or may be essential to existing standards, or may become essential to future standards, established by many Standards Development Organizations ("SDOs"). We have contributed technology to wireless standards including the 3G, 4G, and 5G cellular standards and the IEEE 802 suite of standards. We have contributed technology to video standards including standards established by ISO/IEC Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG), the ITU-T Video Coding Expert Group (VCEG), the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) and the Joint Video Expert Team (JVET), among others.
Our wireless portfolio has largely been built through internal investment in a world-class research team, supplemented by joint development projects with other companies, and select acquisitions of patents and companies. Our video technology portfolio combines patents and applications that InterDigital obtained through the acquisitions of the research and innovation unit and patent licensing business of visual technology industry leader Technicolor SA and patents and applications created by internal development. Our patented inventions have been implemented in a wide variety of products, including smartphones, tablets, base stations, televisions, laptops, gaming consoles, set-top boxes, streaming devices, connected automobiles, and other consumer electronics and IoT products. Our patented inventions have also been implemented in a wide variety of services, such as video streaming, user generated content sharing, video conferencing, video gaming, and other cloud-based services.     
Revenue

In 2024 and 2023, our total revenues were $868.5 million and $549.6 million, respectively.  Our recurring revenues were $408.4 million in both 2024 and 2023.  In 2024 and 2023, we recognized $460.1 million and $141.2 million, respectively, of catch-up revenues as more fully discussed below. In 2024, fixed-fee royalties accounted for 89% of our recurring revenues.  These fixed-fee revenues are not affected by the related licensees’ success in the market or the general economic climate.  The majority of the remaining portion of our recurring revenue was variable in nature due to the per-unit structure of the related license agreements.  
The Company considers Smartphone and CE, Auto/IoT as the groupings that best reflect the Company's core licensing programs. The Smartphone revenue grouping consists primarily of smartphones and also includes other wireless communication devices and infrastructure equipment, such as tablets, and base stations. The CE, IoT/Auto revenue grouping consists of consumer electronics and IoT products, such as televisions, laptops, gaming consoles, set-top boxes, streaming devices, and connected automobiles.
New Agreements 
During 2024, we entered into fourteen patent license agreements as discussed below. 
Direct Licenses
In January 2024, we signed a patent license agreement with Samsung Electronics (the "Samsung TV agreement"). The agreement licenses Samsung’s digital TVs and computer display monitors under InterDigital's joint licensing program with Sony and includes licenses to key technologies including ATSC 3.0, as well as licenses under InterDigital’s patents including HEVC, VVC and Wi-Fi.
In June 2024, we signed a new device license agreement with Google. The agreement licenses a range of devices including Pixel smartphones, Fitbit wearables, and other consumer electronics devices to InterDigital’s cellular wireless, Wi-Fi, and HEVC video patented technologies.

Table of Contents
In October 2024, we entered into a patent license agreement with OPPO. The agreement covers OPPO, realme and OnePlus branded mobile devices worldwide. As part of the agreement, both parties agreed to dismiss all pending litigations between us. 
In October 2024, we entered into an arbitration agreement with Lenovo to determine the terms of a new patent license. As part of the agreement to arbitrate, both parties agreed to dismiss all pending litigations between us. 
Additionally, we entered into licenses covering our technologies with Arcelik, Blu, Ericsson, Kyocera, Panasonic, Teltronic, TPV, and ZTE.
Expiration of License Agreements
Our patent license agreements with five licensees that expired between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024 have not yet been renewed. These patent license agreements contributed $17.2 million of recurring revenues in 2024. 
Seven of our revenue generating patent license agreements are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, including the Samsung TV agreement and the agreement with Xiaomi. Collectively, these expiring agreements not yet renewed accounted for $91.8 million, or approximately 22%, of recurring revenues in 2024.
We are actively working to renew these agreements on terms consistent with the licensees' respective market positions and utilization of our technology.
Notes, Hedge, and Warrant Transactions
Refer to Note 10, "
Obligations
" within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for definitions of capitalized terms used below.
2024 Notes and Related Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
On June 1, 2024, the 2024 Notes matured and we repaid $126.2 million in aggregate principal in cash and issued 0.3 million common shares to settle the remaining obligation. This issuance was effectively offset by our receipt of 0.3 million shares from the settlement of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions. Additionally, the 2024 Warrant Transactions settled, on a net-share basis during September through December 2024 resulting in the issuance of 0.5 million shares.
2027 Notes and Related Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
During 2024, the 2027 Notes had a dilutive impact of 2.2 million shares, which are offset from an economic standpoint by the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions and would result in no incremental shares being issued upon conversion. However, under GAAP, we are required to exclude the impact of the shares received from the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions counterparties from the calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
As of December 31, 2024, 5.9 million warrants remain outstanding related to the 2027 Warrant Transactions at a weighted average strike price of $106.22 per share, subject to adjustment, which mature on a net-share basis beginning September 2027 through April 2028. Assuming a share price of $175, we would issue 2.3 million of common shares related to the 2027 Warrant Transactions. Refer to "Financial Position, Liquidity, and Capital Resources — Convertible Notes" for further information regarding how changes in our stock price would affect the number of shares issuable related to the 2027 Warrant Transactions.
Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement
If we believe a party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture, use and/or sell certain products or services and such party refuses to do so, we typically offer such party to have royalties, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators).  If the party refuses that offer and we believe they are unwilling to agree to a patent license on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis, we may have no other viable recourse but to institute legal action against them to enforce our patent rights.  This legal action has typically taken the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding.  In addition, we and our licensees, in the normal course of business, might seek to resolve disagreements as to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation. Such legal actions ultimately may be decided by the presiding court, third party adjudicator, or a negotiated resolution between the parties.
31
Table of Contents
We initiated litigation against Lenovo and OPPO to enforce our intellectual patent rights in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Through these patent infringement actions, we successfully negotiated resolutions that resulted in patent license agreements being reached with OPPO in 2024 and Lenovo, with respect to our HEVC patents only, in 2023. Additionally, in 2024 we entered into an arbitration agreement with Lenovo to determine the terms of a new patent license for our cellular and other technologies. As part of these agreements, we and both third parties agreed to dismiss all pending litigations between us, and accordingly all litigations with Lenovo and OPPO have been dismissed as of fourth quarter 2024. Currently, our open enforcement actions include the arbitration proceedings with Lenovo and Samsung. The Samsung proceeding resulted from the arbitration agreement reached with Samsung Electronics, in which we agreed to binding arbitration to establish the royalties to be paid by Samsung for a worldwide license to certain of our patents. We expect a decision in early 2025. The Lenovo arbitration is in its early stages, and no schedule has been set yet.
These matters are more fully discussed in Note 12, “
Litigation and Legal Proceedings
,” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included below in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  
In 2024, our intellectual property enforcement costs increased to $56.2 million, from $48.8 million in 2023. These costs represented 33% of our total licensing costs of $169.2 million in 2024.  Intellectual property enforcement costs will vary depending upon activity levels, and it is likely they will continue to be a significant expense for us in the future.
Cash and Short-Term Investments
As of December 31, 2024, we had $982.4 million of cash, restricted cash, and short-term investments and an additional $1.4 billion of cash payments due under contracted fixed price agreements, which includes our conservative estimates of the minimum cash receipts that we expect to receive under the Samsung and Lenovo arbitrations.
89% of our recurring revenue comes from fixed-fee royalties. Such agreements often have prescribed payment schedules that are uneven and sometimes front-loaded, resulting in timing differences between when we collect the cash payments and recognize the related revenue.
The following table reconciles the timing differences between cash receipts and recognized revenue on a quarterly basis for each of the last two years, including the resulting operating cash flow (in thousands):

When we collect payments on a front-loaded basis, we recognize a deferred revenue liability equal to the cash received and accounts receivable recorded which relate to revenue expected to be recognized in future periods. That liability is then reduced as we recognize revenue over the balance of the agreement.

Return of Capital
In June 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Subsequently our Board of Directors authorized five $100 million increases to the program, an additional $333 million in December 2022, and an additional $235 million in December 2023, bringing the total amount of the Share Repurchase Program to nearly $1.4 billion. Since 2014, we have repurchased $1.1 billion of shares at an average price of $63.27, adjusted for dividends.  This amount includes the $199.9 million, excluding fees, expenses and excise tax, repurchased as part of the modified “Dutch auction” tender offer in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, there was $229.5 million remaining under the Share Repurchase Program authorization.
Since January 2014, we have paid $437.5 million in dividends, bringing our total return of capital over this period to nearly $1.6 billion.
The table below sets forth the total number of shares repurchased and the dollar value of shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program, cash dividends on outstanding common stock declared, and the total capital returned to our shareholders (in thousands):

Impact of Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Factors
We have been actively monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic environment in the U.S. and globally characterized by inflation, supply chain issues, high interest rates, labor shortages, and the potential for a recession. These market factors, as well as the impacts of the Ukraine-Russia and Middle East conflicts, have not had a material impact on our business to date. However, if these conditions continue or worsen, they could have an adverse effect on our operating results and our financial condition.
33
Table of Contents
Comparability of Financial Results
When comparing our 2024 financial results against the financial results of other periods, the following items should be taken into consideration:
Revenue
•
Our 2024 revenue includes $460.1 million of catch-up revenues primarily resulting from the Samsung TV and OPPO agreements entered into in 2024, as well as revenue recognized on the Lenovo cellular license resulting from the UK proceedings and arbitration agreement.
Operating Expenses
•
In 2024, we incurred $68.8 million of nonrecurring revenue share costs associated with the catch-up revenues recognized in the period.
•
In 2024, we recorded $4.4 million of one-time contra expenses for a net litigation fee reimbursement resulting from intellectual property enforcement successes.
•
In 2024, we incurred $1.0 million of nonrecurring share-based compensation costs driven by licensing successes.
Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net
•
In 2024, we recognized $2.0 million of net gains resulting from observable price changes of our long-term strategic investments, which was included within “
Other income (expense), net
” in the consolidated statement of income.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.  Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.  Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.  Actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements.  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, "
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Guidance
" within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  We believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others are those relating to revenue recognition, compensation, and income taxes.  If different assumptions were made or different conditions existed, our financial results could have been materially different.
    Revenue Recognition
We derive the vast majority of our revenue from patent licensing. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depend upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations.  Such agreements are often complex and include multiple performance obligations. These agreements can include, without limitation, performance obligations related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities, patent and/or know-how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees, access to a portfolio of technology as it exists at a point in time, and access to a portfolio of technology at a point in time along with promises to provide any technology updates to the portfolio during the term. 
In accordance with GAAP, we use a five-step model to achieve the core underlying principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. These steps include (1) identifying the contract with the customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligation(s). Additionally, we have elected to utilize certain practical expedients in the application of ASC 606. In evaluating the presence of a significant financing component in our agreements, we utilize the practical expedient to exclude any contracts wherein the gap between payment by our customers and the delivery of our performance obligation is less than one year.  We have also elected to utilize the practical expedient related to costs of obtaining a contract where an entity may recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Timing of revenue recognition may differ significantly from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets are included in accounts receivable and represent unbilled amounts expected to be received from customers in future periods, where the revenue recognized to date exceeds the amount billed, and right to payment is subject to the underlying contractual terms. Contract assets are classified as long-term assets if the payments are expected to be received more than one year from the reporting date. Contract assets due within less than twelve months of the balance sheet date are included within accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Contract assets due more than twelve months after the balance sheet date are included within other non-current assets.

For certain patent license agreements or other contractual arrangements, the amount of consideration that we will receive is uncertain.  In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance. Such estimates are only recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts we expect we are most likely to receive. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.   
     Patent License Agreements
Upon signing a patent license agreement, we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications. We account for patent license agreements in accordance with the guidance indicated above. 
Certain patent license agreements contain revenue from non-financial sources in the form of patents received from the customer. Under our patent license agreements, we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products. 
Consideration for Past Patent Royalties
Consideration related to a licensee’s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement. We may also receive consideration for past patent royalties in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement. In each of these cases, we record the consideration as revenue as prescribed by the five-step model. 
Fixed-Fee Agreements
Fixed-fee license agreements include fixed, non-refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee’s obligations to us under a patent license agreement for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement for specified products, under certain patents or patent claims, for sales in certain countries, or a combination thereof - in each case for a specified time period (including for the life of the patents licensed under the agreement). 
Dynamic fixed-fee license agreements
 contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of technology over the license term, since our promise to transfer to the licensee access to the portfolio as it exists at inception of the license, along with promises to provide any technology updates to the portfolio during the term, are not separately identifiable. Upon entering a new agreement, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations delivered at signing (e.g. our existing patent portfolio) and future performance obligations (e.g. the technology updates). We use a time-based input method of progress to determine the timing of revenue recognition, and as such we recognize the future deliverables on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. We utilize the straight-line method as we believe that it best depicts efforts expended to develop and transfer updates to the customer evenly throughout the term of the agreement. 
Static fixed-fee license agreements
 are fixed-price contracts that generally do not include updates to technology we create after the inception of the license agreement or in which the customer does not stand to substantively benefit from those updates during the term. Although we have few static fixed-fee license agreements, we generally satisfy our performance obligations under such agreements at contract signing, and, as such, revenue is recognized at that time. 
Variable Agreements
Upon entering a new variable patent license agreement, the licensee typically agrees to pay royalties or license fees on licensed products sold during the term of the agreement. We utilize the sales- or usage- based royalty exception for these agreements and recognize revenues during the contract term when the underlying sale or usage occurs.  Our licensees under variable agreements provide us with quarterly royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us. We typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees’ underlying sales occurred. As a result, we are required to estimate revenues and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Estimating licensees’ quarterly royalties prior to receiving the royalty reports requires us to make assumptions and judgments related to forecasted trends and growth rates used to estimate our licensees’ sales, which could have an impact on the amount of revenue we report on a quarterly basis. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees’ sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.

Agreements with Multiple Performance Obligations
During 2024, we signed new fixed-fee agreements that had multiple performance obligations.  Consistent with the revenue recognition policies disclosed above, we (1) identified the contract with the customer, (2) identified the performance obligations, (3) determined the transaction price, (4) allocated the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognized revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations.  We allocated the transaction price to each performance obligation for accounting purposes using our best estimate of the term and value.  The process for determining the value of the standalone selling prices of identified performance obligations in dynamic fixed-fee license agreements requires the exercise of significant judgment when evaluating the valuation methods and assumptions, including the assumed royalties, projected sales volumes, discount rate, identification of comparable market transactions which are not directly observable and other relevant factors. Changes in any of a number of these assumptions could have had a substantial impact on the relative fair value assigned to each performance obligation for accounting purposes.  These inputs and assumptions represent management's best estimates at the time of the transaction. 
The impact that a five percent change in the aggregate amount allocated to catch-up revenues under these agreements would have had on 2024 revenue is summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Revenue from Non-financial Sources
During 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 2%, 3% and 4%, respectively, of our total revenue was based on the estimated fair value of non-financial consideration received, principally patents. The process for determining the value of revenue from non-financial sources requires estimating the fair value of patents received. We estimated the fair value of the patents in the above transactions using one of, or a combination of, an analysis of comparable market transactions (the market approach), a discounted cash flow analysis (the income approach) and/or by quantifying the amount of money required to replace the future service capability of the assets (the cost approach). For the market approach, judgment was applied as to which market transactions were most comparable to the transaction. For the income approach, the inputs and assumptions used to develop these estimates were based on a market participant perspective and included estimates of projected royalties, discount rates, economic lives and income tax rates, among others. For the cost approach, we utilized the historical cost of assets of similar technologies to determine the estimated replacement cost, including research, development, testing and patent application fees. The development of a number of these inputs and assumptions requires a significant amount of management judgment and is based upon a number of factors, including identification of comparable market transactions, assumed royalties, projected sales volumes, economic lives of the patents and other relevant factors. Changes in any of a number of these assumptions could have had a substantial impact on the fair value assigned to the patents for accounting purposes. These inputs and assumptions represent management's best estimates at the time of the transaction.  
The impact that a five-percent change in the estimated aggregate value of the patents acquired would have had on 2024 revenue, patent amortization and pre-tax income is summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Compensation Programs
We use a variety of compensation programs to attract, retain and motivate our employees, and to align employee compensation more closely with company performance.  These programs include, but are not limited to, short-term incentives tied to performance goals, cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances, and long-term incentives in the form of stock option awards, time-based restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards, performance-based RSU awards and cash awards, noting equity awards are granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of our Equity Plans (as defined within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).  Our long-term incentives, including equity awards, typically include annual equity or cash award grants with three to five year vesting periods; as a result, in any one year, we are typically accounting for at least three active cycles.  
36
Table of Contents
The aggregate amount of performance compensation expense we record in a period, under both short-term and long-term incentive compensation programs, requires the input of subjective assumptions and is a function of our estimated progress toward performance goals at both the beginning and the end of the period.  Our estimated progress toward goals under performance equity grants is based on meeting a minimum confidence level of achievement in accordance with accounting rules for share-based compensation. Due to the binary nature of patent license agreements, performance awards with milestone goals are typically not expensed until the goal has been achieved. Achievement rates can vary by performance cycle and from period to period, resulting in variability in our compensation expense.  
We account for compensation costs associated with share-based compensation based on the fair value of the instruments issued. The estimated value of stock options includes assumptions around expected life, stock volatility and dividends. For stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, the Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method as prescribed by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14. The simplified method was used because the Company does not believe it has sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis for the expected term of its grants. In all periods, our policy has been to set the value of RSUs awards equal to the value of our underlying common stock on the date of measurement.  For grants with graded vesting, we amortize the associated unrecognized compensation cost using an accelerated method. For grants that cliff vest, we amortize the associated unrecognized compensation cost on a straight-line basis over their vesting term. For awards containing performance conditions, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that the stated performance targets will be achieved and record cumulative adjustments in the period in which estimates change.  
In the event of canceled awards, we adjust compensation expense recognized to date as they occur.  Tax windfalls and shortfalls related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation are included in our tax provision.  On the consolidated statements of cash flows, tax windfalls and shortfalls related to employee share-based compensation awards are included within operating activities and cash paid to tax authorities for shares withheld are included within financing activities.  The inclusion of windfalls and shortfalls in the tax provision could increase our earnings volatility between periods. Tax windfalls and shortfalls related to share-based compensation was windfalls of $4.9 million and $3.1 million for the years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively, and shortfalls for the year ended 2022 of $0.4 million.

Income Taxes
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the change was enacted.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. 
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.  We are subject to examinations by the U.S. IRS and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
37
Table of Contents
The financial statement recognition of the benefit for an uncertain tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority.  If this threshold is met, the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  In the event that the IRS or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future, it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
Between 2014 and 2024, we paid approximately $141.9 million in foreign taxes to foreign governments that have tax treaties with the U.S., for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our U.S. tax obligations, and for which the tax treaty procedures are still open.  It is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures, the U.S. government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits.  Due to foreign currency fluctuations, any such agreement could result in foreign currency gain or loss. If the matter had been resolved as of December 31, 2024, we would have recognized a loss up to $22.8 million based on exchange rates and prior competent authority resolutions. 
On November 8, 2019, the Company received notification that its request for competent authority pertaining to Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the United States-Republic of Finland Income Tax Convention had been reviewed by the IRS and an agreement has been reached (the “Finland Competent Authority Proceeding”).  As a result of this agreement, the Company does not anticipate any tax consequences.

Legal Proceedings
We are routinely involved in disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property, including litigations, arbitrations and other proceedings.  These litigations, arbitrations and other proceedings are important means to enforce our intellectual property rights.  We are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property, but also arising in the ordinary course of our business.  Refer to Note 12, “
Litigation and Legal Proceedings
,” to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included below in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our material legal proceedings.
FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as well as cash generated from operations. We believe we have the ability to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity financings. From time to time, we may engage in a variety of transactions to augment our liquidity position as our business dictates and to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions, including the incurrence or issuance of debt and the refinancing or restructuring of existing debt. Based on our past performance and current expectations, we believe our available sources of funds, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from our operations, will be sufficient to finance our operations, capital requirements, debt obligations, existing stock repurchase program, dividend program, and other contractual obligations discussed below in both the short-term over the next twelve months, and the long-term beyond twelve months.
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had the following amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments (in thousands):

The net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments was attributable to cash used in financing activities of $272.4 million and cash used in investing activities of $47.2 million, excluding sales and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $271.5 million. Refer to the sections below                                                                                   for further discussion of these items.

Our cash flows provided by operating activities are principally derived from cash receipts from patent license agreements, offset by cash operating expenses and income tax payments. The $57.8 million change in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by higher cash receipts from new agreements and due to timing of cash receipts under existing agreements. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses primarily due to increased revenue share costs from new patent license agreements. The table below sets forth the significant items comprising our cash flows provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

(b) Income taxes paid include foreign withholding taxes.
Cash provided by or used in investing and financing activities
Net cash provided by investing activities in 2024 was $109.5 million, a $194.6 million change from $85.2 million net cash used in investing activities in 2023. During 2024, we sold $156.7 million of short-term marketable securities, net of purchases, and capitalized $63.0 million of patent costs, patent purchases, and property and equipment purchases. Additionally, we received $15.8 million of net cash receipts from the sales our long-term strategic investments. During 2023, we purchased $38.7 million of short-term marketable securities, net of sales, and capitalized $44.6 million of patent costs and property and equipment purchases.
Net cash used in financing activities for 2024 was $272.4 million, a $116.4 million change from net cash used in financing activities of $388.8 million in 2023. This change was primarily attributable to a $273.0 million decrease in share repurchases in 2024 compared to 2023, of which $203.4 million was related to the Company's modified "Dutch auction" tender offer in 2023. This change was partially offset by $141.4 million of payments on our long-term debt, of which $126.2 million was related to the maturity of the 2024 Notes.
Other
Our combined short-term and long-term deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2024 was $360.1 million, a decrease of $17.3 million from December 31, 2023.  Based on current license agreements, we expect the amortization of dynamic fixed-fee royalty payments to reduce the December 31, 2024 deferred revenue balance by $178.0 million over the next twelve months.

Convertible Notes
Refer to Note 10, "
Obligations
" within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for definitions of capitalized terms used below.
 The 2024 Notes matured on June 1, 2024 resulting in 0.3 million of common shares being issued. This issuance was effectively offset by the settlement of the 2024 Note Hedge Transactions resulting in zero net shares being issued on June 1, 2024. Additionally, the 2024 Warrant Transactions settled on a net-share basis during 2024 resulting in the issuance of 0.5 million shares related to the 2024 Warrant Transactions.
Our 2027 Notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, we must assume that conversion of convertible securities occurs at the beginning of the reporting period. The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be converted and any remaining obligation may be settled in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof. As the principal amount must be paid in cash and only the conversion spread is settled in shares, we only include the net number of incremental shares that would be issued upon conversion. We must calculate the number of shares of our common stock issuable under the terms of the 2027 Notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period.
At the time we issued the 2027 Notes, we entered into the 2027 Call Spread Transactions that together were designed to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued in the event of conversion of the 2027 Notes by, in effect, increasing the conversion price of the 2027 Notes from our economic standpoint. However, under GAAP, since the impact of the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions is anti-dilutive, we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement.
During periods in which the average market price of our common stock is above the applicable conversion price of the Convertible Notes ($77.49 per share for the 2027 Notes as of December 31, 2024) or above the weighted average strike price of the warrants ($106.22 per share for the 2027 Warrant Transactions s as of December 31, 2024), the impact of conversion or exercise, as applicable, would be dilutive and such dilutive effect is reflected in diluted earnings per share. As a result, in periods where the average market price of our common stock is above the conversion price or strike price, as applicable, under the if-converted method, we calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of the 2027 Notes and the warrants based on the average market price of the stock during the period, and include that number in the total diluted shares outstanding for the period.

Table of Contents
Under the if-converted method, changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation. As described in Note 10, "
Obligations
" within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the 2027 Notes are convertible into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be converted and any remaining obligation may be in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination thereof ("net share settlement"). Assuming net share settlement upon conversion, the following tables illustrate how, based on the $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2024, and the approximately 5.9 million warrants related to the 2027 Notes, outstanding as of the same date, changes in our stock price would affect (i) the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, (ii) the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants subject to the 2027 Warrant Transactions, (iii) the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the 2027 Notes, after applying the if-converted method, for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share ("Total If-Converted Method Incremental Shares"), (iv) the number of shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon settlement of the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions and (v) the number of shares issuable upon concurrent conversion of the 2027 Notes, exercise of the warrants subject to the 2027 Warrant Transactions, and settlement of the 2027 Note Hedge Transactions (in thousands):

(a)
The table above represents the payment made on the maturity date of the 2027 Notes. From the period January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025, the holders of the 2027 Notes have the right, but not the obligation, to convert any portion of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes. We will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be converted, if any, and will pay cash, shares of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Common Stock for any conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount being converted at our election. Refer to Note 10, “
Obligations
,” within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for details of our 2027 Notes.
(b)

The $101.0 million increase in operating expenses was driven by a $78.0 million increase in revenue share costs primarily related to the catch-up revenues recognized from the Samsung TV and TPV agreements. Additionally, intellectual property enforcement costs increased $19.3 million due to costs associated with the Lenovo and OPPO proceedings, as well as the Samsung arbitration, and performance-based compensation increased $17.6 million due to higher accrual rates driven by licensing successes. These increases were partially offset by a change in the nonrecurring net litigation reimbursement of $4.4 million contra-expense recorded in 2024 compared to $7.5 million of expense recorded in 2023.
Research and portfolio development expense:
  Research and portfolio development expense were relatively flat compared to 2023.

The change in Other was primarily due to fair value adjustments of our investments and pension obligation resulting in $5.4 million and $12.1 million of net gains in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and due to a foreign currency translation net loss arising primarily from euro translation of our foreign subsidiaries of $7.9 million in 2024, compared to $1.0 million foreign currency translation net gains in 2023.
Income Taxes
In 2024, based on the statutory federal tax rate net of discrete federal and state taxes, our effective tax rate is 16.5%, as compared to an effective tax of 10.0% in 2023.  The increase in the effective rate was primarily attributable the impact of a higher percentage of foreign derived intangible income and a larger reversal of a valuation allowance in the prior year.
