 Corporate Headquarters is an approximate 30-acre site, which includes the Columbia and SOREL brands' headquarters and centrally-managed departmental functions, including information technology, certain supply chain functions, finance, human resources and legal.
In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we sold our products in over 550 retail stores, including 28 temporary clearance locations. The vast majority of our retail stores are leased under a variety of arrangements, including long-term, short-term, and variable-payment leases. Our temporary clearance locations are leased on a short-term basis. We also have several leases globally for showrooms, office space, warehouse facilities, storage space, vehicles, and equipment, among other things. We believe that the Company's principal properties are in good condition and are suitable and adequate to support our business requirements. Refer to Note 8 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further lease-related disclosures.
