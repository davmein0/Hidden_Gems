ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements", Item 1, Item 1A, and Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, refer to Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for our discussion and analysis comparing financial condition and results of operations from 2023 to 2022. 
OVERVIEW
As a global leader in designing, developing, marketing, and distributing outdoor, active and lifestyle products, our mission is to connect active people with their passions. We provide our products through our four brands: Columbia, SOREL, Mountain Hardwear, and prAna; and two major product categories: apparel, accessories and equipment products and footwear products. Apparel, accessories and equipment products are provided by our Columbia, Mountain Hardwear and prAna brands. Footwear products are provided by our Columbia and SOREL brands. We sell our products in more than 110 countries and operate in four geographic segments: U.S., LAAP, EMEA, and Canada. 
ACCELERATE Growth Strategy
As part of our strategic priorities, in October 2024, we announced the Columbia brand ("Brand") ACCELERATE Growth Strategy. At its core, the ACCELERATE Growth Strategy is intended to elevate the Brand to target a younger and more active consumer. It is a multi-year initiative centered around several consumer-centric shifts to the Brand, product and marketplace strategies, as well as enhanced ways of working. We believe successful execution of the ACCELERATE Growth Strategy can elevate the Brand and drive profitable growth. Through the ACCELERATE Growth Strategy, we will focus on achieving the following objectives: 
•
steward existing consumer segments while focusing on bringing new younger and active consumers into the Brand;
•
elevate consumers' perception of the Brand;
•
create product based on a consumer-centric product construct;
•
enhance the positioning of the Brand in the U.S. marketplace; and
•
deliver integrated full-funnel marketing.
In addition, we are committed to investing in our strategic priorities with a renewed emphasis to:
•
accelerate profitable growth;
•
create iconic products that are differentiated, functional and innovative;
•
drive brand engagement through increased, focused demand creation investments;
•
enhance consumer experiences by investing in capabilities to delight and retain consumers;
•
amplify marketplace excellence, with digitally-led, omni-channel, global distribution; and
•
empower talent that is driven by our core values through a diverse and inclusive workplace.
Ultimately, we expect our investments to enable market share capture across our brand portfolio, expand gross margin, improve selling, general and administrative expense efficiency, and drive improved operating margin over the long-term.
Profit Improvement Program
Concurrent with the ACCELERATE Growth Strategy, we continue to make progress on our multi-year Profit Improvement Program to accelerate profitable growth and improve the efficiency of our operations. In 2024, we focused on four areas of cost reduction and realignment, including: 
•
operational cost savings;
•
organizational cost savings;
•
operating model improvements; and
•
indirect, or non-inventory, spending.

Table of Contents 
In 2024, our Profit Improvement Program delivered approximately $90 million in realized cost savings, net of approximately $3 million to $4 million of severance and other costs.  
While this program has meaningfully slowed SG&A spending growth, it has not been enough to align our cost structure with current sales levels. With this in mind, we are expanding the review of our cost structure as we pursue additional savings and enhance profitability. As we expand the program, our objectives include exceeding our previously stated goal of achieving $125 to $150 million in annualized savings by 2026 and positioning the Company to achieve SG&A expense leverage and operating margin expansion in future years.
Business Environment and Trends 
Heightened Geopolitical Risk |
 We sell our products in more than 110 countries and our ability to sell, import into and produce in certain markets may be impacted by ongoing geopolitical tensions. We believe these tensions will remain elevated, and will continue to manifest themselves in certain regions where we operate.
Changing U.S. Regulatory Environment |
 We are headquartered in the U.S. and are subject to the laws and regulations governing companies operating in the U.S. The recent U.S. presidential administration change may impact us in several respects, including in the areas of taxes and tariffs. With respect to tariffs, tariffs have long been built into apparel and footwear pricing and we attempt to minimize the impact felt by consumers through diversification of our source base and product engineering. To that end, we expect less than 3 percent of our finished products imported into the U.S. in 2025, by dollar value, will be manufactured in China. To the extent broad-based tariffs are imposed by the U.S. that impact a larger percentage of our source base, we may choose to raise prices to offset the increase in our cost of goods sold. Tariffs can also have an impact outside of expenses incurred by the Company or prices to consumers; they could impact the demand for our products as consumers weigh discretionary spending or even impact the availability of certain sourcing regions. Retaliatory measures may also increase and impact our ability to compete in other regions of the world.  
Increasing U.S. Competitive Environment and Evolving U.S. Consumer Trends | 
We believe our competition in the historical U.S. outdoor and active apparel and footwear market has increased as many brands have shifted their strategies and new parties have entered the marketplace to capitalize on the emergence of casual and lifestyle trends. The versatility of casual and lifestyle products provides consumers the ability to use these products in a variety of settings, including outdoor activities. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities, including the Columbia brand ACCELERATE Growth Strategy, will enable us to better compete in this evolved U.S. marketplace in the future.
Evolving North America Omni-channel Strategy 
|
 As part of the Columbia brand ACCELERATE Growth Strategy, we are approaching the North America marketplace with an omni-channel perspective and evaluating how, when, and where we utilize promotions across all channels to attract different consumer segments. We intend to retain our historical value-oriented consumers while attracting younger and more active consumers to the Columbia brand. 
During 2024, we shifted our marketing strategies for the Columbia brand's U.S. DTC e-commerce business to become less promotional, in order for Columbia.com to represent the best expression of the Brand. In our DTC brick-and-mortar business, we are opening a small number of branded stores in high-traffic shopping malls in North America. These new branded stores feature elevated product assortments that showcase Columbia’s apparel and footwear innovations. These stores will join the hundreds of Columbia branded stores that raise the image of the Brand in important international markets. Within our U.S. wholesale business, we implemented pricing, promotional and segmentation strategies which are also intended to elevate the positioning of the Brand in the marketplace.
While we expand the Columbia brand's target consumer, we intend to continue serving our core consumer base that is focused primarily on value. To capture demand associated with value-oriented consumers, we have increasingly relied on our fleet of DTC brick-and-mortar outlet stores. We believe general economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Canada is particularly impactful to these value-oriented consumers.
Normalizing Inventory Levels in the U.S. | 
In 2024 we operated numerous temporary clearance locations in the U.S. to move through excess inventory in a way that provided stronger financial returns to the Company in comparison to wholesale closeout sales channel alternatives and that had a less disruptive impact in the marketplace. As we exited 2024, our inventories were down 7% for the year and we plan to rapidly close our temporary clearance locations now that our inventories are in a healthier position.  We also believe wholesale partners are entering 2025 with cleaner inventory levels. We expect these changes in inventory in the market will support expansion of the Company's gross margin in 2025.
Changing International Consumer Trends |
 We believe consumers in many international markets have adjusted their shopping habits. In China, the outdoor apparel and footwear market has expanded, driven, in part, by governmental efforts to stimulate outdoor recreation. In Japan, the weakness of the Japanese Yen has contributed to an influx of international tourism which has benefited consumer demand, while 
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K  |  
23
Table of Contents 
domestic consumption has been soft due to inflationary pressures. Despite economic and geopolitical challenges in many other international markets, the outdoor apparel and footwear industry has been resilient and demand for our products has been healthy. We expect most of our international businesses to continue to grow in 2025, despite currency pressures.
Supply Chain Disruptions |
 Continuing Red Sea disruptions resulted in longer inbound transit times for Fall 2024 inventory. With pressure on key trade lanes, we expect inbound transit times to be elevated until the resolution of this conflict, which should result in reduced transit times and more favorable transit pricing. 
Seasonality |
 Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the industry, including seasonal weather and discretionary consumer shopping and spending patterns. Our products are marketed on a seasonal basis, and our sales are weighted substantially toward the third and fourth quarters, while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year.
 In 2024, 
over 60% of our net sales and over 90% of o
ur operating income were realized in the second half of the year. 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Non-GAAP Financial Measure

To supplement financial information reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), we disclose constant-currency net sales information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a framework to assess how the business performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar between comparable reporting periods. We calculate constant-currency net sales by translating net sales in foreign currencies for the current period into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates that were in effect during the comparable period of the prior year. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional and useful way of viewing an aspect of our operations that, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results, provides a more comprehensive understanding of our business and operations. In particular, investors may find the non-GAAP measure useful by reviewing our net sales results without the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management's internal comparisons to our historical net sales results and comparisons to competitors' net sales results. Constant-currency financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
The following discussion includes references to constant-currency net sales, and we provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP below.

 Constant-currency net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" above for further information.
Our global net sales decrease primarily reflected lower wholesale net sales in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by strength in international markets, as compared to 2023. The declines in wholesale net sales were driven by lower Spring and Fall 2024 orders, resulting from retailer cautiousness, including the transition of products to non-PFAS chemistry and a change in promotional practices, and a difficult competitive environment throughout the year, primarily in the U.S and Canada. Internationally, our net sales growth was broad-based across many markets within our LAAP and EMEA regions. We believe international net sales growth was attributable to the execution of our business strategies, as well as to the benefit of certain trends and/or factors favorably impacting the outdoor apparel and footwear sector.
DTC net sales increased, reflecting growth in our brick-and-mortar business from temporary clearance locations and new stores, partially offset by declines in our e-commerce business, compared to 2023. The declines in e-commerce net sales have resulted from softness in the U.S. and Canada throughout the year, which we attribute to a challenging environment and increased competition within the outdoor lifestyle category, and our decision to de-emphasize promotions on Columbia.com as part of the Brand's ACCELERATE Growth Strategy.

The decrease was driven primarily by decreased net sales and gross profit, partially offset by lower segment SG&A expenses and other segment items. U.S. net sales decreased $173.2 million, or 8%, in 2024, compared to 2023, driven primarily by decreased net sales in our U.S. wholesale business. The declines in wholesale net sales were driven by lower Spring and Fall 2024 orders, resulting from retailer cautiousness, including the transition of products to non-PFAS chemistry and a change in promotional practices, and a difficult competitive environment throughout the year. DTC net sales also decreased driven by lower e-commerce net sales, partially offset by net sales growth from our brick-and-mortar business. The declines in e-commerce net sales were attributable to a challenging e-commerce environment for outdoor brands, increased competition within the outdoor lifestyle category, and our decision to de-emphasize promotions on Columbia.com as part of the Brand's ACCELERATE Growth Strategy. The increases in brick-and-mortar net sales were primarily driven by temporary clearance locations and new stores for the year ended December 31, 2024. U.S. segment SG&A expenses and other segment items increased as a percentage of net sales to 31.9% in 2024 compared to 30.1% in 2023, primarily driven by fixed SG&A expenses and decreased net sales. In total, U.S. segment SG&A expenses and other segment items decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by lower supply chain expenses resulting from more normalized inventory levels and our Profit Improvement Program, including supply chain optimization efforts.

LAAP
LAAP segment operating income increased $15.2 million to $77.0 million, or 13.7% of net sales, in 2024 from $61.8 million, or 11.9% of net sales, in 2023. The increase was driven primarily by increased net sales and gross profit. LAAP net sales increased $41.0 million, or 8% (11% constant-currency), in 2024, compared to 2023. Increased LAAP net sales were primarily driven by our China, LAAP distributor, and, to a lesser extent, our Japan businesses, partially offset by declines in our Korea business. Increased net sales in our China business reflected continued strong consumer demand, aided by positive outdoor category trends. Increased net sales in our LAAP distributor business reflected growth in our Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 orders as compared to the same period in the prior year. Increased net sales in our Japan business were driven by strong demand from increased international tourism, which was largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation compared to the same period in the prior year. Decreased net sales in our Korea business reflected a continued challenging environment and increased competition within the outdoor lifestyle category. LAAP segment SG&A expenses and other segment items decreased as a percentage of net sales to 42.1% in 2024, compared to 44.4% in 2023, primarily driven by increased net sales. In total, LAAP segment SG&A expenses and other segment items increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.
EMEA
EMEA segment operating income increased $4.5 million to $103.5 million, or 20.2% of net sales, in 2024 from $98.9 million, or 21.1% of net sales, in 2023. The increase was driven primarily by increased net sales and gross profit. EMEA net sales increased $42.5 million, or 9% (8% constant-currency), in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily driven by our Europe-direct business. Increased net sales in our Europe-direct business were driven by robust demand within our DTC brick-and-mortar and e-commerce businesses for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our Europe-direct wholesale business realized a modest increase in net sales reflecting retailer cautiousness. Increased net sales in our EMEA distributor business reflected growth in our Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 orders as compared to the same period in 2023. EMEA segment SG&A expenses and other segment items increased in total and as a percentage of net sales to 28.1% in 2024 compared to 26.8% in 2023.
Canada 
Canada segment operating income decreased $7.8 million to $47.8 million, or 21.0% of net sales, in 2024 from $55.6 million, or 21.7% of net sales, in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales and gross profit. Canada net sales decreased $28.9 million, or 11% (10% constant-currency), in 2024, compared to 2023, driven primarily by decreased net sales in our Canada wholesale business. Decreased net sales in our wholesale business primarily reflected lower Spring and Fall 2024 orders, resulting from retailer cautiousness and a difficult competitive environment throughout the year. DTC net sales decreased, driven by lower net sales in our Canada e-commerce business, partially offset by an increase in our Canada brick-and-mortar business. Canada segment SG&A expenses and other segment items increased as a percentage of net sales to 29.1% in 2024 compared to 25.9% in 2023, primarily as a result of fixed expenses and decreased net sales. In total, Canada segment SG&A expenses and other segment items were flat for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.

Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and available committed credit lines. Our liquidity may be affected by the general seasonal trends common to the industry. Our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our sales are weighted substantially toward the third and fourth quarters, while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances generally are at their lowest level just prior to the start of the U.S. holiday season and increase during the fourth quarter from collection of wholesale business receivables and fourth quarter DTC sales. This trough cash position is impacted by the amount of product we order from our contract manufacturers in anticipation of customer demand and is more heavily impacted in advance of periods of expected high demand.

The change in cash flows provided by operating activities was driven by a $86.1 million decrease in cash provided by changes in assets and liabilities, as well as a $59.2 million decrease in cash provided by net income and non-cash adjustments. The most significant comparative changes in assets and liabilities included
 Inventories
,
 Accounts receivable 
and 
Accounts payable. 
The $244.7 million decrease in cash provided by 
Inventories 
was primarily driven by inventory liquidation efforts throughout 2023 and 2024. The $135.6 million decrease in cash provided by 
Accounts receivable 
reflected cash provided of $123.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a higher portion of fourth quarter wholesale sales collected in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, as well as cash used of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by a lower portion of fourth quarter wholesale sales collected in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. These amounts were partially offset by the $241.0 million decrease in cash used in 
Accounts payable,
 reflecting cash used of $85.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily resulting from the earlier production of and payment for Spring 2024 and Fall 2024 inventory, as well as cash provided of $155.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily resulting from the timing of inventory receipts and related payments, including a reduction in the use of early payments and extension of payment terms with certain vendors.   
Net cash provided by investing activities was $87.3 million for 2024, compared to $461.8 million of cash used in investing activities for 2023. For 2024, net cash provided by investing activities consisted of $816.2 million in cash provided by sales and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by $669.1 million in cash used for purchases of short-term investments and $59.8 million for capital expenditures. For 2023, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $528.5 million in cash used for purchases of short-term investments and $54.6 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by $121.3 million in cash provided by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
Net cash used in financing activities was $386.2 million for 2024 compared to $254.8 million for 2023. For 2024, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $317.8 million and dividend payments to our shareholders of $69.7 million. For 2023, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock of $184.0 million and dividend payments to our shareholders of $73.4 million.
Sources of Liquidity 
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $531.9 million and short-term investments of $283.6 million, compared to $350.3 million and $414.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.
Domestic Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2024, we had available an unsecured, committed revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to $500.0 million. We were in compliance with all associated covenants and there was no balance outstanding under the facility. Refer to Note 6 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our domestic credit facility.
International Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2024, our European subsidiary had available an unsecured, committed line of credit, which is guaranteed by the Company and provides for borrowings up to €4.4 million (approximately US$4.6 million). There was no balance outstanding under the facility.

Other Sources
As of December 31, 2024, collectively, our international subsidiaries had unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit, credit facilities and overdraft facilities, providing for borrowings up to approximately US$101.8 million. There were no balances outstanding under these facilities.
Capital Requirements
Our expected short-term and long-term cash needs are primarily for working capital and capital expenditures. We expect to meet these short-term and long-term cash needs primarily with cash flows from operations and, if needed, borrowings from our existing credit facilities. 
Our working capital management goals include maintaining an optimal level of inventory necessary to deliver goods on time to our customers and to satisfy end consumer demand, alleviating manufacturing capacity constraints, and driving efficiencies to minimize the cycle time from the purchase of inventory from our suppliers to the collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers. Inventory balances may be elevated in advance of periods of expected high demand. As of December 31, 2024, our inventory balance decreased to $690.5 million, compared to $746.3 million as of December 31, 2023, driven by a reduction in current season and carryover inventory resulting from lower inventory buys, as well as the use of our outlet stores and temporary clearance locations to profitably sell excess merchandise. We believe older season inventories represent a manageable portion of our total inventory mix.
We have planned 2025 capital expenditures of approximately $60 to $80 million. This includes investments in our DTC operations, including new stores and supply chain and digital capabilities to support our strategic priorities. Our actual capital expenditures may differ from the planned amounts depending on factors such as the timing of system implementations and new store openings and related construction.
Our long-term goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Dependent upon our financial position, market conditions and our strategic priorities, our capital allocation approach includes:
•
investing in organic growth opportunities to drive long-term profitable growth;
•
returning at least 40% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and
•
considering opportunistic mergers and acquisitions.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is calculated by reducing net cash flow from operating activities by capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since it excludes certain mandatory expenditures. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, cost of sales, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 2 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K  |

Table of Contents 
We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential effect on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from the estimates we use in applying these critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances. Our critical accounting policies and estimates relate to sales reserves, excess, close-out and slow-moving inventory, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, and income taxes.
Management regularly discusses with our Audit Committee each of our critical accounting estimates, the development and selection of these accounting estimates, and the disclosure about each estimate in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates, the trends in and amounts of these estimates, specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates, and any other relevant matters related to these estimates, including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation.
Sales Reserves
The amount of consideration we receive and recognize as 
Net sales 
across both wholesale and DTC channels varies with changes in sales returns and other accommodations and incentives we offer to our customers. When we give our customers the right to return products or provide other accommodations such as chargebacks and markdowns, we estimate the expected sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers and record sales reserves to reduce 
Net sales. 
As of December 31, 2024, our sales-related reserves were

$96.9 million compared to $103.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The most significant variable affecting these reserve balances is sales levels. As a percentage of 
Net sales
, the sales reserves balances were 2.9% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 3.0% as of December 31, 2023. The reserve for returns from customers or consumers is the component of our sales-related reserves most susceptible to estimation uncertainty. These estimates are based on 1) historical rates of product returns and claims; and 2) events and circumstances that indicate changes to such historical rates are warranted, such as our customers' inventory positions and their anticipated sell-through rates. However, actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. As a result, we adjust our estimates of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the amount of consideration becomes fixed. If actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly different than the sales reserves established, we record an adjustment to 
Net sales 
in the period in which such determination was made. 
Excess, Close-Out and Slow-Moving Inventory
We make ongoing estimates of potential excess, close-out or slow-moving inventory. We evaluate our inventory on hand to identify excess, close-out or slow-moving inventory by contemplating our purchasing plans, sales forecasts, historical liquidation experience, and the level and composition of inventory from current and prior seasons that remains unsold and establish provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Provisions are established when necessary in the period in which we make such a determination. As of December 31, 2024, our inventory provisions reduced gross inventory by $20.4 million compared to $23.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The level of estimated excess inventory as of December 31, 2024 decreased, reflecting the use of our outlet stores and temporary clearance locations to profitably sell excess merchandise.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, and capitalized implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements are evaluated for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our retail store fleet long‐lived assets are generally evaluated at the retail location level. Events that result in an impairment review of a retail location include plans to close a retail location or a significant decrease in the operating results of the retail location. When such an indicator occurs, we evaluate the retail location long‐lived asset or asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the location to the location long‐lived asset group’s carrying amount. If the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an analysis is performed to estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group. An impairment is recorded if the fair value of the asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount. 
During 2024, we tested certain long-lived assets consisting of property, plant, and equipment and lease ROU assets for impairment at certain underperforming retail locations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, impairment charges from underperforming retail stores were not material. Further declines in projected future performance may adversely affect the recovery of retail location assets.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K  |  
32
Table of Contents 
We review and test our intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Our intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trademarks and trade names (collectively, "trademarks"). Substantially all of our goodwill is recorded in the U.S. segment and impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are cash flow projections and the discount rate. Cash flow projections are developed in part from our annual planning process. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted-average costs of capital of the reporting unit from a market-participant perspective. When we include market-based valuation methods to estimate fair value of our reporting units as part of the goodwill impairment testing, we utilize market multiples for guideline public companies. 
In the impairment tests for trademarks, we compare the estimated fair value of each asset to its carrying amount. The fair values of trademarks are estimated using a relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying amount of a trademark exceeds its estimated fair value, we calculate impairment as the excess of carrying amount over the estimate of fair value. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets was $79.2 million, of which $51.8 million was attributed to prAna's trademark. In our 2024 impairment test, the fair value of prAna's trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 33% as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. As part of our evaluation, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the trademark impairment model. A 300 basis point decline in the compound annual growth rate for net sales assumed over the first eight years would reduce the excess of fair value over the carrying amount to approximately 12%. Separately, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would reduce the excess of the fair value over the carrying value to approximately 22%. A separate 50 basis point decline in the assumed royalty rate would reduce the excess of fair value over the carrying amount to approximately 21%. In our 2023 impairment test, we determined that the prAna brand's trademark was not impaired. In our 2022 impairment test, we determined that the prAna brand's trademark was impaired and we recognized a $18.7 million impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In the impairment test for goodwill, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of that reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we calculate an impairment as the excess of carrying amount over the estimate of fair value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methods, as appropriate. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill was $26.7 million, of which $12.3 million was attributed to the prAna reporting unit. In our 2024 impairment test, the fair value of the prAna reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 23% as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. As part of our evaluation, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the goodwill impairment model. A 300 basis point decline in the compound annual growth rate for net sales assumed over the first eight years would reduce the excess of fair value over the carrying amount to approximately 8%. Separately, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would reduce the excess of the fair value over the carrying value to approximately 15%. In our 2023 and 2022 impairment tests, we determined that prAna goodwill was impaired and we recognized a $25.0 million and $16.9 million impairment charge for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Our impairment tests and related fair value estimates are based on a number of factors, including assumptions and estimates for projected net sales, income, cash flows, discount rates, market-based multiples, and other operating performance measures. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. These assumptions and estimates may change in the future due to changes in economic conditions, changes in our ability to meet sales and profitability objectives or changes in our business operations or strategic direction.
Income Taxes
We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our uncertain tax positions. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for 
Income tax expense
 in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets to be inaccurate. Changes in any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Our assumptions, judgement and estimates relative to uncertain tax positions take into account whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position and the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. Changes in tax law or our

interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for 
Income tax expense 
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. As the calendar year progresses, we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction. This ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that our year-to-date provision equals our expected annual effective tax rate.

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to a variety of risks, including risks associated with global financial and capital markets, primarily currency exchange rate risk and, to a lesser extent, interest rate risk. We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices designed to mitigate their effects. We do not engage in speculative trading in any financial or capital market. 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
Our primary currency exchange rate risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to changes in exchange rates. We focus on mitigating changes in functional currency equivalent cash flows resulting from anticipated U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases by subsidiaries that use European euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, or Korean won as their functional currency. We also mitigate changes in functional currency equivalent cash flows resulting from anticipated non-functional currency denominated sales for subsidiaries that use U.S. dollar and European euro as their functional currency. We manage this risk primarily by using currency forward contracts. Additionally, we hedge net balance sheet exposures related primarily to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities using foreign currency forward contracts in European euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Chinese renminbi, Korean won, British pound sterling, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, Swedish krona and Czech koruna. Non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, payables, deferred income taxes, and intercompany loans and dividends.
The net fair value of our derivative contracts wa
s favorable by $32.0 million as of December 31, 2024. A 10% unfavorable exchange rate change in the euro, franc, Canadian dollar, yen, renminbi, won, pound sterling, krone, zloty, krona and koruna against the U.S. dollar would have resulted in the net fair value declining by approximately $63.5 million as of December 31, 2024. Changes in fair value of derivative contracts resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Our negotiated credit facilities generally charge interest based on a benchmark rate such as the secured overnight financing rate. Fluctuations in short-term interest rates cause interest payments on drawn amounts to increase or decrease. As of December 31, 2024, no balance was outstanding under our credit facilities.
COMMODITY PRICE RISK
We are exposed to market risk for the pricing of the raw materials used to manufacture our products. These raw materials are purchased directly by our contract manufacturers.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Columbia Sportswear Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbia Sportswear Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes, and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Intangible Assets, Net – prAna Trademark– Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company has trademarks and trade names (“trademarks”) that are indefinite-lived intangible assets. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the 
Intangible assets, net
 was $79.2 million, of which $51.8 million was attributed to prAna’s trademark. The Company used the relief from royalty method to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to projected net sales and royalty rate.
Auditing management’s estimates and assumptions related to projected net sales and the royalty rate for prAna involved especially subjective judgement.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s estimates and assumptions related to projected net sales and royalty rate for the prAna trademark valuation included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over intangible assets, including those over the forecasts of future net sales and selection of the royalty rate.
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K  |  
36
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future net sales by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s net sales forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:
◦
Historical net sales.
◦
Forecasted information included in the Company's press release as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.
•
To evaluate the reasonableness of the royalty rate we:
◦
Developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the royalty rate selected by management.
◦
Tested the source information underlying the determination of the royalty rate selected by management and compared to royalty agreements of comparable companies.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Columbia Sportswear Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Columbia Sportswear Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Consolidated
 Financial Statements
NOTE 1 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
Columbia Sportswear Company connects active people with their passions through its four brands, Columbia, SOREL, Mountain Hardwear, and prAna, by designing, developing, marketing, and distributing its outdoor, active and lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment products to meet the diverse needs of its customers and consumers.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Columbia Sportswear Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintains a controlling financial interest (the "Company"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company's significant estimates relate to sales reserves, excess, close-out and slow-moving inventory, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, and income taxes.
NOTE 2 — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents
 are stated at fair value or at cost, which approximates fair value, and include short-term highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
Cash and cash equivalents
 consisted of cash, money market funds, United States ("U.S.") government treasury bills, and time deposits.

INVESTMENTS
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
Short-term investments
 consisted of U.S. government treasury bills, as well as money market funds and mutual fund shares held as part of the Company's deferred compensation plan expected to be distributed in the next twelve months. The U.S. government treasury bills are classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported, net of tax, in 
Other comprehensive income (loss)
. Investments held as part of the Company's deferred compensation plan are classified as trading securities and are recorded at fair value with any gains and losses included in 
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 ("SG&A expenses").
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, long-term investments included in 
Other non-current assets
 consisted of money market funds and mutual fund shares held to offset liabilities to participants in the Company's deferred compensation plan. These investments are classified as long-term because the related deferred compensation liabilities are not expected to be paid within the next twelve months. These investments are classified as trading securities and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported as 
SG&A expenses
.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses resulting from the inability of the Company's customers to make required payments. The allowance represents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer 
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K  |

Notes to 
Consolidated
 Financial Statements
creditworthiness, historical levels of credit losses, and future expectations. Write-offs of accounts receivable were $
2.5
 million and $
2.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023
, respectively.

INVENTORIES
Inventories 
consist primarily of finished goods and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using standard cost, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess, close-out or slow-moving items and makes provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The principal estimated useful lives are: land improvements, 
15
 years; buildings and building improvements, 
15
-
30
 years; furniture and fixtures, 
3
-
10
 years; and machinery, software and equipment, 
3
-
10
 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvement, which is most commonly 
7
 years, or the remaining term of the underlying lease.
Improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Internal and external costs directly related to the development of internal-use software during the application development stage, including costs incurred for third party contractors and employee compensation, are capitalized and depreciated over a 
3
-
10
 year estimated useful life.

CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTS
The Company’s cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts ("CCAs") primarily relate to various enterprise resource planning systems, as well as other supporting systems. Implementation costs associated with CCAs are capitalized ("CCA assets") when incurred during the application development stage and generally included in 
Other non-current assets
 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. CCA assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their assessed useful lives or the contractual term of the CCA contract, with amortization included in the same financial statement line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the expense for fees in the associated CCA contract.
 As of December 31, 2024, CCA assets in-service have useful lives which range from approximately 
one year
 to 
six years
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, CCA assets consisted of capitalized implementation costs of $
42.4
 million and $
38.6
 million, respectively and associated accumulated amortization of $
28.6
 million and $
19.8
 million, respectively. Changes in these assets are recorded in 
Other assets
 within operating activities

in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, and CCA assets are tested for recoverability only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In these cases, the Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset or asset group to determine whether the asset or asset group is recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an analysis is performed to estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group. An impairment is recorded if the fair value of the asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount.
Impairment charges of long-lived assets, if any, are classified as 
SG&A expenses
. During 2024, we tested certain long-lived assets for impairment at certain underperforming retail locations. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, impairment charges from underperforming retail stores were not material.
DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives were amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization were fully amortized as of December 31, 2024. 
INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL
The Company reviews and tests its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset or reporting unit is less than its 
 COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K  |

Table of Contents

Notes to 
Consolidated
 Financial Statements
carrying amount. The Company's intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trademarks and trade names. In the impairment tests for trademarks and trade names indefinite-lived intangibles, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each asset to its carrying amount. In the impairment test for goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of that reporting unit. For both indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as the excess of carrying amount over the estimate of fair value.
Impairment charges of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, if any, are classified as 
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
LEASES
The Company leases, among other things, retail space, office space, warehouse facilities, storage space, vehicles, and equipment. Generally, the initial lease terms are between 
5
 and 
10
 years. Certain lease agreements contain scheduled rent escalation clauses and others include rental payments adjusted periodically depending on an index or rate. Certain retail space lease agreements provide for additional rents based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of stipulated minimums ("percentage rent"). Certain lease agreements require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, and other costs, collectively referred to as operating costs, in addition to base rent. 
Certain lease agreements also contain lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 
one
 to 
10
 years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is generally at the Company's sole discretion. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a lease ROU asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines (1) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value, (2) the lease term and (3) lease payments.
Unpaid lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease because it does not have access to the lessor's estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor's deferred initial direct costs. Therefore, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company's incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Because the Company does not generally borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses market-based rates as an input to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for the lease term and the effect on that rate of designating specific collateral with a value equal to the unpaid lease payments for that lease. 
The Company's lease contracts may include options to extend the lease following the initial term or terminate the lease prior to the end of the initial term. In most instances, at the commencement of the leases, the Company has determined that it is not reasonably certain to exercise either of these options; accordingly, these options are generally not considered in determining the initial lease term. In instances where the Company exercises an option it had previously determined it was not reasonably certain to exercise, the Company reassesses any remaining options in the contract that it is reasonably certain to exercise in its measurement of the lease term.
For most lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842, the Company has elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Therefore, for those leases, the lease payments used to measure the lease liability include all of the fixed consideration in the contract.
Variable lease payments associated with the Company's leases are recognized upon occurrence of the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed. Variable lease payments are presented in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments, which is generally within 
SG&A expenses
. 
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are considered short-term leases and not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes lease expense for short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Notes to 
Consolidated
 Financial Statements
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are based on amounts of taxes payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future tax consequences of events that are recognized in the financial statements in different periods than they are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement differences between financial accounting standards and income tax laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pre-tax financial statement income and taxable income and between reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect estimated future tax effects attributable to these temporary differences and to net operating loss and net capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates expected to be in effect for years in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions. Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered likely to be realized.
Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include unrecognized income tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, classified as current or non-current. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. In making this determination, the Company assumes that the taxing authority will examine the position and that it will have full knowledge of all relevant information. Changes in the Company's assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period the assessment changes.
DERIVATIVES
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of outstanding cash flow hedges is recorded in 
Accumulated

other comprehensive income (loss)
 until earnings are affected by the hedged transaction, and any ineffective portion is included in earnings. In most cases, amounts recorded in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
 will be released to earnings after maturity of the related derivative. The Consolidated Statements of Operations classification of results from effective hedges is the same as that of the underlying exposure. Results of hedges of product costs are recorded in 
Cost of sales
 when the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings. Results of hedges of revenue are recorded in
 Net sales
 when the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings. Unrealized derivative gains and losses, which are recorded in assets and liabilities, respectively, are non-cash items and therefore are taken into account in the preparation of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows based on their respective balance sheet classifications.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For the Company's subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities have been translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at period end, and the sales and expenses have been translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. The foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are recognized when the Company's performance obligations are satisfied as evidenced by transfer of control of promised goods to customers or consumers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Within the Company's wholesale channel, control generally transfers to the customer upon shipment to, or upon receipt by, the customer depending on the terms of sale with the customer. Within the Company's direct-to-consumer ("DTC") channel, control generally transfers to the consumer at the time of sale within retail stores and concession-based arrangements and generally upon shipment to the consumer with respect to e-commerce transactions.
The amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive and recognize as 
Net sales 
across both wholesale and DTC channels varies with changes in sales returns, other accommodations and incentives offered. The Company estimates expected sales returns and other accommodations, such as chargebacks and markdowns, and records a sales reserve to reduce 
Net sales. 
These estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims, as well as events and circumstances that indicate changes to such historical rates are warranted. However, actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates. As a result, the Company adjusts estimates of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration the Company expects to receive changes or when the amount of consideration becomes fixed. If actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly different than the sales reserves established, the Company records an adjustment to 
Net sales 
in the period in which it made such determination.

Licensing income, which is presented separately as
 Net licensing income
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and represents less than 
1
% of total revenue, is recognized over time based on the greater of contractual minimum royalty guarantees and actual, or estimated, sales of licensed products by the Company's licensees.
The Company expenses sales commissions when incurred, which is generally at the time of sale, because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within 
SG&A expenses
.
Revenue recognized from contracts with customers is recorded net of sales taxes, value added taxes, or similar taxes that are collected on behalf of local taxing authorities.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Fees for shipping and handling activities which are billed to customers and consumers are recorded as 
Net Sales
. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer has obtained control of a good as fulfillment costs rather than an additional performance obligation. Freight costs associated with the shipment of goods to customers and consumers, including freight costs associated with the transfer of inventory within the Company's distribution network and to the Company's retail stores, are recorded as 
Cost of sales
.

Shipping and handling costs also include costs associated with the handling of inventory and warehousing costs associated with the operation of the Company's owned distribution centers and third-party logistics providers are recorded as 
SG&A expenses
, and were $
153.9
 million, $
183.2
 million and $
155.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales 
consists of all direct costs to source and purchase inventory, including product costs, freight, duties and other importation costs, as well as specific provisions for excess, close-out or slow-moving inventory. In addition, certain products carry life-time or limited warranty provisions for defects in quality and workmanship. 
Cost of sales
 includes a warranty reserve established for these provisions at the time of sale to cover estimated costs based on the Company's history of warranty repairs and replacements.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
SG&A expenses
 consists of personnel-related costs, advertising, depreciation and amortization, occupancy, warehousing, and other selling and general operating expenses related to the Company's business functions.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value. For stock options, time-based restricted stock units, and market-based restricted stock units, share-based compensation cost is recognized over the expected requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method. For equity-classified market-based restricted stock units, the probability of achieving the related market condition is incorporated into the grant date fair value. If targets are not met, no compensation cost will be reversed except in the case of award forfeitures. For performance-based restricted stock units, share-based compensation cost is recognized based on the Company's assessment of the probability of achieving the related performance targets. If such targets are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The Company estimates forfeitures for share-based awards granted, but which are not expected to vest.

ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs, including marketing and demand creation spending, are expensed in the period incurred and are included in 
SG&A expenses
. The Company may reimburse its customers for certain marketing activities at the Company's discretion. The costs for such activities are recorded as advertising costs when the Company has determined a payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service and approximates the fair value of the good or service received. Total advertising expense was $
198.7
 million, $
209.4

NOTE 6 — SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES
DOMESTIC CREDIT FACILITY
The Company has an unsecured, committed revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that provides for up to $
500.0
 million of borrowings, which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Facility matures on July 12, 2027. Interest, generally payable monthly, is based on the Company's option of either the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus an applicable margin or a base rate. Base rate is defined as the highest of the following, plus an applicable margin:
• the administrative agent's prime rate;
• the higher of the federal funds rate or overnight bank funding rate set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 
0.50
%; or
• the one-month SOFR plus 
1.00
%.
The applicable margin for SOFR loans will range from 
1.00
% to 
1.50
% based on the Company’s funded debt ratio. The applicable margin for base rate loans will range from 
0.00
% to 
0.50
% based on the Company’s funded debt ratio. A commitment fee ranging from 
0.10
% to 
0.20
% based on the Company's funded debt ratio is paid quarterly on the average daily unused commitment amount of the Credit Facility.

Notes to 
Consolidated
 Financial Statements
The agreement for the Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with a financial covenant to maintain a certain funded debt ratio. In addition, the agreement includes customary covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and liens, engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and engage in transactions with affiliates, as well as restrict the amount of certain payments, including dividends and share buybacks in the event the Company's funded debt ratio is greater than a set amount.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all associated covenants. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no balance outstanding.
INTERNATIONAL CREDIT FACILITY
The Company's European subsidiary has available an unsecured, committed line of credit, which is guaranteed by the Company, and provides for borrowing up to a maximum of €
4.4
 million (approximately US$
4.6
 million) as of December 31, 2024, with borrowings to accrue interest at a base rate plus

The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized.

In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
12.1
 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $
11.7
 million have a 15-year carryforward period and $
0.4
 million have an unlimited carryforward period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net operating losses result in deferred tax assets of $
2.6
 million and $
1.7
 million, respectively, and were subject to a valuation allowance of $
2.5
 million and $
0
, respectively.
As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had a foreign deferred tax asset of 
$
10.7
 million
, which is subject to a valuation allowance of 
$
8.2
 million
. As of December 31, 
2023
, the Company had a foreign deferred tax asset of 
$
9.4
 million
, which was subject to a valuation allowance of 
$
7.0
 million
.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had accumulated undistributed earnings generated by the Company's foreign subsidiaries of $
295.5
 million. These earnings have already been subject to U.S. tax, so any further taxes associated with such earnings would generally be limited to foreign withholding and state taxes. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for these, except in the jurisdictions where the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings.
UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS
The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the

world, including major jurisdictions such as Canada, China, France, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and the U.S.. The Company has effectively settled France tax examinations of all years through 2016, Canadian tax examinations of all years through 2018, China tax examinations of all years through 2018, U.S. tax examinations of all years through 2018, Japanese tax examinations of all years through 2019, and Swiss tax examinations of all years through 2019. The Korean National Tax Service concluded an audit of the Company's 2009 through 2013 corporate income tax returns in 2014, an audit of the Company's 2014 corporate income tax return in 2016, and an audit of 2016 through 2020 corporate income tax returns in 2022. Due to the nature of the findings in the 2009 through 2014 audits, the Company has invoked the Mutual Agreement Procedures outlined in the U.S.-Korean income tax treaty. The Company does not anticipate that adjustments relative to these findings, or any other ongoing tax audits, will result in material impacts to its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other than the findings and audits previously noted, the Company is not currently under examination in any other major jurisdiction.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Due to the potential for resolution of income tax audits currently in progress, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the twelve months following December 31, 2024 by a range of 
zero
 to $
1.7

Open tax years, including those previously mentioned, contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, timing, or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given examination cycle. 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $

NOTE 10 — RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS
401(K) PROFIT-SHARING PLAN
The Company has a 401(k) profit-sharing plan, which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Participation begins the first day of the quarter following completion of 
30
 days of service. The Company, with approval of the Board of Directors, may elect to make discretionary matching or non-matching contributions. Costs recognized for Company contributions to the pla
n were
 $

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
The Company sponsors a nonqualified retirement savings plan for certain senior management employees whose contributions to the tax qualified 401(k) plan would be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their salary and incentive compensation and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the deferred amounts. Costs recognized for Company matching contributions to the plan were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on investment earnings of participant-selected investments. Deferred compensation, including accumulated earnings on the participant-directe
d investment selections, is distributable in cash at participant-specified dates or upon retirement, death, disability, or termination of employment of the participant.

NOTE 11 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LITIGATION
The Company is involved in litigation and various legal matters arising in the normal course of business, including matters related to employment, retail, intellectual property, contractual agreements, and various regulatory compliance activities. Management has considered facts related to legal and regulatory matters and opinions of counsel handling these matters, and does not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 13 — SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
At its Annual Meeting held on June 3, 2020, the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”), and the 2020 Plan became effective on that date following such approval. The 2020 Plan replaced the Company’s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Prior Plan”) and no new awards will be granted under the Prior Plan. The terms and conditions of the awards granted under the Prior Plan will remain in effect with respect to awards granted under the Prior Plan. The Company has reserved 
3.0
 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2020 Plan, plus up to an aggregate of 
1.5
 million shares of the Company's common stock that were previously authorized and available for issuance under the Prior Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 
2,223,759
 shares were available for future grants under the 2020 Plan.
The Company's Stock Incentive Plan allows for grants of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and other share-based or cash-based awards to officers, executives, key employees and nonemployee members of the Company’s Board of Directors.

STOCK OPTIONS
Options to purchase the Company's common stock are granted at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest and become exercisable ratably on an annual basis over a period of 
four years
 and expire 
ten years
 from the date of the grant.
The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model. Key inputs and assumptions used in the model include the exercise price of the award, the expected option term, the expected stock price volatility of the Company's stock over the option's expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term, and the Company's expected annual dividend yield. The option's expected term is derived from historical option exercise behavior and the option's terms and conditions, which the Company believes provide a reasonable basis for estimating an expected term. The expected volatility is estimated based on observations of the Company's historical volatility over the most recent term commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield approximating the expected term. The dividend yield is based on the expected cash dividend payouts.
The weighted average assumptions for stock options granted and resulting fair value is as follows:

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
Time-Based Restricted Stock Units
The Company has historically disclosed its Restricted Stock Units footnote on an aggregated basis to include both time and performance-based restricted stock units. The Company’s performance-based restricted stock units, representing 
23,374
 outstanding shares as of December 31, 2023, and the corresponding weighted average grant date fair value assumptions, compensation expense recognized, and total fair value of shares vested have been disclosed separately between time and performance-based restricted stock units for all related periods presented to conform to current year presentation.
Time-based restricted stock units (“time-based RSUs”) are granted at no cost to officers, executives, key employees, and nonemployee members of the Company’s Board of Directors and generally vest over a period of 
four years
. Time-based RSUs granted to nonemployee members of the Company’s Board of Directors vest over a period of 
one year
. Time-based RSUs vest in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and are based on continued service. Dividend equivalents do not accrue on time-based RSUs.
The fair value of time-based RSUs is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends not received during the vesting period.

Other assumptions incorporated into the grant date fair value include the vesting period and the Company's expected annual dividend yield.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Performance-based restricted stock units (“performance-based RSUs”) are granted at no cost to certain members of the Company's executive team, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, and are subject to performance and time-based vesting conditions. The number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on the achievement of the multi-year financial performance targets set by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and, for some awards, the Company’s financial performance relative to certain comparator companies. The number of performance-based RSUs earned may be adjusted upward or downward, resulting in a minimum and maximum payout of 
0
% and 
200
%, respectively, based on actual performance.
Performance-based RSUs vest in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and are based on continued service and Company performance over a period of approximately 
two
 to 
three years
. Dividend equivalents do not accrue on performance-based RSUs. 
The grant date fair value of performance-based RSUs is determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends not received during the vesting period.

Other assumptions incorporated into the grant date fair value include the vesting period and the Company's expected annual dividend yield.
The weighted average assumptions for performance-based RSUs granted and resulting fair value is as follows:

Market-Based Restricted Stock Units
Market-based restricted stock units (“market-based RSUs”) are granted at no cost to certain members of the Company's executive team, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, and are subject to market and time-based vesting conditions. Market-based RSUs vest in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and are based on continued service and relative total shareholder return of the Company against a comparator group over a period of approximately

NOTE 14 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share ("EPS") is presented on both a basic and diluted basis. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
A reconciliation of the common shares used in the denominator for computing basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

NOTE 16 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company defines its operating segments on the basis of the way in which internally reported financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") to analyze performance, make decisions, and allocate resources. The Company aggregates its operating segments with similar economic and operating characteristics into 
four
 reportable segments: U.S., LAAP, EMEA, and Canada. These reportable segments are organized by geographic location. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing, and distribution of outdoor, active and lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment.
The Company’s CODM is the Company’s president and chief executive officer. The Company’s CODM assesses the segments’ performance by using each segment's operating income.
The CODM uses each segment's operating income to allocate resources predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODM considers plan-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis for the segment operating income profit measure when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. The CODM also uses this profit measure to assess the performance of each segment by comparing the results of each segment with one another, and in the overall strategic planning for each segment.
Intersegment net sales and intersegment profits, which are recorded at a negotiated mark-up and eliminated in consolidation, are not material. Unallocated corporate expenses consist of expenses incurred by centrally-managed departmental functions, including information technology, certain supply chain functions, finance, human resources and legal, as well as executive compensation, unallocated benefit program expense, and other miscellaneous costs.

NOTE 17 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
In the normal course of business, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows are routinely subject to a variety of risks. These risks include risks associated with financial markets, primarily currency exchange rate risk and, to a lesser extent, interest rate risk and equity market risk. The Company regularly assesses these risks and has established policies and business practices designed to mitigate them. The Company does not engage in speculative trading in any financial market.
The Company actively manages the risk of changes in functional currency equivalent cash flows resulting from anticipated non-functional currency denominated purchases and sales. Subsidiaries that use European euros, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, or Korean won as their functional currency are primarily exposed to changes in functional currency equivalent cash flows from anticipated U.S. dollar inventory purchases. Subsidiaries that use U.S. dollars and euros as their functional currency also have non-functional currency denominated sales for which the Company hedges the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The Company seeks to manage these risks by using currency forward contracts formally designated and effective as cash flow hedges. Hedge effectiveness is generally determined by evaluating the ability of a hedging instrument's cumulative change in fair value to offset the cumulative change in the present value of expected cash flows on the underlying exposures. Time value components ("forward points") for forward contracts are included in the fair value of the cash flow hedge. These costs or benefits are included in 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
 until the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in either
 Net sales
 or
 Cost of sales
, at which time, the forward points will also be recognized as a component of 
Net income
. 
The Company also uses currency forward contracts not formally designated as hedges to manage the consolidated currency exchange rate risk associated with the remeasurement of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities by subsidiaries that use U.S. dollars, euros, Canadian dollars, yen, renminbi, or won as their functional currency. Non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities consists of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, payables, deferred income taxes, and intercompany loans and dividends. The gains and losses generated on these currency forward contracts not formally designated as hedges are expected to be largely offset in 
Other non-operating income (expense), net 
by the gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.

 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are dependent on U.S. dollar exchange rates in effect against the euro, renminbi, Canadian dollar, won, and yen as well as the euro exchange rate in effect against the pound sterling.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company's derivative contracts had a remaining maturity of less than 
3
 years. The maximum net exposure to any single counterparty, which is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized gain of all contracts with that counterparty, was $
11.8
 million as of December 31, 2024. All of the Company's derivative counterparties have credit ratings that are investment grade or higher. The Company is a party to master netting arrangements that contain features that allow counterparties to net settle amounts arising from multiple separate derivative transactions or net settle in the case of certain triggering events such as a bankruptcy or major default of one of the counterparties to the transaction. The Company has not pledged assets or posted collateral as a requirement for entering into or maintaining derivative positions.

NOTE 18 — FAIR VALUE MEASURES
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, under a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
Level 1 
—
observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active liquid markets; 
Level 2
—
inputs, other than the quoted market prices in active markets, that are observable, either directly or indirectly; or observable market prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions; and 
Level 3
—
unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, that require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
The Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized as Level 1 or Level 2 instruments. Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from inputs, other than quoted market prices in active markets, that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace and quoted prices in markets with limited volume or infrequent transactions.

NON-RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measured the fair value of certain trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as part of impairment testing for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets are primarily significant unobservable inputs and, as such, considered Level 3 fair value measurements. Refer to Note 5 in Part II, Item 8 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
NOTE 19 — SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING
In the third quarter of 2024, the Company began to offer a voluntary supply chain financing (“SCF”) program facilitated through a third-party service provider. Under the program, participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to receive payment from a select number of third-party financial institutions for one or more of the Company’s valid payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates. The Company is not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the program. The Company’s payment terms, including the timing and amount of payments, are based on the original supplier invoices, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. The Company does not have an economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the program and has not pledged any assets as security or provided any guarantees as part of the program.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report. These disclosure controls and procedures require information to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports to be (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Based on our evaluation, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that as of December 31, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
. Based on our assessment, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
