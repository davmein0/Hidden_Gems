Overview
The Company operates as a super-community bank and offers a broad range of financial products to consumer, municipal,  and commercial customers, delivered with a focus on high-quality, personalized service. The Company is headquartered in Missouri, with its principal offices in Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri.

A variety of delivery platforms are utilized, including an extensive network of branches and ATM machines, full-featured online banking, a mobile application, and a centralized contact center.

To achieve this growth, the Company focuses on strategies that will expand new and existing customer relationships, offer opportunities for controlled expansion in additional markets, utilize improved technology, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Various indicators are used by management in evaluating the Company’s financial condition and operating performance.  Among these indicators are the following:
•    Net income and earnings per share — Net income attributable to Commerce Bancshares, Inc. during 2024 was $526.3 million, an increase of 10.3% compared to the previous year.  The return on average assets was 1.72% in 2024, and the return on average common equity was 16.66%.  Diluted earnings per share increased 11.8% in 2024 compared to 2023.
•    Total revenue — Total revenue is comprised of net interest income and non-interest income.  Total revenue in 2024 increased $84.6 million, or 5.4%, from 2023, as net interest income grew $42.1 million, and non-interest income increased $42.5 million.  Growth in net interest income resulted principally from increases in interest income from loans, partly offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits.  The increase in non-interest income in 2024 was mainly due to higher trust fees, supplemented by higher deposit account fees and capital market fees.
•    Non-interest expense — Total non-interest expense increased 2.2% this year compared to 2023, mainly due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense, partially offset by lower deposit insurance expense due to a special FDIC assessment accrued in 2023.
•    Asset quality — Net loan charge-offs totaled $38.9 million in 2024, an increase of $7.8 million from those recorded in 2023, and averaged .23% of loans in 2024, as compared to .19% of loans in 2023.  Total non-performing assets, which include non-accrual loans and foreclosed real estate, amounted to $18.6 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $7.6 million at December 31, 2023, and represented .11% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2024.
•    Shareholder return — During 2024, the Company paid cash dividends of $1.03 per share on its common stock, representing an increase of 5.0% over the previous year.  In 2024, the Company issued its 31st consecutive annual 5%

common stock dividend, and in February 2025, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase of 7.0% in the common cash dividend.  The Company purchased 2,875,349 shares in 2024.  Total shareholder return, including the change in stock price and dividend reinvestment, was 5.1%, 10.8%, and 10.7% over the past 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively.

Net income attributable to Commerce Bancshares, Inc. (net income) for 2024 was $526.3 million, an increase of $49.3 million, or 10.3%, compared to $477.1 million in 2023.  Diluted income per common share was $3.87 in 2024, compared to $3.46 in 2023.  The growth in net income resulted mainly from increases of $42.5 million in non-interest income and $42.1 million in net interest income, partly offset by increases in non-interest expense and income taxes of $20.2 million and $10.5 million, respectively.  The return on average assets was 1.72% in 2024 compared to 1.49% in 2023, and the return on average common equity was 16.66% in 2024 compared to 17.94% in 2023.  At December 31, 2024, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to 9.92%, compared to 8.85% at year end 2023.  
During 2024, net interest income grew mainly due to an increase of $78.4 million in interest income earned on loans, mainly due to higher average rates, and a decrease of $43.9 million in interest expense on borrowings, mainly due to lower average balances, partly offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits of $90.0 million, mainly due to higher average rates paid.  Total rates earned on average interest earning assets increased 52 basis points this year, while funding costs increased 52 basis points for deposits and decreased 28 basis points for borrowings.  The provision for credit losses increased mainly due to higher net loan charge-offs and an increase in the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on loans this year compared to last year.  These increases were partly offset by a decrease in the liability for unfunded lending commitments.  Net loan charge-offs increased $7.8 million, mainly due to higher credit card and consumer loan net charge-offs in 2024, partly offset by a decrease in business loan net charge-offs.
Non-interest income grew 7.4% in 2024, mainly due to increases in trust fees and deposit account fees.  Net investment securities gains of $7.8 million were recorded in 2024 and were comprised mainly of gains on the sales of equity securities, partly offset by losses on sales of available for sale debt securities.  Non-interest expense increased $20.2 million in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly due to higher salaries and benefits expense and data processing and software expense, partly offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense.
Net income for 2023 was $477.1 million, a decrease of $11.3 million, or 2.3%, compared to $488.4 million in 2022.  Diluted income per common share was $3.46 in 2023, compared to $3.50 in 2022.  The decrease in net income resulted mainly from an increase of $82.2 million in non-interest expense, partly offset by increases in net interest income of $55.9 million and non-interest income of $26.5 million.  The return on average assets was 1.49% in 2023 compared to 1.45% in 2022, and the return on average common equity was 17.94% in 2023 compared to 17.31% in 2022.  At December 31, 2023, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to 8.85%, compared to 7.32% at year end 2022.  
During 2023, net interest income grew mainly due to increases of $338.1 million in interest income earned on loans and $88.2 million in interest income earned on deposits with banks, mainly due to higher average rates, partly offset by increases in interest expense on deposits and borrowings of $215.7 million and $110.2 million, respectively, mainly due to higher average rates paid.  Total rates earned on average interest earning assets increased 134 basis points in 2023, while funding costs for deposits and borrowings increased 156 basis points.  The provision for credit losses increased mainly due to higher net loan charge-offs and an increase in the estimate of the allowance for credit losses in 2023 compared to 2022.  Net loan charge-offs increased $12.0 million, mainly due to higher credit card, consumer and business loan net charge-offs in 2023.
Non-interest income grew 4.9% in 2023, mainly due to increases in bank card and trust fees.  Net investment securities gains of $15.0 million were recorded in 2023 and were comprised mainly of net fair value gains on the Company's private equity

investment portfolio, partly offset by losses on sales of available for sale securities.  Non-interest expense increased $82.2 million in 2023 compared to 2022, mainly due to higher salaries and benefits expense and deposit insurance expense.
The Company distributed a 5% stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year on December 18, 2024.  All per share and average share data in this report has been restated for the 2024 stock dividend. 
Critical Accounting Estimates and Related Policies
The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations which may significantly affect the Company's reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value.  Current economic conditions may require the use of additional estimates, and some estimates may be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty due to the current instability of the economy. The Company has identified several policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These estimates and related policies are the Company's allowance for credit losses and fair value measurement policies.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company's Allowance for Credit Losses policies govern the processes and procedures used to estimate the collectability of its loan portfolio and unfunded lending commitments, and the potential for credit losses in its available for sale debt securities portfolio.  
Allowance for Credit Losses – Loans and Unfunded Lending Commitments
The Company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio and unfunded lending commitments to assess overall collectability. The level of the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded lending commitments reflects the Company's estimate of the losses expected in the loan portfolio and unfunded lending commitments over the assets’ contractual term.
The allowance for credit loss is an estimate that is subject to uncertainty due to the various assumptions and judgments used in the estimation process. 
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis.  Loans are aggregated into pools based on similar risk characteristics including borrower type, collateral type and expected credit loss patterns. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, primarily large loans on non-accrual status, are evaluated on an individual basis.  
The allowance for credit losses is measured using an average historical loss model which incorporates relevant information about past events (including historical credit loss experience on loans with similar risk characteristics), current conditions, and an economic forecast that may affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the loans.  The calculated loss rate is increased or decreased to reflect expectations of future losses given a single path economic forecast. These adjustments to the loss rate are based on results from various regression models projecting the impact of the macroeconomic variables.  The forecast is used for a reasonable and supportable period before reverting to historical averages using a straight-line method.  
Additionally, the allowance for credit losses considers other qualitative factors not included in historical loss rates or macroeconomic forecast such as changes in portfolio composition, underwriting practices, or significant unique events or conditions.
Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made by increases to or reductions in the provision for credit losses, which are reflected in the consolidated statements of income.
Assumptions, Judgments, and Uncertainties:
  The uncertainty in the estimation of the allowance for credit losses is created because key assumptions and judgements are applied throughout the process.  Key assumptions include segmentation of the portfolio into pools, calculations of life of a loan using a combination of contractual terms and expected prepayment speeds and forecast of macroeconomic conditions. The Company utilizes a third-party macro-economic forecast that continuously changes due to economic conditions and events.  The single path economic forecast includes key 
25
Table of Contents
macroeconomic variables including GDP, disposable income, unemployment rate, various interest rates, consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate, housing price index (HPI), commercial real estate price index (CREPI) and market volatility.  Each reporting period, the base macroeconomic forecast scenario is evaluated to ensure it is not inconsistent with management’s expectations. Changes in the forecast cause fluctuations in the estimates of the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments. Potential changes in any one economic variable 
may or may not
 affect the overall allowance because a variety of economic variables and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance, and changes in those variables and inputs may not occur at the same rate, may not be consistent across product types and may have offsetting impacts to other changing variables and inputs.  
Data points such as loan mix, level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance, line utilization trends and risk ratings change throughout the life of a portfolio which could cause changes to the expected credit losses. 
Qualitative factors not included in historical information or macroeconomic forecast require significant judgment to identify and determine how to apply to the estimate for credit losses. The qualitative factors continuously evolve in reaction to other changing assumptions, data inputs and industry trends.
The Company uses its best judgment to assess the macroeconomic forecast, key assumptions and internal and external data in estimating the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments.  These estimates are subject to continuous refinement based on changes in the underlying external and internal data.
Impact if actual results differ from assumptions
:  The allowance for credit losses represents management’s best estimate of expected current credit losses in the loan portfolio and within the Company’s unfunded lending commitments, but changes in the inputs and assumptions described above could significantly impact the calculated estimated credit losses.  Therefore, actual credit losses may differ significantly from estimated results. Significant deterioration in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance.  Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may require a reduction in the allowance for credit losses.  In either instance, changes could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Available for Sale Debt Securities 
The level of the allowance for credit losses on available for sale securities reflects the Company’s estimate of the losses expected in the available for sale debt security portfolio.  In order to estimate the allowance for credit losses on available for sale debt securities, the Company performs quarterly reviews of its investment portfolio to identify securities in an unrealized loss position. 
Changes to the allowance for credit losses are made by changes to or reductions in the provision for credit losses, which are reflected in the consolidated statements of income.
Assumptions, Judgments, and Uncertainties:
  Securities for which fair value is less than amortized cost are reviewed for impairment.  Special emphasis is placed on securities whose credit rating has fallen below Baa3 (Moody's) or BBB- (Standard & Poor's), whose fair values have fallen more than 20% below purchase price, or those which have been identified based on management’s judgment.  These securities are placed on a watch list and cash flow analyses are prepared on an individual security basis. Certain securities are analyzed using a projected cash flow model, discounted to present value, and compared to the current amortized cost bases of the securities. The model uses input factors such as cash flow projections, contractual payments required, expected delinquency rates, credit support from other tranches, prepayment speeds, collateral loss severity rates (including loan to values), and various other information related to the underlying collateral. Securities not analyzed using the cash flow model are analyzed by reviewing risk ratings, credit support agreements, and industry knowledge to project future cash flows and any possible credit impairment.
Impact if actual results differ from assumptions
:  The allowance for credit losses represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses in the available for sale debt securities portfolio, but significant change in interest rates and deterioration in economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance.  Likewise, an increase in interest rates and improved economic conditions may require a reduction in the allowance for credit losses.  In either instance, anticipated changes could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Fair Value Measurement
Investment securities, including available for sale debt, trading, equity and other securities, residential mortgage loans held for sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.  Additionally, from time to time, other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as 
26
Table of Contents
loan values that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), non-marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting.
Assumptions, Judgments, and Uncertainties:
  Fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction (i.e., not a forced transaction, such as a liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 
Fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs. Fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (Level 1 valuations). If market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (Level 2 valuations). Where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market (Level 3 valuations). Unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques typically include discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.
The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value. Considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.
For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, the Company looks to active and observable market data when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market. Certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and the Company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive an estimated fair value measurement.  In doing so, the Company may be required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. The assumptions used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances.
Changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When market data is not available, the Company uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.
Impairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets and core deposit and other intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed.
At December 31, 2024, assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 represented 98.1% and 99.9% of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, respectively.  Valuations generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market are considered Level 3, and the Company's Level 3 assets totaled $185.4 million, or 2.0% of total assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value hierarchy, the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, and the valuation methodologies and key inputs used are discussed in Note 17 on Fair Value Measurements.
Impact if actual results differ from assumptions
:  Changes in fair value are recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income.  Adjustments in the inputs and assumptions described above could significantly impact the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities and have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Net interest income totaled $1.0 billion in 2024, increasing $42.1 million, or 4.2%, compared to $998.1 million in 2023.  On a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, net interest income totaled $1.0 billion, and increased $42.8 million over 2023.  This growth was due to increases of $79.6 million in interest earned on loans (FTE), due to higher average rates and balances, and $18.2 million in interest earned on balances at the Federal Reserve, due to higher average balances, and a decrease of $44.8 million in interest expense on borrowings, mainly due to lower average balances.  These increases to income were partly offset by an increase of $90.0 million in interest expense on deposits, mainly due to higher average rates paid, and lower interest earned on investment securities of $8.5 million, due to lower average balances, partly offset by higher average rates.  The net yield on earning assets (FTE) was 3.47% in 2024 compared with 3.16% in 2023. The fully taxable-equivalent basis uses a federal income tax rate of 21%.
28
Table of Contents
During 2024, loan interest income (FTE) grew $79.6 million over 2023 mainly due to an increase in rates earned for all loan categories and growth of $310.2 million, or 1.8%, in average loan balances.  The average fully taxable-equivalent rate earned on the loan portfolio increased 36 basis points to 6.26% in 2024 compared to 5.90% in 2023.  The higher rates earned on the loan portfolio were impacted by actions taken by the Federal Reserve in 2024 to lower short-term interest rates, which caused most of the Company's variable rate loan portfolio to re-price lower and fixed rate loans to originate at lower interest rates than the weighted-average of the portfolio of fixed rate loans.  Increased interest earned on business, consumer, personal real estate and business real estate loans was the main driver of overall higher loan interest income.  Business loan interest income increased $33.3 million due to a 40 basis point increase in the average rate earned and an increase of $164.3 million, or 2.84%, in average balances.  Interest earned on consumer loans increased $16.2 million mainly due to an increase of 74 basis points in the average rate earned.  Personal real estate loan interest grew $13.0 million in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of an increase of 35 basis points in the average rate earned and higher average balances of $63.8 million, or 2.14%.  Interest on construction and land loans grew $1.3 million over the prior year due to growth in the average rate earned of 29 basis points, partly offset by a decrease of $35.0 million, or 2.4%, in average loan balances.  Interest on business real estate loans increased $12.5 million as the average rate earned increased 21 basis points and the average balance grew $75.3 million, or 2.1%.  Revolving home equity loan interest increased $2.5 million mainly due to growth in average balances of $30.7 million, or 10.1%.  Interest on consumer credit card loans was higher by $829 thousand due to an increase of 16 basis points in the average rate earned.  
Fully taxable-equivalent interest income on total investment securities decreased $8.5 million during 2024, as average balances declined $1.9 billion, while the average rate earned increased 34 basis points.  The average rate on the total investment securities portfolio was 2.63% in 2024 compared to 2.29% in 2023, while the average balance of the total investment securities portfolio (excluding unrealized fair value adjustments on available for sale debt securities) was $10.4 billion in 2024 compared to an average balance of $12.4 billion in 2023.  The decrease in interest income was mainly due to lower interest income earned on mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and state and municipal securities, partly offset by an higher interest income earned on U.S. government securities.  Interest earned on mortgage-backed securities decreased $16.2 million due to lower average balances of $878.4 million, slightly offset by an increase of three basis points in the average rate earned.  Interest earned on asset-backed securities decreased $12.8 million, due to a decline in average balances of $991.4 million, partly offset by an increase of 48 basis points in the average rate earned. The decrease of $10.9 million in interest earned on state and municipal securities was due to a decrease of $497.5 million in average balances and a decline of seven basis points in average rate earned.  Interest earned on U.S. government securities increased $35.9 million mainly due to higher average balances of $601.7 million, or 60.0%, and an increase in average rate earned of 130 basis points.  Interest earned on U.S. government securities was impacted by a decline of $2.5 million in inflation income on treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).  
Interest on federal funds sold decreased $610 thousand and interest on securities purchased under resell agreements decreased $291 thousand compared to 2023 both due to declines in average balances, partly offset by growth in the average rate earned.  Interest income on balances at the Federal Reserve increased $18.2 million over 2023, due to growth in average balances of $344.8 million, or 17.6%.
During 2024, interest expense on deposits increased $90.0 million over 2023 and resulted mainly from a 52 basis point increase in the overall average rate paid on deposits.  Interest expense on interest checking and money market accounts increased $80.5 million due to higher rates paid, which grew 59 basis points, and growth in average balances of $226.3 million, or 1.7%.  Interest expense on certificates of deposit grew $9.5 million, due to a 33 basis point increase in the average rate paid, coupled with a $33.1 million increase in average balances.  The overall rate paid on total deposits increased from 1.44% in 2023 to 1.96% in the current year.  Interest expense on borrowings decreased $44.8 million mainly due to a $975.0 million decrease in average balances.  Interest expense on federal funds purchased decreased $13.0 million, mainly due to a $265.7 million decline in average balances, while interest expense on securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $7.7 million due to a 26 basis point increase in average rate earned and an increase of $47.4 million in average balances.  Interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings declined $39.5 million due to a decline of $756.7 million in average balances.  The Company did not have any outstanding FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2024.  The overall average rate incurred on all interest bearing liabilities was 2.17% in 2024, compared to 1.86% in 2023.  
Net interest income totaled $998.1 million in 2023, increasing $55.9 million, or 5.9%, compared to $942.2 million in 2022.  On a FTE basis, net interest income totaled $1.0 billion, and increased $54.9 million over 2022.  This growth was mainly due to increases of $339.4 million in interest earned on loans and $88.2 million in interest earned on balances at the Federal Reserve, both mainly due to higher average rates earned.  These increases were partly offset by an increase of $325.9 million in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, mainly due to higher average rates paid, and lower interest earned on investment securities of $38.0 million, mainly due to lower average balances.  The net yield on earning assets (FTE) was 3.16% in 2023 compared with 2.85% in 2022. 
29
Table of Contents
During 2023, loan interest income (FTE) grew $339.4 million over 2022 mainly due to an increase in rates earned for all loan categories and a $1.2 billion, or 7.8%, increase in average loan balances.  The average fully taxable-equivalent rate earned on the loan portfolio increased 172 basis points to 5.90% in 2023 compared to 4.18% in 2022.  The higher rates earned on the loan portfolio were partly related to actions taken by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates during 2022 and 2023, which caused most of the Company's variable rate loan portfolio to re-price higher.  Additionally, fixed rate loans were generally originated in 2023 at higher interest rates than the weighted-average of the portfolio of fixed rate loans.  Increased interest earned on business, business real estate and construction and land loans was the main driver of overall higher interest income.  Business loan interest income increased $128.3 million due to a 196 basis point increase in the average rate earned and an increase of $405.2 million, or 7.5%, in average balances.  Business real estate loan interest grew $80.2 million in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of an increase of 181 basis points in the average rate earned and higher average balances of $372.0 million, or 11.6%.  Interest earned on construction and land loans increased $55.3 million due to an increase of 292 basis points in the average rate earned and growth of $243.8 million, or 19.8%, in average balances.  Interest on personal real estate loans increased $15.9 million as the average rate earned increased 38 basis points and the average balance grew $137.4 million.  Interest on consumer loans grew $37.3 million over 2022 as the average rate earned increased 174 basis points.  Revolving home equity loan interest increased $10.2 million due to an increase of 301 basis points in the average rate earned and growth in average balances of $22.7 million.  Interest on consumer credit card loans was higher by $12.4 million due to an increase of 191 basis points in the average rate earned and a $14.0 million increase in average balances.
Fully taxable-equivalent interest income on total investment securities decreased $38.0 million during 2023, as average balances declined $2.6 billion, while the average rate earned increased 14 basis points.  The average rate on the total investment securities portfolio was 2.29% in 2023 compared to 2.15% in 2022, while the average balance of the total investment securities portfolio (excluding unrealized fair value adjustments on available for sale debt securities) was $12.4 billion in 2023 compared to an average balance of $14.9 billion in 2022.  The decrease in interest income was mainly due to lower interest income earned on U.S. government securities, state and municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities.  Interest earned on U.S. government securities decreased $16.2 million mainly due to lower TIPS interest income of $14.3 million.  Average balances of U.S. government securities decreased $96.0 million and the average rate earned declined 125 basis points.  The decrease of $15.8 million in interest earned on state and municipal securities was due to a decrease of $542.8 million in average balances and a decline of 23 basis points in average rate earned.  Interest earned on mortgage-backed securities decreased $7.0 million due to a lower average balances of $742.6 million, partly offset by an increase of 12 basis points in the average rate earned.  Interest earned on asset-backed securities decreased $398 thousand, due to a decline in average balances of $1.2 billion, mostly offset by an increase of 62 basis points in the average rate earned.
Interest on securities purchased under resell agreements decreased $9.0 million compared to 2022 due to a decrease in average balances of $793.8 million, partly offset by growth of 43 basis points in the average rate.  Interest income on balances at the Federal Reserve increased $88.2 million over 2022, mainly due to a 416 basis point increase in the average rate earned and growth in average balances of $597.3 million.
During 2023, interest expense on deposits increased $215.7 million over 2022 and resulted mainly from a 126 basis point increase in the overall average rate paid on deposits.  Interest expense on interest checking and money market accounts increased $121.3 million mainly due to higher rates paid, which grew 94 basis points, slightly offset by lower average balances of $1.4 billion.  Interest expense on certificates of deposit grew $94.4 million, mainly due to a 350 basis point increase in the average rate paid, coupled with a $1.4 billion increase in average balances.  The overall rate paid on total deposits increased from .18% in 2022 to 1.44% in 2023.  Interest expense on borrowings increased $110.2 million mainly due to a 210 basis point increase in the rate paid on securities sold under repurchase agreements and an increase in $711.3 million in average FHLB borrowings.  The Company did not have any outstanding FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2023.  The overall average rate incurred on all interest bearing liabilities was 1.86% in 2023, compared to .30% in 2022.   
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses is comprised of provisions for credit losses on loans and unfunded lending commitments and is recorded to adjust the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments to a level deemed adequate by management based on the factors mentioned in the “Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Liability for Unfunded Lending Commitments” section of this discussion.  The provision for credit losses was $32.9 million in 2024, a decrease of $2.5 million from the 2023 provision.  
 The provision for credit losses on loans for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $39.2 million, compared to $43.3 million in 2023.  The allowance for credit losses on loans totaled $162.7 million at December 31, 2024, an increase of $347 thousand compared to the prior year, and represented .95% of loans at year end 2024, compared to .94% at December 31, 2023.

Non-interest income totaled $615.6 million, an increase of $42.5 million, or 7.4%, compared to $573.0 million in 2023.  Trust fee income increased $23.5 million, or 12.3%, mainly as a result of higher private client trust fees (up 13.1%), which comprised 81.0% of trust fee income in 2024.  The market value of total customer trust assets totaled $74.8 billion at year end 2024, which was an increase of 8.6% over year end 2023 balances.  Bank card fees decreased $1.4 million, or .7%, from the prior year, mainly due to a decrease in net corporate card fees of $4.0 million, partly offset by increases in net credit card fees of $1.6 million, net debit card fees of $636 thousand and net merchant fees of $407 thousand.  The decline in net corporate card fees from the prior year was mainly due to lower interchange income coupled with higher rewards expense.  Net debit card fees increased mainly due to higher interchange income, while net credit card fees increased due to lower rewards expense.  Net merchant fees increased mainly due to higher merchant discount fees, partly offset by lower interchange fees.  Deposit account fees increased $9.3 million, or 10.3%, mainly due to higher corporate cash management fees of $8.5 million and other deposit fees of $894 thousand.  In 2024, corporate cash management fees comprised 64.6% of total deposit fees, while overdraft fees comprised 11.5% of total deposit fees.  Capital markets fees increased $5.7 million, or 40.3%, mainly due to higher trading securities income of $4.1 million and underwriting income of $2.4 million.  Revenue from consumer brokerage services increased $918 thousand, or 5.3%, mainly due to higher annuity fees, while loan fees and sales increased $1.7 million, or 15.5%, mainly due to higher loan commitment fees and mortgage banking revenue.  Other non-interest income increased $2.7 million, or 4.8%, over the prior year mainly due to higher gains on asset sales of $2.5 million, cash sweep commissions of $2.2 million and tax credit sales income of $2.1 million.  These increases were partly offset by lower letter of credit fees of $2.3 million and swap fees of $1.2 million.
During 2023, non-interest income totaled $573.0 million, an increase of $26.5 million, or 4.9%, compared to $546.5 million in 2022.    Bank card fees increased $15.0 million, or 8.5%, over 2022, mainly due to increases in net corporate card fees of $10.6 million, net debit card fees of $2.9 million and net merchant fees of $1.6 million.  The growth in net corporate card fees over 2022 was mainly due to lower rewards and network expense coupled with higher interchange income.  Net debit card fees increased mainly due to lower network expense, while net merchant fees increased mainly due to higher merchant discount fees.  Trust fee income increased $6.2 million, or 3.4%, as a result of higher private client trust fees (up 4.3%), which comprised 80.4% of trust fee income in 2023.  The market value of total customer trust assets totaled $68.9 billion at year end 2023, which was an increase of 14.2% over year end 2022 balances.  Deposit account fees decreased $3.4 million, or 3.6%,

Table of Contents
mainly due to lower overdraft and return item fees of $8.3 million, partly offset by growth in corporate cash management fees of $3.8 million.  In 2023, corporate cash management fees comprised 61.9% of total deposit fees, while overdraft fees comprised 12.8% of total deposit fees.  Revenue from consumer brokerage services decreased $1.9 million, or 9.9%, mainly due to lower annuity fees, while loan fees and sales decreased $2.0 million, or 15.0%, mainly due to lower mortgage banking revenue.  Other non-interest income increased $12.7 million, or 28.2%, over 2022 mainly due to higher letter of credit fees of $3.2 million, cash sweep commissions of $2.9 million, gains on the sale of real estate of $2.1 million and swap fees of $1.1 million.  In addition, increases of $6.4 million in fair value adjustments were recorded on the Company's deferred compensation plan, which are held in a trust and recorded as both an asset and a liability, affecting both other income and other expense.  These increases were partly offset by lower tax credit sales income of $2.4 million.

Net gains and losses on investment securities during 2024, 2023 and 2022 are shown in the table above.  Included in these amounts are gains and losses arising from sales of securities from the Company’s available for sale debt portfolio, net gains and losses on equity securities, and gains and losses relating to private equity investments, which are primarily held by the Parent’s majority-owned private equity subsidiary.  The gains and losses on private equity investments include fair value adjustments, in addition to gains and losses realized upon disposition.  The portions of private equity investment gains and losses that are attributable to minority interests are reported as non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of income, and resulted in expense of $4.2 million in 2024, $4.8 million in 2023, and $8.5 million in 2022. 
Net securities gains of $7.8 million were recorded in 2024, which included net gains of $178.1 million on equity securities, net gains of $24.1 million in fair value adjustments on private equity investments, and net gains of $1.9 million on sales of private equity investments.  These gains were offset by net losses of $196.3 million realized on sales of available for sale debt securities resulting from the Company's sale of approximately $1.3 billion (book value) in bonds, mainly state and municipal, mortgage-backed, and corporate debt securities.   
Net securities gains of $15.0 million were recorded in 2023, which included net gains of $24.0 million in fair value adjustments on private equity investments.  This increase was partly offset by losses of $8.4 million realized on sales of available for sale debt securities resulting from the Company's sale of approximately $1.1 billion (book value) in bonds, mainly state and municipal securities and asset-backed securities, net losses of $100 thousand on sales of private equity investments, and net losses of $487 thousand on equity securities.
Net securities gains of $20.5 million were recorded in 2022, which included net gains of $43.8 million in fair value adjustments on private equity investments.  This increase was partly offset by losses of $20.3 million realized on sales of available for sale debt securities resulting from the Company's sale of approximately $105 million (book value) in bonds, mainly mortgage-backed and corporate bond securities, net losses of $2.1 million on sales of private equity investments, and net losses of $926 thousand on equity securities.
The Company's significant gains in equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily relate to gains recorded on its shares of Visa, as described in Note 3, Investment Securities.  Likewise, the $196.3 million losses realized on the Company's available for sale debt securities portfolio mainly relate to the successful execution of its planned available for sale debt security portfolio repositioning, in which the Company sold bonds with an amortized cost of $1.2 billion and subsequently reinvested the proceeds into higher yielding available for sale debt securities.  Additional information about the Company's available for sale debt portfolio repositioning transactions is discussed in Note 3, Investment Securities.

Non-interest expense was $951.2 million in 2024, an increase of $20.2 million, or 2.2%, over the previous year.  Salaries and benefits expense increased $23.8 million, or 4.1%, mainly due to higher costs for full-time salaries, incentive compensation, payroll taxes and 401(k) expense, slightly offset by lower contract labor expense.  Full-time equivalent employees totaled 4,693 at December 31, 2024, compared to 4,718 at December 31, 2023.  Data processing and software expense increased $8.6 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to increased costs for service providers and higher software expense and bank card processing fees.  Net occupancy expense decreased $406 thousand, or .8%, mainly due to higher external rent income, partly offset by higher building depreciation expense.  Professional and other services expense decreased $1.1 million, or 3.1%, mainly due to declines in other professional fees, loan collection fees, and pension plan expense, partly offset by an increase in legal fees.  Marketing expense decreased $2.2 million, or 8.8%, while equipment expense increased $1.1 million, or 5.5%, mainly due to higher furniture and equipment depreciation expense.  Supplies and communication expense decreased $129 thousand, or .7%, while deposit insurance expense decreased $16.7 million due to a $16.0 million accrual recorded in 2023 for a one-time special assessment by the FDIC to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund.  Other non-interest expense increased $7.2 million, or 17.4%, mainly due to litigation settlement expense of $10.0 million and a $5.0 million donation to a related charitable foundation, both recorded in 2024.  These increases were partly offset by deconversion costs of $2.1 million recorded in 2023, as well as decreases in swap fee amortization expense of $859 thousand, travel and entertainment expense of $687 thousand and recruiting expense of $489 thousand.
In 2023, non-interest expense was $931.0 million in 2023, an increase of $82.2 million, or 9.7%, over 2022.  Salaries and benefits expense increased $30.0 million, or 5.4%, mainly due to higher costs for full-time salaries, healthcare expense and payroll taxes, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense.  Full-time equivalent employees totaled 4,718 at December 31, 2023, compared to 4,594 at December 31, 2022.  Data processing and software expense increased $8.1 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to increased costs for service providers and higher bank card processing fees.  Net occupancy expense increased $4.5 million, or 9.2%, mainly due to higher depreciation expense and real estate taxes, partly offset by higher rent income.  Deposit insurance expense increased $22.6 million due to a $16.0 million one-time special assessment accrual recorded the fourth quarter of 2023, mentioned above.  Professional and other services expense increased $393 thousand, or 1.1%, mainly due to higher pension plan expense, partly offset by lower loan collection fees.  Marketing expense increased $684 thousand, or 2.9%, while supplies and communication expense increased $1.3 million, or 7.3%, mainly due to higher postage expense, bank card reissuance fees and office supplies expense.  Other non-interest expense increased $14.4 million, or 53.0%, mainly due to higher costs for travel and entertainment expense (up $1.9 million), miscellaneous losses (up $2.1 million) and lower deferred origination costs (up $1.6 million).  In addition, an increase of $6.4 million in fair value adjustments were recorded on the Company's deferred compensation plan, and deconversion costs of $2.1 million relating to the transition of Commerce Financial Advisors support to LPL Financial's Institution Services platform were recorded in 2023.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $145.1 million in 2024, compared to $134.5 million in 2023 and $132.4 million in 2022.  The effective tax rate, including the effect of non-controlling interest, was 21.6% in 2024 compared to 22.0% in 2023 and 21.3% in 2022.  The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2024 compared to the rate for 2023 was mostly due to lower state and local income taxes.  Additional information about income tax expense is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

Total loans at December 31, 2024 were $17.2 billion, an increase of $14.6 million, or 0.1%, over balances at December 31, 2023.  The increase in loans during 2024 occurred mainly due to an increase in revolving home equity, business loans and personal real estate loans, partly offset by decreases in business real estate and construction loans.  Business loans increased $34.8 million, or 0.6%, mainly due to a $68.0 million increase in commercial and industrial loans and a $23.1 million increase in tax-advantaged lending, partly offset by a $73.9 million decrease in commercial card loans.  Lease loans, included within business loans, also increased during 2024. Construction loans decreased $36.9 million, or 2.5%, mainly due to a decline in commercial construction lending.  Business real estate loans decreased $58.1 million, or 1.6%, due mainly to decreases in industrial and retail lending, while owner-occupied, multi-family and hotel lending grew.  Personal real estate loans increased $32.2 million, or 1.1%.  The Company sells certain long-term fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market, and loan sales in 2024 totaled $70.0 million, compared to $29.9 million in 2023.  Consumer loans decreased $4.6 million, or .2%, mainly due to a decline in consumer auto lending.  Fixed rate home equity and other vehicle and equipment loans also decreased combined with continued run off of marine and recreational vehicle loan balances, offset by growth in private banking and health services financing.  Consumer credit card loans increased $6.0 million, or 1.0%, and revolving home equity loan balances increased $36.8 million, or 11.5%, compared to balances at year end 2023.
The Company currently holds approximately 31% of its loan portfolio in the Kansas City market, 25% in the St. Louis market, and 44% in other regional markets. The portfolio is diversified from a business and retail standpoint, with 65% in loans to businesses and 35% in loans to consumers. The Company believes a diversified approach to loan portfolio management, strong underwriting criteria and an aversion toward credit concentrations from an industry, geographic and product perspective, have contributed to low levels of problem loans and credit losses on loans experienced over the last several years.
The Company participates in credits of large, publicly traded companies which are defined by regulation as shared national credits, or SNCs. Regulations define SNCs as loans exceeding $100 million that are shared by three or more financial institutions. The Company typically participates in these loans when business operations are maintained in the local communities or regional markets and opportunities to provide other banking services are present. At December 31, 2024, the balance of SNC loans totaled approximately $1.6 billion, with an additional $2.5 billion in unfunded commitments, compared to a balance of $1.5 billion, with an additional $2.2 billion in unfunded commitments, at year end 2023.
Commercial Loans
Business
Total business loans amounted to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and includes loans used mainly to fund customer accounts receivable, inventories, and capital expenditures. The business loan portfolio includes tax-advantaged loans and leases which carry tax-free interest rates.  These loans totaled $689.2 million at December 31, 2024, an increase of $23.1 million, or 3.5%, from December 31, 2023 balances. In addition to tax-advantaged leases, the business loan portfolio also includes other direct financing and sales type leases totaling $727.4 million at December 31, 2024, an increase of $17.6 million, or 2.5%, from December 31, 2023.  These loans are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to office and transportation equipment.  Additionally, the Company has $330.5 million of outstanding loans included within its $338.0 million oil and gas energy-related loan portfolio at December 31, 2024, which is further discussed within the Oil and Gas Energy Lending section of the Risk Elements of Loan Portfolio section located within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Also included in the business portfolio are corporate card 
35
Table of Contents
loans, which totaled $332.1 million at December 31, 2024 and are made in conjunction with the Company’s corporate card business for corporate trade purchases.  Corporate card loans are made to corporate, non-profit and government customers nationwide, but have very short-term maturities, which limits credit risk.
Business loans, excluding corporate card loans, are made primarily to customers in the regional trade area of the Company, generally the central Midwest, encompassing the states of Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, and nearby Midwestern markets, including Iowa, Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. This portfolio is diversified from an industry standpoint and includes businesses engaged in manufacturing, wholesaling, retailing, agribusiness, insurance, financial services, public utilities, health care, and other service businesses. Emphasis is upon middle-market and community businesses with known local management and financial stability.  Consistent with management’s strategy and emphasis upon relationship banking, most borrowing customers also maintain deposit accounts and utilize other banking services. Net loan charge-offs in this category totaled $1.1 million in 2024 compared to $3.1 million in 2023.  Non-accrual business loans were $101 thousand (less than .1% of business loans) at December 31, 2024 compared to $3.6 million at December 31, 2023.  
Real Estate-Construction and Land
The portfolio of loans in this category amounted to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $36.9 million, or 2.5%, from the prior year and comprised 8.2% of the Company’s total loan portfolio.  Commercial construction and land development loans totaled $1.2 billion, or 87.8% of total construction loans at December 31, 2024.  These loans decreased $36.0 million from 2023 year end balances, driving the decline in the total construction portfolio. Commercial construction loans are made during the construction phase for small and medium-sized office and medical buildings, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, apartment complexes, shopping centers, hotels and motels, and other commercial properties. Commercial land development loans relate to land owned or developed for use in conjunction with business properties. Residential construction and land development loans at December 31, 2024 totaled $172.2 million, or 12.2% of total construction loans. A stable construction market has contributed to low loss rates on these loans, with no net loan charge-offs and net loan recoveries of $115 thousand in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  
Real Estate-Business
Total business real estate loans were $3.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and comprised 21.3% of the Company’s total loan portfolio. This category includes mortgage loans for small and medium-sized office and medical buildings, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, distribution facilities, multi-family housing, farms, shopping centers, hotels and motels, churches, and other commercial properties.  The business real estate borrowers and/or properties are generally located in local and regional markets where Commerce does business, and emphasis is placed on owner-occupied lending (33.8% of this portfolio), which presents lower risk levels.  Additional information about business real estate loans by borrower is disclosed within the Real Estate - Business Loans section of the Risk Elements of Loan Portfolio section located within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  At December 31, 2024, balances of non-accrual loans amounted to $15.0 million, or .4% of business real estate loans, up from $60 thousand at year end 2023.  The Company experienced net loan recoveries of $106 thousand in 2024, compared to net loan charge-offs of $104 thousand in 2023.
Personal Banking Loans
Real Estate-Personal
At December 31, 2024, there were $3.1 billion in outstanding personal real estate loans, which comprised 17.8% of the Company’s total loan portfolio. The mortgage loans in this category are mainly for owner-occupied residential properties. The Company originates both adjustable and fixed rate mortgage loans, and at December 31, 2024, 44% of the portfolio was comprised of adjustable rate loans, while 56% was comprised of fixed rate loans.  The Company does not purchase any loans from outside parties or brokers. 
The Company originates certain mortgage loans with the intent to sell to the secondary market, generally FNMA or FHLMC conforming fixed rate loans.  The remaining loans are originated with the intent to hold to maturity.  Of the $453.0 million of mortgage loans originated in 2024, $70.0 million were sold to the secondary market.  This compares to $510.0 million of mortgage loans originated and $29.9 million of loans sold to the secondary market in 2023.  The increase in loan sales during 2024 compared to 2023 was mainly due to a shift in demand for fixed rate mortgage loans.  Net loan charge-offs in 2024 totaled $239 thousand, and net loan recoveries were $37 thousand in 2023.  Balances of non-accrual loans in this category were $1.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $1.7 million at year end 2023.

Consumer
Consumer loans consist of private banking, automobile, motorcycle, marine, tractor/trailer, recreational vehicle (RV), fixed rate home equity, patient health care financing and other types of consumer loans.  These loans totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2024.  Approximately 38% of the consumer portfolio consists of automobile loans, 35% in private banking loans, 11% in fixed rate home equity loans, and 11% in healthcare financing loans.  Total consumer loans decreased $4.6 million at year end 2024 compared to year end 2023.  A decline of $43.5 million in auto loans was supplemented by decreases of $13.6 million and $12.7 million in fixed rate home equity and other vehicle and equipment loans, respectively.  These decreases in consumer loan balances were partially offset by growth of $63.0 million in private banking loans and $11.9 million in patient healthcare financing.  Net charge-offs on total consumer loans were $9.8 million in 2024, compared to $6.2 million in 2023, averaging .46% and .30% of consumer loans in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Revolving Home Equity
Revolving home equity loans, of which 100% are adjustable rate loans, totaled $356.7 million at year end 2024.  An additional $947.9 million was available in unused lines of credit, which can be drawn at the discretion of the borrower. Home equity loans are secured mainly by second mortgages (and less frequently, first mortgages) on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity line product permit borrowing availability, in the aggregate, generally up to 80% or 90% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination.  Net loan recoveries were $166 thousand in 2024, compared to net loan recoveries of $57 thousand in 2023.
Consumer Credit Card
Total consumer credit card loans amounted to $595.9 million at December 31, 2024 and comprised 3.5% of the Company’s total loan portfolio. The credit card portfolio is concentrated within regional markets served by the Company. The Company offers a variety of credit card products, including affinity cards, rewards cards, and standard and premium credit cards, and emphasizes its credit card relationship product, Special Connections.  Approximately 36% of the households that own a Commerce credit card product also maintain a deposit relationship with the subsidiary bank.  Approximately 95% of the outstanding credit card loan balances had a floating interest rate at year end 2024, unchanged from year end 2023.  Net charge-offs amounted to $26.0 million in 2024, an increase of $6.9 million from $19.1 million in 2023.
Loans Held for Sale
At December 31, 2024, loans held for sale were mainly comprised of certain long-term fixed rate personal real estate loans.  The personal real estate loans are carried at fair value and totaled $3.0 million at December 31, 2024.  This portfolio is further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Liability for Unfunded Lending Commitments
To determine the amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments, the Company has established a process which assesses the risks and losses expected in its portfolios.  This process provides an allowance based on estimates of allowances for pools of loans and unfunded lending commitments, as well as a second, smaller component based on certain individually evaluated loans and unfunded lending commitments.  The Company's policies and processes for determining the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and in the "
Allowance for Credit Losses
" discussion within 
Critical Accounting Policies
 above.
Loans subject to individual evaluation generally consist of business, construction, business real estate and personal real estate loans on non-accrual status.  These non-accrual loans are evaluated individually for impairment based on factors such as payment history, borrower financial condition and collateral.  For collateral dependent loans, appraisals of collateral (including exit costs) are normally obtained annually but discounted based on the date last received and market conditions.  From these evaluations of expected cash flows and collateral values, specific allowances are determined.
Loans which are not individually evaluated are segregated by loan type and sub-type and are collectively evaluated.  These loans consist of commercial loans (business, construction and business real estate) which have been graded pass, special mention, or substandard, and also include all personal banking loans except personal real estate loans on non-accrual status. 
The allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments are estimates that require significant judgment including projections of the macro-economic environment.  The Company utilizes a third-party macro-economic forecast that continuously changes due to economic conditions and events.  These changes in the forecast cause fluctuations in the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments.  The Company uses judgment to assess the macro-economic forecast and internal loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments.  These estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes in the underlying external and internal data. 
At December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $162.7 million, compared to $162.4 million at December 31, 2023.  The allowance for credit losses related to commercial loans decreased $1.4 million during 2024, due to a decrease in loan balances and the impact of a continued positive economic forecast.  Offsetting this decrease in the allowance for credit losses on commercial loans was a $1.8 million increase in the allowance for credit losses related to personal banking loans.  The allowance for credit losses on personal banking loans increased over the December 31, 2023 allowance due to recent increased loan net charge-offs and past due trends in the credit card and auto portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the prepayment speeds of personal real estate loans.  The percentage of allowance to loans increased to .95% at December 31, 2024, compared to .94% at December 31, 2023.  See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the various model assumptions utilized in the Company's CECL estimate at December 31, 2024.
Net loan charge-offs totaled $38.9 million in 2024, representing a $7.8 million increase compared to net charge-offs of $31.1 million in 2023.  The increase was largely due to higher net charge-offs of $7.0 million and $3.5 million on consumer credit card loans and consumer loans, respectively, during 2024, and partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in net charge-offs on business loans in 2024 compared to 2023. Consumer credit card loan net charge-offs were 4.64% of average consumer credit card loans in 2024, compared to 3.40% in 2023, and consumer loan net charge-offs were .46% of average consumer loans in 2024, compared to .30% in 2023.  The ratio of net loan charge-offs to total average loans outstanding was .23% in 2024 and .19% in 2023. 
Total loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing were $24.5 million at December 31, 2024, an increase of $2.7 million compared to year end 2023.  Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2024 were $18.3 million, an increase of $11.0 million from the prior year, mainly due to an increase in business real estate non-accrual loans of $15.0 million, partly offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in business non-accrual loans. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-accrual loans was 890.4% at December 31, 2024, compared to 2,220.9% at December 31, 2023.  The decrease in the ratio of the allowance to non-accrual loans was driven by the increase in non-accrual loans outstanding.  The 2024 year-end balance of non-accrual loans was comprised of $101 thousand of business loans, $220 thousand of construction real estate loans, $1.0 million of personal real estate loans, $2.0 million of revolving home equity loans, and $15.0 million of business real estate loans.  
At December 31, 2024, the liability for unfunded lending commitments was $18.9 million, a decrease of $6.3 million compared to December 31, 2023.  The decrease in the liability for unfunded lending commitments during 2024 was driven primarily by decreases in the balance of unfunded lending commitments.  The Company's unfunded lending commitments primarily relate to construction loans, and the Company's estimate for credit losses in its unfunded lending commitments

Table of Contents
utilizes the same model and forecast as its estimate for credit losses on loans.  See Note 2 for further discussion of the model inputs utilized in the Company's estimate of credit losses.
The Company considers the allowance for credit losses on loans and the liability for unfunded lending commitments adequate to cover losses expected in the loan portfolio, including unfunded commitments, at December 31, 2024.

Risk Elements of the Loan Portfolio  
Management reviews the loan portfolio continuously for evidence of problem loans. During the ordinary course of business, management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of loan agreements. Such loans are placed under close supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non-accrual status, the need for an additional allowance for credit loss, and (if appropriate) partial or full loan charge-off. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management does not expect to collect payments consistent with acceptable and agreed upon terms of repayment. After a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income.  Interest is included in income only as received and only after all previous loan charge-offs have been recovered, so long as management is satisfied there is no impairment of collateral values. The loan is returned to accrual status only when the borrower has brought all past due principal and interest payments current, and, in the opinion of management, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled. Loans that are 90 days past due as to principal and/or interest payments are generally placed on non-accrual, unless they are both well-secured and in the process of collection, or they are comprised of those personal banking loans that are exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as non-accrual. Consumer installment loans and related accrued interest are normally charged down to the fair value of related collateral (or are charged off in full if no collateral) once the loans are more than 120 days delinquent. Credit card loans and the related accrued interest are charged off when the receivable is more than 180 days past due. 
The following schedule shows non-performing assets and loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest.

Non-accrual loans totaled $18.3 million at year end 2024, an increase of $11.0 million from the balance at year end 2023. The increase from December 31, 2023 occurred mainly in business real estate, which increased $14.9 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in business loans of $3.5 million.  At December 31, 2024, non-accrual loans were comprised of business real estate (81.8%), revolving home equity (10.8%), personal real estate (5.6%), construction and land real estate (1.2%), and business (0.6%) loans.  Foreclosed real estate totaled $343 thousand at December 31, 2024, an increase of $73 thousand when compared to December 31, 2023.  Total non-performing assets remain low compared to the overall banking industry in 2024, with the non-performing assets to total loans ratio at .11% at December 31, 2024.  Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $24.5 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $2.7 million when compared to December 31, 2023.  Balances by class for non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest are shown in the 
"Delinquent and non-accrual loans"
 section of Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the non-performing and past due loans mentioned above, the Company also has identified loans for which management has concerns about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms.  They are classified as substandard under the Company’s internal rating system.  The loans are generally secured by either real estate or other borrower assets, reducing the potential for loss should they become non-performing.  Although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans, they may never become non-performing.  Such loans totaled $330.3 million at December 31, 2024, compared with $216.4 million at December 31, 2023, resulting in an increase of $113.9 million or 52.7%.  The increase in potential problem loans was largely driven by a $56.8 million increase in business loans and a $55.2 million increase in business real estate loans.

Loans with Special Risk Characteristics
Management relies primarily on an internal risk rating system, in addition to delinquency status, to assess risk in the loan portfolio, and these statistics are presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  However, certain types of loans are considered at a higher risk of loss due to their terms, location, or special conditions.  Construction and land loans and business real estate loans are subject to higher risk because of the impact that volatile interest rates and a changing economy can have on real estate value, and because of the potential volatility of the real estate industry. Certain home equity loans have contractual features that could increase credit exposure in a market of declining real estate prices, when interest rates are steadily increasing, or when a geographic area experiences an economic downturn. For these home equity loans, higher risks could exist when 1) loan terms require a minimum monthly payment that covers only interest, or 2) loan-to-collateral value (LTV) ratios at origination are above 80%, with no private mortgage insurance.  Information presented below for home equity loans is based on LTV ratios which were calculated with valuations at loan origination date.  The Company does not obtain updated appraisals or valuations unless the loans become significantly delinquent or are in the process of being foreclosed upon.  In addition, FICO scores are obtained and updated on a quarterly basis for most of the loans in the Personal Banking portfolio.  This is a published credit score designed to measure the risk of default by taking into account various factors from a borrower's financial history and is considered supplementary information utilized by the Company, as management does not consider this information in evaluating the allowance for credit losses on loans.  The Bank normally obtains a FICO score at the loan's origination and renewal dates, and updates are obtained on a quarterly basis.  For credit monitoring purposes, the Company analyzes delinquency information, current FICO scores, and line utilization.  This has remained an effective means of evaluating credit trends and identifying problem loans, partly because the Company offers standard, conservative lending products.
Real Estate - Construction and Land Loans
The Company’s portfolio of construction and land loans, as shown in the table below, amounted to 8.2% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2024.  The largest component of construction and land loans was commercial construction, which decreased $25.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, multi-family residential construction loans totaled approximately $526.6 million, or 44.0%, of the commercial construction loan portfolio.

Real Estate – Business Loans
Total business real estate loans were $3.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and comprised 21.3% of the Company’s total loan portfolio. These loans include properties such as manufacturing and warehouse buildings, distribution facilities, small office and medical buildings, churches, hotels and motels, shopping centers, and other commercial properties, which have historically resulted in lower net charge-off rates than non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Approximately 33.8% of these loans were for owner-occupied real estate properties, which have historically resulted in lower net charge-off rates than non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans.

Revolving Home Equity Loans
The Company has revolving home equity loans that are generally collateralized by residential real estate. Most of these loans (93.5%) are written with terms requiring interest-only monthly payments. These loans are offered in three main product lines: LTV up to 80%, 80% to 90%, and 90% to 100%.  As shown in the following tables, the percentage of loans with LTV ratios greater than 80% has remained a small segment of this portfolio, and delinquencies have been low and stable.  The weighted average FICO score for the total portfolio balance at December 31, 2024 was 776.  At maturity, the accounts are re-underwritten and if they qualify under the Company's credit, collateral and capacity policies, the borrower is given the option to renew the line of credit or to convert the outstanding balance to an amortizing loan.  If criteria are not met, amortization is required, or the borrower may pay off the loan.  Over the next three years, approximately 14.3% of the Company's current outstanding balances are expected to mature.  Of these balances, 85.7% have a FICO score above 700.  The Company does not expect a significant increase in losses as these loans mature, due to their high FICO scores, low LTVs, and low historical loss levels.

Investment Securities Analysis
Investment securities are comprised of securities that are classified as available for sale, equity, trading or other. The largest component, available for sale debt securities, decreased 7.1% during 2024 to $10.1 billion (excluding unrealized gains/losses in fair value) at year end 2024.  During 2024, available for sale debt securities of $2.6 billion were purchased, which included $2.2 billion in U.S. government and federal agency obligations and $395.0 million in asset-backed securities.  Total sales, maturities and pay downs of available for sale debt securities were $3.4 billion during 2024.  During 2025, maturities and pay downs of approximately $
1.6 
billion are expected to occur.  The Company's tax-exempt investment portfolio is included in its state and municipal obligations and represented 39% of this portfolio at December 31, 2024, compared to 30% at December 31, 2023.  The decline in balances of tax-exempt investment securities during 2024 was mostly due to sales of securities as part of the Company's available for sale debt securities portfolio repositioning discussed in Note 3, Investment Securities.
At December 31, 2024, the fair value of available for sale securities was $9.1 billion, which included a net unrealized loss in fair value of $990.6 million, compared to a net unrealized loss of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023.

Equity securities mainly include common and preferred stock with readily determinable fair values that totaled $48.4 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $5.7 million at December 31, 2023.
Other securities totaled $230.1 million at December 31, 2024 and $222.5 million at December 31, 2023.  These include Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank (Des Moines) stock held by the bank subsidiary in accordance with debt and regulatory requirements. These are restricted securities and are carried at cost.  Also included in other securities are private equity investments which are held by a subsidiary qualified as a Small Business Investment Company.  These investments are carried at estimated fair value, but are not readily marketable.  While the nature of these investments carries a higher degree of risk than the normal lending portfolio, this risk is mitigated by the overall size of the investments and oversight provided by management, and management believes the potential for long-term gains in these investments outweighs the potential risks.

Average deposits decreased $801.4 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly resulting from decreases of $884.5 million, $152.8 million and $110.8 million in business demand deposits, savings account balances and money market account balances, respectively.  Partly offsetting these decreases was an increase in interest checking account balances of $328.6 million.

Total balances of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2024 were $2.9 billion, comprised of federal funds purchased of $123.7 million and repurchase agreements of $2.8 billion.

 The Company's available for sale debt securities portfolio has a diverse mix of high quality and liquid investment securities with a duration of 4.0 years at December 31, 2024.  Approximately $1.6 billion of the available for sale debt portfolio is expected to mature or pay down during 2025, and these funds offer substantial resources to meet either new loan demand or offset potential reductions in the Company’s deposit funding base.  The Company pledges portions of its investment securities portfolio to secure public fund deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, trust funds, letters of credit issued by the FHLB, and borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, total investment securities pledged for these purposes were as follows:

The average loans to deposits ratio is a measure of a bank's liquidity, and the Company’s average loans to deposits ratio was 69.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Core customer deposits, defined as non-interest bearing, interest checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts, totaled $22.9 billion and represented 90.6% of the Company’s total deposits at December 31, 2024.  These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company promoting long lasting relationships and stable funding sources.  Core deposits increased $417.0 million at year end 2024 compared to year end 2023, primarily due to an increase in commercial deposits of $605.6 million, partly offset by decreases in wealth management deposits and consumer deposits of $111.8 million and $68.7 million, respectively.  While the Company considers core consumer and wealth management deposits less volatile, corporate deposits could decline if interest rates increase significantly, encouraging corporate customers to increase investing activities, or if the economy deteriorates and companies experience lower cash inflows, reducing deposit balances.  If these corporate deposits decline, the Company's funding needs may be met by liquidity supplied by investment security maturities and pay downs expected to total $1.6 billion over the next year, as noted above.  In addition, as shown in the table of collateral available for future advances below, the Company has borrowing capacity of $6.1 billion through advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve.

Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or greater totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024. These deposits are normally considered more volatile and higher costing, and comprised 5.5% of total deposits at December 31, 2024.
Amid the banking sector's period of uncertainty during the second quarter of 2023, the Company issued several tranches of short-term brokered certificates of deposit totaling $1.2 billion, which all matured by December 31, 2023.  During the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued $100.0 million of brokered certificates, all of which matured by December 31, 2024.  The Company may occasionally issue brokered certificates of deposit to test the reliability of this potential funding source.  While it is not clear how many brokered certificates of deposit the market would allow the Company to issue, the Company believes brokered certificates of deposits may be an additional, reliable source of liquidity during periods of stress in the banking industry.

Federal funds purchased, which totaled $123.7 million at December 31, 2024, are unsecured overnight borrowings obtained mainly from upstream correspondent banks with which the Company maintains approved lines of credit.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had approved lines of credit totaling $3.9 billion.  Since these borrowings are unsecured and limited by market trading activity, their availability may be less certain than collateralized sources of borrowings.  Retail repurchase agreements are offered to customers wishing to earn interest in highly liquid balances and are used by the Company as a funding source considered to be stable, but short-term in nature.  Repurchase agreements are collateralized by securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.  Total repurchase agreements at December 31, 2024 were comprised of non-insured customer funds totaling $2.8 billion, and securities pledged as collateral for these retail agreements totaled $2.9 billion. 
The Company pledges certain assets, including loans and investment securities, to both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB as security to establish lines of credit and borrow from these entities.  Based on the amount and type of collateral pledged, the FHLB establishes a collateral value from which the Company may draw advances against the collateral.  Additionally, this collateral is used to enable the FHLB to issue letters of credit in favor of public fund depositors of the Company.  The Federal Reserve Bank also establishes a collateral value of assets pledged and permits borrowings from the discount window.  The following table reflects the collateral value of assets pledged, borrowings, and letters of credit outstanding, in addition to the estimated future funding capacity available to the Company at December 31, 2024.

The Company considers these ratings to be indications of a sound capital base and strong liquidity and believes that these ratings would help ensure the ready marketability of its commercial paper, should the need arise. No commercial paper has been outstanding during the past ten years.  The Company has no subordinated or hybrid debt instruments which would affect future borrowing capacity.  Because of its lack of significant long-term debt, the Company believes that, through its Capital Markets Group or in other public debt markets, it could generate additional liquidity from sources such as jumbo certificates of deposit, privately-placed corporate notes or other forms of debt.

The cash flows from the operating, investing and financing activities of the Company resulted in a net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $688.7 million in 2024, as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Operating activities, consisting mainly of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, provided cash flow of $577.9 million and has historically been a stable source of funds. Investing activities provided cash of $483.8 million. Sales and maturities proceeds (net of purchases) of investment securities provided cash of $750.7 million, repayments of securities purchased under agreements to resell (net of securities purchased under agreements to resell) used cash of $175.0 million, and a net increase in the loan portfolio used cash of $54.7 million.  Investing activities are somewhat unique to financial institutions in that, while large sums of cash flow are normally used to fund growth in investment securities, loans, or other bank assets, they are normally dependent on the financing activities described below.
During 2024, financing activities used cash of $372.9 million.  This decrease in cash was largely driven treasury stock purchases, which used cash of $170.5 million. The Company paid cash dividends of $139.5 million on common stock, and a decline in deposits used cash of $74.0 million during 2024. Federal funds purchases and short-term securities sold under agreements to repurchase provided cash of $17.9 million. Future short-term liquidity needs for daily operations are not expected to vary significantly, and the Company believes it maintains adequate liquidity to meet these cash flows. 
Cash outflows resulting from the Company’s transactions in its common stock were as follows:

These sources of funds are used mainly to pay cash dividends on outstanding stock, pay general operating expenses, and purchase treasury stock.  At December 31, 2024, the Parent’s investment securities totaled $18.1 million at fair value, consisting mainly of corporate bonds and preferred stock.  To support its various funding commitments, the Parent maintains a $20.0 million line of credit with its subsidiary bank.  There were no borrowings outstanding under the line during 2024 or 2023.  
Company senior management is responsible for measuring and monitoring the liquidity profile of the organization with oversight by the Company’s Asset/Liability Committee. This is done through a series of controls, including a written Contingency Funding Policy and risk monitoring procedures, which include daily, weekly and monthly reporting. In addition, the Company prepares forecasts to project changes in the balance sheet affecting liquidity and to allow the Company to better plan for forecasted changes.
Material Cash Requirements, Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company's material cash requirements include commitments for contractual obligations (both short-term and long-term), commitments to extend credit, and off-balance sheet arrangements.  The Company's material cash requirements for the next 12 months are primarily to fund loan growth.  Additionally, the Company will utilize cash to fund deposit maturities and withdrawals that may occur in the next 12 months.  Other contractual obligations, purchase commitments, lease obligations, and unfunded commitments may require cash payments by the Company within the next 12 months, and these, along with longer-term obligations, are discussed below.

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities arise that are not required to be recorded on the balance sheet.  The most significant of these are loan commitments totaling $15.4 billion (including approximately $5.8 billion in unused, approved credit card lines) and the contractual amount of standby letters of credit totaling $561.5 million at December 31, 2024.  As many commitments expire unused or only partially used, these totals do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Management does not anticipate any material losses arising from commitments or contingent liabilities and believes there are no material commitments to extend credit that represent risks of an unusual nature.
The Company funds a defined benefit pension plan for a portion of its employees.  Under the funding policy for the plan, contributions are made as necessary to provide for current service and for any unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities over a reasonable period.  No contributions to the defined benefit plan were made in 2024, 2023 or 2022, and the Company is not required nor does it expect to make a contribution in 2025.
The Company has investments in low-income housing partnerships generally within the areas it serves.  These partnerships supply funds for the construction and operation of apartment complexes that provide affordable housing to that segment of the population with lower family income. If these developments successfully attract a specified percentage of residents falling in that lower income range, federal (and sometimes state) income tax credits are made available to the partners. The tax credits are normally recognized over ten years, and they play an important part in the anticipated yield from these investments. In order to continue receiving the tax credits each year over the life of the partnership, the low-income residency targets must be maintained.

Under the terms of the partnership agreements, the Company has a commitment to fund a specified amount that will be due in installments over the life of the agreements, which ranges from 3 to 20 years.

At December 31, 2024, the investments totaled $94.4 million and are recorded as other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.  Unfunded commitments, which are recorded as liabilities, amounted to $56.9 million at December 31, 2024.
The Company regularly purchases various state tax credits arising from third-party property redevelopment.  These credits are either resold to third parties for a profit or retained for use by the Company.  During 2024, purchases and sales of tax credits amounted to $123.9 million and $127.6 million, respectively.  Income from the sales of tax credits were $5.2 million, $3.1 million and $5.4 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments totaling $215.3 million that it expects to fund in 2025.  These commitments, along with the commitments for the next five years, are included in the table above.  
Through the various sources of liquidity described above, the Company maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations.

The Company is subject to a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, which is an amount above the minimum ratios under capital adequacy guidelines, and is intended to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.  Failure to maintain the buffer will result in constraints on dividends, share repurchases, and executive compensation.
In the first quarter of 2020, the interim final rule of the Federal Reserve Bank and other U.S. banking agencies became effective, providing banks that adopted CECL (ASU 2016-13) during the 2020 calendar year the option to delay recognizing the estimated impact on regulatory capital until after a two year deferral period, followed by a three year transition period.  In connection with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company elected to utilize this option.  As a result, the two year deferral period for the Company extended through December 31, 2021.  Beginning on January 1, 2022, the Company was required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025.
The Company maintains a treasury stock buyback program under authorizations by its Board of Directors and periodically purchases stock in the open market.  During 2023, the Company purchased 1.4 million shares, and during 2024 the Company purchased 2.9 million shares. At December 31, 2024, 2.9 million shares remained available for purchase under the current Board authorization. 
The Company’s common stock dividend policy reflects its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels and alternative investment options.  Per share cash dividends paid by the Company increased 5.0% in 2024 compared with 2023, and the Company increased its first quarter 2025 cash dividend 7%, making 2025 the Company's 57th consecutive year of regular cash dividend increases. The Company also distributed its 31st consecutive annual 5% stock dividend in December 2024.

Interest Rate Sensitivity 
The Company’s Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO) measures and manages the Company’s interest rate risk on a monthly basis to identify trends and establish strategies to maintain stability in net interest income throughout various rate environments.  Analytical modeling techniques provide management insight into the Company’s exposure to changing rates. These techniques include net interest income simulations and market value analysis.  Management has set guidelines specifying acceptable limits within which net interest income and market value may change under various rate change scenarios.  
The Company’s main interest rate measurement tool, income simulation, projects net interest income under various rate change scenarios in order to quantify the magnitude and timing of potential rate-related changes.  Income simulations are able to capture option risks within the balance sheet where expected cash flows may be altered under various rate environments. Modeled rate movements include “shocks, ramps and twists.” Shocks are intended to capture interest rate risk under extreme conditions by immediately shifting rates up and down, while ramps measure the impact of gradual changes and twists measure yield curve risk.  The size of the balance sheet is assumed to remain constant so that results are not influenced by growth predictions. 
The Company also employs a sophisticated simulation technique known as a stochastic income simulation.  This technique allows management to see a range of results from hundreds of income simulations.  The stochastic simulation creates a vector of potential rate paths around the market’s best guess (forward rates) concerning the future path of interest rates and allows rates to randomly follow paths throughout the vector.  This allows for the modeling of non-biased rate forecasts around the market consensus.  Results give management insight into a likely range of rate-related risk as well as worst and best-case rate scenarios.
Additionally, the Company uses market value analyses to help identify longer-term risks that may reside on the balance sheet.  This is considered a secondary risk measurement tool by management.  The Company measures the market value of equity as the net present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted along the current swap curve plus appropriate market risk spreads.  It is the change in the market value of equity under different rate environments, or effective duration, that gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes.  Market value analyses also help management understand the price sensitivity of non-marketable bank products under different rate environments.
The tables below show the effects of gradual shifts in interest rates over a twelve month period on the Company’s net interest income versus the Company's net interest income in a flat rate scenario.  The simulation presents three rising rate scenarios and three falling rate scenarios and in each scenario, rates are assumed to change evenly over 12 months.  In these scenarios, the current balance sheet is held constant. 
The Company utilizes this simulation for monitoring interest rate risk.  While the future effects of rising and falling rates on deposit balances cannot be known, the Company maintains a practice of running multiple rate scenarios to better understand interest rate risk and its effect on the Company’s performance.

Under the simulation, in the three rising rate scenarios interest rate and three falling rate scenarios, interest rate risk is more asset sensitive when compared to the scenarios in the previous quarter.  This change is primarily due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest rates 50 basis points.  As short-term rates fall, deposit rates become less sensitive, which results in larger declines in net interest income in the falling rate scenarios.  This impact was slightly offset by an increase in deposits and by the benefit of interest rate floors, which result in progressively more interest income in the falling 200 and 300 basis points scenarios.  In the rising interest rate scenarios, deposits that are now less sensitive to rates result in larger increases in net interest income.  Deposit balances were held constant for this simulation in both the current and previous quarters.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that permits the use of derivative instruments to modify exposure to interest rate risk. Such instruments include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, credit risk participation agreements, mortgage loan commitments, forward sale contracts, and forward to-be-announced (TBA) contracts.  The Company’s interest rate risk management strategy includes the ability to modify the re-pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect the net interest margin and cash flows. 
In addition to using derivatives to manage interest rate risk, the Company enters into foreign exchange derivative instruments as an accommodation to customers and offsets the related foreign exchange risk by entering into offsetting third-party forward contracts with approved, reputable counterparties. This trading activity is managed within a policy of specific controls and limits. 
In all of these contracts, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties, who may be bank customers or other financial institutions. The Company controls the credit risk of its financial contracts through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Because the Company generally only enters into transactions with high quality counterparties, there have been no losses associated with counterparty nonperformance on derivative financial instruments.
The following table summarizes the notional amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Notional amount, along with the other terms of the derivative, is used to determine the amounts to be exchanged between the counterparties. Because the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties, it is not a measure of loss exposure related to the use of derivatives nor of exposure to liquidity risk.  All of these derivative instruments utilized by the Company are further discussed in Note 19 on Derivative Instruments in the consolidated financial statements.

Operating Segments
The Company segregates financial information for use in assessing its performance and allocating resources among three operating segments.  The results are determined based on the Company’s management accounting process, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each responsible segment.  These segments are defined by customer base and product type.  The management process measures the performance of the operating segments based on the management structure of the Company and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution.  Each segment is managed by executives who, in conjunction with the Chief Executive Officer, make strategic business decisions regarding that segment.  The three reportable operating segments are Consumer, Commercial, and Wealth.  Additional information is presented in Note 13 on Segments in the consolidated financial statements.
The Company uses a funds transfer pricing method to value funds used (e.g., loans, fixed assets, cash, etc.) and funds provided (deposits, borrowings, and equity) by the business segments and their components.  This process assigns a specific value to each new source or use of funds with a maturity, based on current swap rates, thus determining an interest spread at the time of the transaction.  Non-maturity assets and liabilities are valued using weighted average pools.  The funds transfer pricing process attempts to remove interest rate risk from valuation, allowing management to compare profitability under various rate environments.  The Company also assigns loan charge-offs and recoveries (labeled in the table below as “provision for credit

losses”) directly to each operating segment instead of allocating an estimated credit loss provision.  The operating segments also include a number of allocations of income and expense from various support and overhead centers within the Company.

Consumer
The Consumer segment includes consumer deposits, consumer finance, and consumer debit and credit cards.  During 2024, income before income taxes for the Consumer segment decreased $52.5 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2023.  This decrease was due to a decline in net interest income of $40.5 million, or 7.3%, an increase in the provision for credit losses of $10.2 million, or 37.0%, and higher non-interest expense of $4.9 million, or 1.5%, partly offset by an increase in non-interest income of $3.0 million, or 3.0%. Net interest income decreased due to an increase of $66.4 million in deposit interest expense, partly offset by a $19.7 million increase in loan interest income and a $6.2 million increase in net allocated funding credits assigned to the Consumer segment's loan and deposit portfolios.  
Non-interest income increased mainly due to growth in
 net bank card fees (mainly credit and debit card fees), deposit account fees and mortgage banking revenue
.
  Non-interest expense increased over the same period in the previous year mainly due to higher miscellaneous losses and allocated support costs for information technology and retail operations, partly offset by lower salaries and benefits expense and allocated management support costs.  The provision for credit losses totaled $37.6 million, a $10.2 million increase over the prior year, which resulted mainly from higher consumer credit card and auto loan net charge-offs, partly offset by lower other vehicle and equipment loan net charge-offs.  Total average loans in this segment decreased $1.7 million in 2024 compared to 2023 mainly due to declines in auto and

Table of Contents
other vehicle loans and personal real estate loans, partly offset by higher revolving and fixed rate home equity loans.  Average deposits increased $44.4 million, or .4%, over the prior year, resulting from growth in certificate of deposit account balances, partly offset by declines in savings, interest checking and money market deposit account balances.
During 2023, income before income taxes for the Consumer segment decreased $65.3 million, or 18.0%, compared to 2022.  This decrease was due to lower net interest income of $29.6 million, or 5.1%, higher non-interest expense of $20.2 million, or 6.6%, an increase in the provision for credit losses of $9.6 million, or 54.1%, and a decline in non-interest income of $5.9 million, or 5.6%.  Net interest income decreased due to a $17.4 million decrease in net allocated funding credits assigned to the Consumer segment's loan and deposit portfolios and an increase of $54.0 million in deposit interest expense, partly offset by a $41.8 million increase in loan interest income.  
Non-interest income decreased mainly due to lower deposit account fees (mainly overdraft and return item fees) and mortgage banking revenue, partly offset by growth in net debit card fees
.  Non-interest expense increased over 2022 mainly due to higher salaries and benefits expense, FDIC insurance expense, data processing and software expense and allocated support costs for consumer administration and operations and information technology.  The provision for credit losses totaled $27.5 million, a $9.6 million increase over 2022, which resulted mainly from higher consumer credit card and personal loan net charge-offs.  Total average loans in this segment increased $127.4 million, or 3.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022 mainly due to increases in personal real estate loans and revolving and fixed rate home equity loans.  Average deposits decreased $1.2 billion, or 8.8%, from 2022, resulting from declines in money market, interest checking and savings deposit account balances, partly offset by growth in certificate of deposit account balances.

Commercial
The Commercial segment provides lending (including the Small Business Banking product line within the branch network), leasing, international services, and business, government deposit, and related commercial cash management services, as well as merchant and commercial bank card products.  The segment includes the Commercial Tradable Products division, which sells fixed-income securities, underwrites municipal bonds, and provides securities safekeeping and accounting services to its business and correspondent bank customers.  Pre-tax income for 2024 decreased $254 thousand, or .1%, compared to 2023, mainly due to lower net interest income and higher non-interest expense, mostly offset by higher non-interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses.  Net interest income decreased $5.8 million, or 1.1%, due to lower net allocated funding credits of $30.9 million, coupled with higher interest expense on deposits and borrowings of $21.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively.  These decreases to income were partly offset by higher loan interest income of $53.1 million.  Non-interest income increased $13.0 million, or 5.3%, over the previous year mainly due to growth in deposit account fees (mainly corporate cash management fees), capital market fees, tax credit sales fees and loan commitment fees.  These increases were partly offset by decreases in net bank card fees (mainly corporate card fees), letter of credit fees and swap fees.

 Non-interest expense increased $9.5 million, or 2.4%, mainly due to higher salaries and benefits expense and allocated servicing and support costs for management and bank operations.  These increases were partly offset by lower insurance and marketing expense.  The provision for credit losses decreased $2.1 million from the same period last year, mainly due to lower commercial and industrial loan net charge-offs.  Average segment loans increased $240.8 million, or 2.2%, compared to 2023, mainly due to growth in business real estate, floor plan, tax free, and commercial and industrial loans.  Average deposits decreased $498.9 million, or 4.8%, mainly due to declines in business demand and certificate of deposit account balances, partly offset by increases in interest checking and money market account balances.
Pre-tax income for 2023 decreased $29.3 million, or 7.3%, compared to 2022, mainly due to a decrease in net interest income and increases in non-interest expense and the provision for credit losses, partly offset by an increase in non-interest income.  Net interest income decreased $21.4 million, or 3.9%, due to a decrease of $129.3 million in net allocated funding credits assigned to the Commercial segment's loan and deposit portfolios and increases in interest expense on customer repurchase agreements and deposits of $49.4 million and $116.4 million, respectively.  These decreases to income were partly offset by higher loan interest income of $273.0 million.  Non-interest income increased $21.4 million, or 9.5%, over 2022 due to growth in net bank card fees (mainly corporate card and merchant fees), deposit account fees (mainly corporate cash management fees), letter of credit fees and cash sweep commissions, partly offset by a decline in tax credit sales
 fees. 
 Non-interest expense increased $26.9 million, or 7.4%, mainly due to higher salaries and benefits expense, FDIC insurance expense and allocated service and support costs (mainly bank operations, commercial payments and products and credit administration).  These increases were partly offset by lower allocated support costs for information technology.  The provision for credit losses increased $2.3 million over 2022, mainly due to higher business loan net charge-offs.  Average segment loans increased $1.0 billion, or 10.4%, compared to 2022, mainly due to increases in business, business real estate, and construction loans.  Average deposits decreased $1.6 billion, or 13.1%, mainly due to declines in business demand and money market deposit account balances, partly offset by increases in interest checking and certificate of deposit account balances.

Wealth
The Wealth segment provides traditional trust and estate planning, advisory and discretionary investment management services, brokerage services, and includes Private Banking accounts.  At December 31, 2024, the Trust group managed investments with a market value of $45.3 billion and administered an additional $29.5 billion in non-managed assets.  It also provides investment management services to The Commerce Funds, a series of mutual funds with $2.6 billion in total assets at December 31, 2024.  In 2024, pre-tax income for the Wealth segment was $172.5 million, compared to $160.3 million in 2023, an increase of $12.2 million, or 7.6%.  Net interest income decreased $12.0 million, or 12.0%, mainly due to a $20.3 million increase in deposit interest expense and a $510 thousand decline in net allocated funding credits assigned to the Wealth segment's loan and deposit portfolios, partly offset by an $8.9 million increase in loan interest income.  Non-interest income increased $25.2 million, or 11.6%, over the prior year mainly due to higher private client and institutional trust fees, brokerage fees and cash sweep commissions.  Non-interest expense increased $1.3 million, or .8%, mainly due to higher salaries and benefits expense, partly offset by deconversion costs recorded in the prior year (previously mentioned).  The provision for credit losses decreased $176 thousand from the prior year due to lower fixed-rate home equity loan net charge-offs.  Average assets increased $72.3 million, or 3.8%, during 2024 mainly due to higher personal real estate loan balances, partly offset by lower commercial and industrial and fixed rate home equity loan balances.  Average deposits increased $1.6 million, or .1%, due to growth in certificate of deposit and money market deposit account balances, mostly offset by declines in interest checking and business demand deposit account balances.
In 2023, pre-tax income for the Wealth segment was $160.3 million, compared to $187.2 million in 2022, a decrease of $26.9 million, or 14.3%.  Net interest income decreased $18.9 million, or 15.9%, mainly due to a $25.0 million decrease in net allocated funding credits assigned to the Wealth segment's loan and deposit portfolios and a $26.2 million increase in deposit interest expense, partly offset by a $32.3 million increase in loan interest income.  Non-interest income decreased $2.9 million, or 1.3%, from 2022 mainly due to lower mutual fund retail trust fees and lower brokerage fees (mainly annuity fees), partly offset by higher private client trust fees and cash sweep commissions.  Non-interest expense increased $5.1 million, or 3.3%, mainly due to higher salaries and benefits expense and deconversion costs recorded in 2023, partly offset by lower allocated costs for trust service fees to affiliates.  The provision for credit losses increased $20 thousand over 2022.  Average assets increased $54.9 million, or 3.0%, during 2023 mainly due to higher personal real estate loan balances, partly offset by lower business and fixed rate home equity loan balances.  Average deposits decreased $427.4 million, or 15.2%, due to declines in interest checking and money market deposit account balances, partly offset by growth in certificate of deposit account balances.
The segment activity, as shown above, includes both direct and allocated items.  Amounts in the “Other/Elimination” column include the activity of various support and overhead operating units of the Company, in addition to the investment securities portfolio, brokered deposits and other items not allocated to the segments.  In accordance with the Company's transfer pricing procedures, the difference between the total provision and total net charge-offs/recoveries is not allocated to a business segment and is included in this category.  In 2024, the pre-tax net loss in this category was $110.7 million, compared to net losses of $211.1 million in 2023.  Unallocated securities gains were $7.8 million in 2024, compared to securities gains of $15.0 million in 2023.  Additionally, net interest income increased $100.4 million, the provision for credit losses decreased $10.5 million, and non-interest income increased $1.2 million. These increases were partly offset by an increase in non-interest expense of $4.6 million.  The increase in net interest income was driven by decreases in interest expense on borrowings and deposits of $52.1 million and $17.7 million, respectively, and a $25.2 million decrease in net allocated funding credits.  The decrease in the unallocated provision for credit losses was primarily driven by a decrease in the liability for unfunded lending commitments, partly offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, which are both not allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes.  Net charge-offs are allocated to segments when incurred for management reporting purposes.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments was a benefit $6.3 million, compared to a benefit of $7.9 million in 2023.  The provision for credit losses on loans was $347 thousand in excess of net-charge offs in 2024, due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans, while the provision was $12.3 million higher than net charge-offs in 2023.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
   Segment Reporting
  The FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures", in November 2023. The amendments require disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. Public entities are required to disclose significant expense categories and amounts for each reportable segment, as well as the amount and a description of the composition of other segment items.  Significant expense categories are derived from expenses that are regularly provided to an entity’s chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), and included in a segment’s reported measures of profit or loss.  Public entities are also required to disclose the title and position of the CODM and explain how the CODM uses the reported measures of profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. This Update requires interim disclosures of certain segment-related disclosures that previously were only required annually. This Update requires annual disclosures for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2024 and interim disclosures for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2025. The Company adopted this standard in 2024, and other than the inclusion of additional disclosures, the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The standard will be effective for the Company's consolidated financial statements for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025.
   Income Taxes  
The FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures", in December 2023. The amendments in this Update require additional disclosures regarding the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This Update also removed certain existing disclosure requirements.  This Update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied on a prospective basis, though retrospective application is permitted. Other than the inclusion of additional disclosures, the adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
   Income Statement Reporting  
The FASB issued ASU 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses" in November 2024.  The amendments in this Update require new disclosures providing further detail of a company's income statement expense items.  This Update is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2027, and interim periods beginning January 1, 2028. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied on a prospective basis.  Other than the inclusion of additional disclosures, the adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Corporate Governance
The Company has adopted a number of corporate governance measures. These include corporate governance guidelines, a code of ethics that applies to its senior financial officers and the charters for its audit and risk committee, its committee on compensation and human resources, and its committee on governance/directors.  This information is available on the Company’s investor relations website at

Item 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Commerce Bancshares, Inc.: 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Commerce Bancshares, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Assessment for credit losses related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment
As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the total allowance for credit losses was $162.7 million as of December 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is measured on a collective (pool) basis where loans are aggregated into pools based on similar risk characteristics. The Company estimates the collective ACL utilizing average historical loss rates, calculated using historical net charge-offs and outstanding loan balances during a lookback period for each pool. In certain pools, if the Company’s own historical loss rate is not reflective of loss

Table of Contents
expectations, the historical loss rate is augmented by industry and peer data. The calculated average net charge-off rate is then adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts (forecast adjust loss rate). These adjustments increase or decrease the average historical loss rate to reflect expectations of further losses given a single path economic forecast of key macroeconomic variables. The adjustments are based on results from various regression models projecting the impact of the macroeconomic variables to loss rates.  The forecast is used for a reasonable and supportable period before reverting back to historical averages using a straight-line method. The forecast adjustment loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of loans over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for expected prepayments. The allowance is further adjusted for certain qualitative factors not included in historical loss rates or the macroeconomic forecast, which include concentrations, changes in portfolio composition and characteristics, underwriting practices, watchlist trends, or significant unique events or conditions.
We identified the assessment of the December 31, 2024 collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgement was involved in the assessment due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, this assessment encompassed the evaluation of the conceptual soundness of the average historical loss model used to estimate the collective ACL, including the following key factors and assumptions (1) historical losses, (2) the reasonable and supportable forecast period, and (3) the development and evaluation of qualitative adjustments. In addition, auditor judgement was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s measurement of the collective ACL estimates, including controls over the (1) development and approval of the collective ACL methodology, (2) performance monitoring of the collective ACL methodology and model, (3) identification and determination of the key factors and assumptions used to estimate the collective ACL, (4) development of qualitative adjustments, and (5) analysis of the collective ACL results, trends, and ratios. We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ACL results by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. We evaluated whether the historical losses in the Company’s portfolio are representative of the credit characteristics of the current portfolio. We involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
•
evaluating the Company’s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S generally accepted accounting principles
•
evaluating the collective ACL methodology and model for conceptual soundness by inspecting the methodology and model documentation to determine whether the methodology and model are suitable for intended use
•
testing the historical losses period and the reasonable and supportable forecast period by comparing them to the Company’s business environment and relevant industry practices
•
evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the collective ACL compared with changes in the nature and volume of the entity’s loans and leases and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative model.
We assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the Company’s December 31, 2024 collective ACL by evaluating the cumulative results of the audit procedures, qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices and potential bias in the accounting estimates.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1971.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
Commerce Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) conducts its principal activities from approximately 
243
 branch and ATM locations throughout Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Oklahoma and Colorado. Principal activities include retail and commercial banking, investment management, securities brokerage, mortgage banking, trust, and private banking services.  The Company also maintains offices in Dallas, Houston, Cincinnati, Nashville, Des Moines, Indianapolis, and Grand Rapids that support customers in its commercial and/or wealth segments and operates a commercial payments business with sales representatives covering the continental U.S.
Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates, and Subsequent Events
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated through consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Such reclassifications had no effect on net income or total assets.
The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and reporting practices applicable to the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements under GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. These estimates are based on information available to management at the time the estimates are made.  While the consolidated financial statements reflect management’s best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Management has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition or disclosure through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.
The Company, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities that involve variable interest entities (VIEs).  A VIE is a legal entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments.  However, an enterprise is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  An enterprise that is the primary beneficiary must consolidate the VIE.  The Company’s interests in VIEs are evaluated to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. 
The Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary in a rabbi trust related to a deferred compensation plan offered to certain employees. The assets and liabilities of this trust, which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are not significant. The Company also has variable interests in certain entities in which it is not the primary beneficiary.  These entities are not consolidated.  These interests include certain investments in entities accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as well as affordable housing limited partnership interests, holdings in its investment portfolio of various asset and mortgage-backed bonds that are issued by securitization trusts, and managed discretionary trust assets that are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
In the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include “Cash and due from banks”, “Federal funds sold", "Securities purchased under agreements to resell”, and “Interest earning deposits with banks” as segregated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Restricted cash is comprised of cash collateral on deposit with another financial institution to secure interest rate swap transactions.  Restricted cash is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled $
82
 thousand and $
101
 thousand at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
During 2020, the Federal Reserve System, which historically required the Bank to maintain cash balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020.  Other interest earning cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $
2.6
 billion at December 31, 2024.

Loans and Related Earnings
The Company's portfolio of held-for-investment loans includes a net investment in direct financing and sales type leases to commercial and industrial and tax-exempt entities, and collectively, the Company's portfolio of loans and leases is referred to as its "loan portfolio" or "loans".  Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at amortized cost, excluding accrued interest receivable.  Amortized cost is the outstanding principal balance, net of any deferred fees and costs on originated loans.  Origination fee income received on loans and amounts representing the estimated direct costs of origination are deferred and amortized to interest income over the life of the loan using the interest method.  
Interest on loans is accrued based upon the principal amount outstanding.  The Company has elected the practical expedient to exclude all accrued interest receivable from all required disclosures of amortized cost.  Additionally, an election was made not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables.  The Company has also made the election that all interest accrued but ultimately not received is reversed against interest income.  
Loan and commitment fees, net of costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income over the term of the loan or commitment as an adjustment of yield.  Annual fees charged on credit card loans are capitalized to principal and amortized over 
12
 months to loan fees and sales.  Other credit card fees, such as cash advance fees and late payment fees, are recognized in income as an adjustment of yield when charged to the cardholder’s account.
Past Due Loans
Management reports loans as past due on the day following the contractual repayment date if payment was not received by end of the business day.  Loans, or portions of loans, are charged off to the extent deemed uncollectible.  Loan charge-offs reduce the allowance for credit losses on loans, and recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance.  Business, business real estate, construction and land real estate, and personal real estate loans are generally charged down to estimated collectible balances when they are placed on non-accrual status.  Consumer loans and related accrued interest are normally charged down to the fair value of related collateral (or are charged off in full if not collateralized) once the loans are more than 
120
 to 
180
 days delinquent, depending on the type of loan.  Revolving home equity loans are charged down to the fair value of the related collateral once the loans are more than 
180
 days past due.  Credit card loans are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when the receivable is more than 
180
 days past due.

Non-Accrual Loans
Loans are placed on non-accrual status when management does not expect to collect payments consistent with acceptable and agreed upon terms of repayment. Business, construction real estate, business real estate, and individually significant personal real estate and consumer loans that are contractually 
90
 days past due as to principal and/or interest payments are generally placed on non-accrual status, unless they are both well-secured and in the process of collection.  Personal real estate, consumer, revolving home equity and credit card loans are generally exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as non-accrual.  When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest income, and the loan is charged off to the extent uncollectible.  Principal and interest payments received on non-accrual loans are generally applied to principal.

Interest is included in income only after all previous loan charge-offs have been recovered and is recorded only as received. The loan is returned to accrual status only when the borrower has brought all past due principal and interest payments current, and, in the opinion of management, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled.  A six month history of sustained payment performance is generally required before reinstatement of accrual status.
Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
The Company may renegotiate the terms of existing loans for a variety of reasons. When refinancing or restructuring a loan, the Company evaluates whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In making this determination, the Company considers whether the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt. In addition, the Company evaluates whether it is probable that the borrower would be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification and if the borrower (without the current modification) could obtain equivalent financing from another creditor at a market rate for similar debt. Modifications of loans to borrowers in these situations may indicate that the borrower is facing financial difficulty.

Loans Held For Sale
Historically, loans held for sale included student loans and certain fixed rate residential mortgage loans.  These loans are typically classified as held for sale upon origination based upon management's intent to sell the production of these loans.  During 2024, the Company sold its remaining portfolio of student loans.  When offered, the student loans were carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value, and their fair value was determined based on sale contract prices.  The mortgage loans are carried at fair value under the elected fair value option.  Their fair value is based on secondary market prices for loans with similar characteristics, including an adjustment for embedded servicing value.  Changes in fair value and gains and losses on sales are included in loan fees and sales.  Deferred fees and costs related to these loans are not amortized but are recognized as part of the cost basis of the loan at the time it is sold. Interest income related to loans held for sale is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and the loan's contractual interest rate.
Occasionally, other types of loans may be classified as held for sale in order to manage credit concentration.  These loans are carried at the lower of cost or fair value with gains and losses on sales recognized in loan fees and sales.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
The allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation amount that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans not held at fair value to present the net amount expected to be collected over the contractual term of the loans.  The allowance for credit losses on loans is measured using relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss experience on loans with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the loans.  An allowance will be created upon origination or acquisition of a loan and is updated at subsequent reporting dates.  The methodology is applied consistently for each reporting period and reflects management’s current expectations of credit losses.  Changes to the allowance for credit losses on loans resulting from periodic evaluations are recorded through increases or decreases to the credit loss expense for loans, which is recorded in provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.  Loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the related allowance for credit losses on loans.    
The allowance for credit losses on loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis.  Loans are aggregated into pools based on similar risk characteristics including borrower type, collateral type and expected credit loss patterns.  Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, primarily large loans on non-accrual status, are evaluated on an individual basis.  The allowance related to these large non-accrual loans is generally measured using the fair value of the collateral (less selling cost, if applicable) as most of these loans are collateral dependent and the borrower is facing financial difficulty.  
As noted above, the allowance for credit losses on loans does not include an allowance for accrued interest.
Liability for Unfunded Lending Commitments
The Company’s unfunded lending commitments are primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.  Expected credit losses for these unfunded lending commitments are calculated over the contractual period during which the Company is exposed to the credit risk.  The methodology used to measure credit losses for unfunded lending commitments is the same as the methodology used for loans, however, the estimate of credit risk for unfunded lending commitments takes into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur.  The liability for unfunded lending commitments excludes any exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company.  The loss estimate is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.  Changes to the liability for unfunded lending commitments are recorded through increases or decreases to the provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.
Direct Financing and Sales Type Leases
The net investment in direct financing and sales type leases is included in loans on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and consists of the present values of the sum of the future minimum lease payments and estimated residual value of the leased asset. Revenue consists of interest earned on the net investment and is recognized over the lease term as a constant percentage return thereon.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
The majority of the Company's investment portfolio is comprised of debt securities that are classified as available for sale.  From time to time, the Company sells securities and utilizes the proceeds to reduce borrowings, fund loan growth, or modify its interest rate profile.  Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value.  Changes in fair value are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity.  Securities are periodically evaluated for credit losses in accordance with the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326.  Further discussion of this 
75
Table of Contents
evaluation is provided in "
Allowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Debt Securities"
 below.  Gains and losses realized upon sales of securities are calculated using the specific identification method and are included in investment securities gains (losses), net, in the consolidated statements of income.  Purchase premiums and discounts are amortized to interest income using a level yield method over the estimated lives of the securities.  For certain callable debt securities purchased at a premium, the amortization is recorded to the earliest call date.  For mortgage and asset-backed securities, prepayment experience is evaluated quarterly to determine if a change in a bond's estimated remaining life is necessary.  A corresponding adjustment is then made in the related amortization of premium or discount accretion.      
Accrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities is reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  The Company has elected the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest from all required disclosures of amortized cost of debt securities. Additionally, an election was made not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables.  Interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.  
Equity securities include common and preferred stock and are carried at fair value.  Certain equity securities do not have readily determinable fair values.  The Company has elected to measure these equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.  The Company has not recorded any impairment or other adjustments to the carrying amount of these equity securities without readily determinable fair values.
Other securities include the Company's investments in Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock, equity method investments, and private equity investments.  Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock are held for debt and regulatory purposes, are carried at cost and are periodically evaluated for impairment.  The Company's equity method investments are carried at cost, adjusted to reflect the Company's portion of income, loss, or dividends of the investee. The Company's private equity investments in portfolio concerns, consisting of both debt and equity instruments, are held by the Company’s private equity subsidiary, which is a small business investment company licensed by the Small Business Administration. The Company's private equity investments are carried at fair value in accordance with investment company accounting guidance (ASC 946-10-15), with changes in fair value reported in current income.  In the absence of readily ascertainable market values, fair value is estimated using internally developed methods.  Changes in fair value which are recognized in current income and gains and losses from sales are included in investment securities gains (losses), net, in the consolidated statements of income.  
Trading account securities, which are debt securities bought and held principally for the purpose of resale in the near term, are carried at fair value.  Gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, are recorded in non-interest income.
Purchases and sales of securities are recognized on a trade date basis.  A receivable or payable is recognized for transaction pending settlements.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Debt Securities
For available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the entire loss in fair value is required to be recognized in current earnings if the Company intends to sell the securities or believes it more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery.  If neither condition is met, and the Company does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis, the Company determines whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit losses or other factors.  If the assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security.  If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss has occurred, and an allowance for credit losses is recorded.  The allowance for credit losses is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.  Any impairment not recorded through the provision for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.
Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.  Losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses on securities when management believes the uncollectibility of an available for sale security is confirmed or when either of the conditions regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.
Accrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase
Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions, not as purchases and sales of the underlying securities.  The agreements are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received.  
The Company periodically enters into securities purchased under agreements to resell with large financial institutions.     Securities pledged by the counterparties to secure these agreements are delivered to a third party custodian. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are a source of funding to the Company and are offered to cash management customers as an automated, collateralized investment account.  From time to time, securities sold may also be used by the Bank to obtain additional borrowed funds at favorable rates.  These borrowings are secured by a portion of the Company's investment security portfolio and delivered either to the dealer custody account at the Federal Reserve Bank or to the applicable counterparty.
The fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a counterparty is monitored daily, and additional collateral is obtained, returned, or provided by the Company in order to maintain full collateralization for these transactions.
As permitted by current accounting guidance, the Company offsets certain securities purchased under agreements to resell against securities sold under agreements to repurchase in its balance sheet presentation.  These agreements are further discussed in Note 20, Resale and Repurchase Agreements.

Premises and Equipment
Land is stated at cost, and buildings and equipment are stated at cost, including capitalized interest when appropriate, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method, utilizing estimated useful lives; generally 
30
 to 
40
 years for buildings, 
10
 years for building improvements, and 
3
 to 
10
 years for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of 
10
 years or the remaining lease term.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to non-interest expense as incurred.  
Also included in premises and equipment is construction in process, which represents facilities construction projects underway that have not yet been placed into service, as well as the Company's right-of-use leased assets, which are mainly comprised of operating leases for branches, office space, ATM locations, and certain equipment.

Foreclosed Assets
Foreclosed assets consist of property that has been repossessed and is comprised of commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto and recreational and marine vehicles. The assets are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs, establishing a new cost basis.  Initial valuation adjustments are charged to the allowance for credit losses.  Fair values are estimated primarily based on appraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing models.  After initial recognition, fair value estimates are updated periodically.  Declines in fair value below cost are recognized through valuation allowances which may be reversed when supported by future increases in fair value.  These valuation adjustments, in addition to gains and losses realized on sales and net operating expenses, are recorded in other non-interest expense.  Foreclosed assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives, such as property easement intangible assets, are not amortized but are assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company may initially perform a qualitative assessment. Based on the results of this qualitative assessment, if the Company concludes it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative analysis is performed. Quantitative valuation methodologies include a combination of formulas using current market multiples, based on recent sales of financial institutions within the Company's geographic marketplace.  If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment has occurred and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.  The Company has not recorded impairment resulting from goodwill impairment tests.  However, adverse changes in the economic environment, operations of the reporting unit, or other factors could result in a decline in fair value.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights, are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Core deposit intangibles are generally amortized over periods of 
8
 to 
14
 years, representing their estimated lives, using accelerated methods. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of 
77
Table of Contents
estimated net servicing income, considering appropriate prepayment assumptions. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset. Mortgage servicing rights, while initially recorded at fair value, are subsequently amortized and carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount (net of accumulated amortization), or estimated fair value.  The Company evaluates its mortgage servicing rights for impairment on a quarterly basis, using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans serviced and stratification based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans. A valuation allowance has been established, through a charge to earnings, to the extent the amortized cost exceeds the estimated fair value.  However, the Company has not recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses on its intangible assets.
Income Taxes
Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and income tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income when such assets and liabilities are anticipated to be settled or realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as tax expense or benefit in the period that includes the enactment date of the change. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets to recognize in the financial statements, the Company evaluates the likelihood of realizing such benefits in future periods.  A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return.  State and local income tax returns are filed on a combined, consolidated or separate return basis based upon each jurisdiction’s laws and regulations.
Additional information about current and deferred income taxes is provided in Note 9, Income Taxes.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income is mainly comprised of revenue from contracts with customers.  For that revenue (excluding certain revenue associated with financial instruments, derivative and hedging instruments, guarantees, lease contracts, transferring and servicing of financial assets, and other specific revenue transactions), the Company applies the following five-step approach when recognizing revenue: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.  The Company’s contracts with customers are generally short term in nature, with a duration of one year or less, and most contracts are cancellable by either the Company or its customer without penalty.  Performance obligations for customer contracts are generally satisfied at a single point in time, typically when the transaction is complete and the customer has received the goods or service, or over time.  For performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company recognizes the value of the goods or services transferred to the customer when the performance obligations have been transferred and received by the customer.  Payments for satisfied performance obligations are typically due when or as the goods or services are completed, or shortly thereafter, which usually occurs within a single financial reporting period.  
In situations where payment is made before the performance obligation is satisfied, the fees are deferred until the performance obligations pertaining to those goods or services are completed.  In cases where payment has not been received despite satisfaction of its performance obligations, the Company accrues an estimate of the amount due in the period that the performance obligations have been satisfied.  For contracts with variable components, the Company only recognizes revenue to the extent that it is probable that the cumulative amount recognized will not be subject to a significant reversal in future periods.  Generally, the Company’s contracts do not include terms that require significant judgment to determine whether a variable component is included within the transaction price.  The Company generally acts in a principal capacity, on its own behalf, in most of its contracts with customers.  For these transactions, revenue and the related costs to provide the goods or services are presented on a gross basis in the financial statements.  In some cases, the Company acts in an agent capacity, deriving revenue through assisting third parties in transactions with the Company’s customers.  In such transactions, revenue and the related costs to provide services is presented on a net basis in the financial statements.  These transactions primarily relate to fees earned from bank card and related network and rewards costs and beginning in August 2023, commissions on sales of consumer brokerage transactions and products.

Derivatives
The Company's derivative contracts are carried at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in current earnings.  They include interest rate swaps and caps, which are offered to customers to assist in managing their risks of adverse changes in interest rates.  Each contract between the Company and a customer is offset by a contract between the Company and an institutional counterparty, thus minimizing the Company's exposure to rate changes. The Company also enters into certain contracts, known as credit risk participation agreements, to buy or sell credit protection on specific interest rate swaps.  It also purchases and sells forward foreign exchange contracts, either in connection with customer transactions, or for its own trading purposes. Additionally, the Company originates and sells certain personal real estate mortgages.  Derivative instruments under this program include mortgage loan commitments, forward loan sale contracts, and forward contracts to sell certain to-be-announced (TBA) securities.
The Company's interest rate risk management policy permits the use of hedge accounting for derivatives, and the Company has entered into interest rate floor contracts as protection from the potential for declining interest rates in the commercial loan portfolio. These floors were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges. In a cash flow hedge, the changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the income statement when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. Both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether the interest rate floors used in the hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items. From time to time, the Company has monetized its interest rate floors that had previously been designated and qualified as cash flow hedges.  In such case, the monetized cash flow hedge is derecognized and the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) remain in AOCI until the underlying forecasted transaction impacts earnings, unless the forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring.  
The Company has master netting arrangements with various counterparties but does not offset derivative assets and liabilities under these arrangements in its consolidated balance sheets.  However, interest rate swaps that are executed under central clearing requirements are presented net of variation margin as mandated by the statutory terms of the Company's contract with its clearing counterparty.
Additional information about derivatives held by the Company and valuation methods employed is provided in Note 17, Fair Value Measurements and Note 19, Derivative Instruments.  
Cash flows associated with derivative instruments and their related gains and losses are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as operating activities.

Pension Plan
The Company’s pension plan is described in Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans.  In accordance with ASU 2017-07, the Company has reported the service cost component of net periodic pension cost in salaries and employee benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, while the other components are reported in other non-interest expense.  The funded status of the plan is recognized as an other asset or other liability in the consolidated balance sheets, and changes in that funded status are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income.  Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of the fiscal year end of the plan. The measurement of the projected benefit obligation and pension expense involve actuarial valuation methods and the use of various actuarial and economic assumptions. The Company monitors the assumptions and updates them periodically.  Due to the long-term nature of the pension plan obligation, actual results may differ significantly from estimations. Such differences are adjusted over time as the assumptions are replaced by facts and values are recalculated.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s stock-based compensation plan is described in Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation and Directors Stock Purchase Plan.  In accordance with the requirements of ASC 718-10-30-3 and 35-2, the Company measures the cost of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award, recognizing the cost over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of stock appreciation rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model while the fair value of a nonvested stock award is the common stock (CBSH) market price.  The expense recognized for stock-based compensation is included in salaries and benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  The Company recognizes forfeitures as a reduction to expense only when they have occurred.
Treasury Stock
Purchases of the Company’s common stock are recorded at cost. Upon re-issuance for acquisitions, exercises of stock-based awards or other corporate purposes, treasury stock is reduced based upon the average cost basis of shares held.

Table of Contents
Income per Share
Basic income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year.  Diluted income per share includes the effect of all dilutive potential common shares (primarily stock appreciation rights) outstanding during each year. The Company applies the two-class method of computing income per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines income per share for common stock and for participating securities, according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company’s nonvested stock awards are considered to be a class of participating security.  All per share data has been restated to reflect the 
5

Management believes all loans to directors and executive officers have been made in the ordinary course of business with normal credit terms, including interest rate and collateral considerations, and do not represent more than a normal risk of collection. The activity in the table above includes draws and repayments on several lines of credit with business entities. There were 
no
 outstanding loans at December 31, 2024 to principal holders (over 10% ownership) of the Company’s common stock.
The Company’s lending activity is generally centered in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois and other nearby states including Oklahoma, Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, and Texas. The Company maintains a diversified portfolio with limited industry concentrations of credit risk. Loans and loan commitments are extended under the Company’s normal credit standards, controls, and monitoring procedures. Most loan commitments are short or intermediate term in nature. Commercial loan maturities generally range from one to seven years. Collateral is commonly required and would include such assets as marketable securities, cash equivalent assets, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, other forms of personal property, and real estate. At December 31, 2024, unfunded loan commitments totaled
 $
15.4
 billion (which included $

Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses is measured using an average historical loss model which incorporates relevant information about past events (including historical credit loss experience on loans with similar risk characteristics), current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the loans.  The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis.  Loans are aggregated into pools based on similar risk characteristics including borrower type, collateral type and expected credit loss patterns. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, primarily large loans on non-accrual status, are evaluated on an individual basis.  
For loans evaluated for credit losses on a collective basis, average historical loss rates are calculated for each pool using the Company’s historical net charge-offs (combined charge-offs and recoveries by observable historical reporting period) and outstanding loan balances during a lookback period.  Lookback periods can be different based on the individual pool and represent management’s credit expectations for the pool of loans over the remaining contractual life.  In certain loan pools, if the Company’s own historical loss rate is not reflective of the loss expectations, the historical loss rate is augmented by industry and peer data.  The calculated average net charge-off rate is then adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  These adjustments increase or decrease the average historical loss rate to reflect expectations of future losses given a single path economic forecast of key macroeconomic variables including GDP, disposable income, unemployment rate, various interest rates, consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate, housing price index (HPI), commercial real estate price index (CREPI) and market volatility.  The adjustments are based on results from various regression models projecting the impact of the macroeconomic variables to loss rates.  The forecast is used for a reasonable and supportable period before reverting back to historical averages using a straight-line method.  The forecast-adjusted loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of loans over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for expected prepayments.  The contractual term excludes expected extensions (except for contractual extensions at the option of the customer), renewals and modifications. Credit cards and certain similar consumer lines of credit do not have stated maturities and therefore, for these loan classes, remaining contractual lives are determined by estimating future cash flows expected to be received from customers until payments have been fully allocated to outstanding balances.   Additionally, the allowance for credit losses considers other qualitative factors not included in historical loss rates or macroeconomic forecast such as changes in portfolio composition, underwriting practices, or significant unique events or conditions.

Qualitative factors
Added qualitative factors related to:
•
Changes in the composition of the loan portfolios
•
Certain industries experiencing stress or emerging concerns within the portfolio
•
Loans downgraded to special mention, substandard, or non-accrual status
•
Consumer auto portfolio
•
Certain portfolios where the model assumptions do not capture all identified loss risk
Added qualitative factors related to:
•
Changes in the composition of the loan portfolios
•
Certain stressed industries within the portfolio
•
Certain portfolios sensitive to unusually high rate of inflation and supply chain issues
•
Loans downgraded to special mention, substandard, or non-accrual status
The liability for unfunded lending commitments utilizes the same model as the allowance for credit losses on loans, however, the liability for unfunded lending commitments incorporates an assumption for the portion of unfunded commitments that are expected to be funded.  
Sensitivity in the Allowance for Credit Loss model
The allowance for credit losses is an estimate that requires significant judgment including projections of the macro-economic environment.  The forecasted macro-economic environment continuously changes which can cause fluctuations in estimated expected credit losses.  
The current forecast projects the economy will continue to see a low unemployment rate. The Federal Reserve's path of monetary policy is less certain given the upcoming change in US presidential administration as a result of the November 2024 election. 
Updated information on inflation and labor market trends could impact the Federal Reserve's decision on the timing and degree of rate reductions. The market's response to these events along with other economic, political, and social developments regionally, nationally and even globally could significantly modify economic projections used in the estimation of the allowance for credit losses. 
83
Table of Contents
Potential changes in any one economic variable 
may or may not
 affect the overall allowance because a variety of economic variables and inputs are considered in estimating allowance, and changes in those variables and inputs may not occur at the same rate, may not be consistent across product types and may have offsetting impacts to other changing variables and inputs.

Credit quality indicators
The following table provides information about the credit quality of the Commercial loan portfolio.  The Company utilizes an internal risk rating system comprised of a series of grades to categorize loans according to perceived risk associated with the expectation of debt repayment based on borrower specific information, including but not limited to, current financial information, historical payment experience, industry information, collateral levels and collateral types.  The “pass” category consists of a range of loan grades that reflect increasing, though still acceptable, risk.  A loan is assigned the risk rating at origination and then monitored throughout the contractual term for possible risk rating changes.  Movement of risk through the various grade levels in the “pass” category is monitored for early identification of credit deterioration.  The “special mention” rating is applied to loans where the borrower exhibits negative financial trends due to borrower specific or systemic conditions that, if left uncorrected, threaten its capacity to meet its debt obligations. The borrower is believed to have sufficient financial flexibility to react to and resolve its negative financial situation. It is a transitional grade that is closely monitored for improvement or deterioration.  The “substandard” rating is applied to loans where the borrower exhibits well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize its continued performance and are of a severity that the distinct possibility of default exists. Loans are placed on “non-accrual” when management does not expect to collect payments consistent with acceptable and agreed upon terms of repayment.
All loans are analyzed for risk rating updates annually.  For larger loans, rating assessments may be more frequent if relevant information is obtained earlier through debt covenant monitoring or overall relationship management.  Smaller loans are monitored as identified by the loan officer based on the risk profile of the individual borrower or if the loan becomes past due related to credit issues. Loans rated Special Mention, Substandard or Non-accrual are subject to quarterly review and monitoring processes.  In addition to the regular monitoring performed by the lending personnel and credit committees, loans are subject to review by a credit review department which verifies the appropriateness of the risk ratings for the loans chosen as part of its risk-based review plan.

Modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty

When borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty, the Company may agree to modify the contractual terms of a loan to a borrower in order to assist the borrower in repaying principal and interest owed to the Company. 
The Company's modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are generally in the form of term extensions, repayment plans, payment deferrals, forbearance agreements, interest rate reductions, forgiveness of interest and/or fees, or any combination thereof.  Commercial loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are primarily loans that are substandard or non-accrual, where the maturity date was extended.  Modifications on personal real estate loans are primarily those placed on forbearance plans, repayment plans, or deferral plans where monthly payments are suspended for a period of time or past due amounts are paid off over a certain period of time in the future or set up as a balloon payment at maturity.  Modifications to certain credit card and other small consumer loans are often modified under debt counseling programs that can reduce the contractual rate or, in certain instances, forgive certain fees and interest charges.  Other consumer loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consist of various other workout arrangements with consumer customers.
The following tables present the amortized cost at December 31, 2024 of loans that were modified during the year ended December 31, 2024 and the amortized cost at December 31, 2023 of loans that were modified during the year ended December 31, 2023.

The estimate of lifetime expected losses utilized in the allowance for credit losses model is developed using average historical experience on loans with similar risk characteristics, which includes losses from modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. As a result, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification.  For modifications to loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that are placed on non-accrual status, the Company determines the allowance for credit losses on an individual evaluation, using the same process that it utilizes for other loans on non-accrual status.  Modifications made to commercial loans which are not on non-accrual status for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are collectively evaluated based on internal risk rating, loan type, delinquency, historical experience, and current economic factors.  Modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for personal banking loans which are not on non-accrual status are collectively evaluated based on loan type, delinquency, historical experience, and current economic factors.  
If a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is modified and subsequently deemed uncollectible, the allowance for credit losses continues to be based on individual evaluation, if that loan is already on non-accrual status.  For those loans, the allowance for credit losses is estimated using discounted expected cash flows or the fair value of collateral.  If an accruing loan made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is modified and subsequently deemed uncollectible, the loan's risk rating is downgraded to non-accrual status and the loan's related allowance for credit losses is determined based on individual evaluation, or if necessary, the loan is charged off and collection efforts begin.
The following tables summarize the financial impact of loan modifications and payment deferrals during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Loans held for sale

The Company designates certain long-term fixed rate personal real estate loans as held for sale, and the Company has elected the fair value option for these loans.  The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for these loans with the related economic hedges discussed in Note 19.  The loans are primarily sold to FNMA and FHLMC. At December 31, 2024, the fair value of these loans was $
3.0
 million, and the unpaid principal balance was $
2.9
 million.
At December 31, 2024, 
none
 of the loans held for sale were on non-accrual status or 90 days past due and still accruing.  
Foreclosed real estate/repossessed assets
The Company’s holdings of foreclosed real estate totaled $
343
 thousand and $
270
 thousand at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and included in those amounts were $
343
 thousand and $
270
 thousand of foreclosed residential real estate properties held as a result of obtaining physical possession at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  Personal property acquired in repossession, generally autos, marine and recreational vehicles (RV), totaled $
2.2
 million and $
1.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Upon acquisition, these assets are recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis.  They are subsequently carried at the lower of this cost basis or fair value less estimated selling costs.

Most of the Company’s investment securities are classified as available for sale debt securities, and this portfolio is discussed in more detail below. The Company’s equity securities are also discussed below.  Other investment securities include Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, and investments in portfolio concerns held by the Company’s private equity subsidiary. FRB stock and FHLB stock are held for liquidity management and regulatory purposes. Investment in FRB stock is based on the capital structure of the investing bank, and investment in FHLB stock is tied to the asset size of the borrowing bank and the level of borrowings from the FHLB. These holdings are carried at cost. The Company’s private equity investments are carried at estimated fair value.
Equity Securities
The Company’s equity securities portfolio includes mutual funds, common stock, and preferred stock with readily determinable fair values as well as equity securities with no readily determinable fair value.  The Company has elected to measure equity securities with no readily determinable fair value at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.  At March 31, 2024, this portfolio included the Company’s 
823,447
 shares of Visa Inc. (“Visa”) Class B-1 common stock (formerly Class B common stock), which were held by Commerce Bancshares, Inc.  The Company’s Visa Class B-1 shares had a carrying value of 
zero
 at March 31, 2024, as there had not been observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.  
On April 8, 2024, Visa announced the commencement of a public offering to permit the exchange of its Class B-1 common stock for a combination of shares of its Class B-2 common stock and its Class C common stock (“Exchange Offer”).  The Company tendered all of its Visa Class B-1 shares pursuant to the Exchange Offer.  On May 3, 2024, the Exchange Offer closed, and in exchange for its 
823,447
 shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock, the Company received 
411,723
 shares of Visa Class B-2 common stock (which will be convertible under certain circumstances, as further described below, into Visa’s publicly traded Class A common stock at an initial rate of 
1.5875
 shares of Class A common for each share of Class B-2 common stock, subject to adjustment) and 
163,404
 shares of Visa Class C common stock which automatically convert into four shares of Visa's Class A common stock (subject to future adjustments for any stock splits, recapitalizations or similar transactions) upon any transfer to a person other than a Visa member or an affiliate of a Visa member.  
As a condition of participating in the exchange, the Company entered into a Makewhole Agreement with Visa that provides for cash payments to Visa to the extent (if any) that future adjustments to the conversion ratio for the Visa Class B-2 common stock to Class A common stock cause such ratio to fall below zero.  Changes to the conversion ratio occur when Visa deposits funds to a litigation escrow established by Visa to pay settlements for certain covered litigation that pre-dated Visa’s initial public offering, for which Visa has been effectively indemnified by Visa USA members through reductions to the conversion ratio for its Class B-1 common stock.  The purpose of the Makewhole Agreement is to preserve the economic benefit of these adjustments to the Class B-1 conversion ratio for the benefit of Visa’s Class A and Class C common stockholders following the exchange.  As further described in Visa’s related Issuer Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and Prospectus, each dated April 8, 2024, publicly filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, both the Makewhole Agreement and the related escrow fund and transfer restrictions on Visa’s Class B-1 common stock and the new Class B-2 common stock will terminate whenever the covered litigation is ultimately resolved, at which future date outstanding shares of Visa Class B-2 common stock will be convertible into shares of its Class A common stock at the then-applicable conversion ratio. 
95
Table of Contents
As a result of the exchange, the Company elected the measurement alternative approach for its Visa Class C common stock and marked the stock to fair value, recording a gain based on the conversion privilege of the Visa Class C common stock and the closing price of Visa Class A common stock.  During the second quarter of 2024, the Company sold 
436
 thousand shares of Visa Class A common stock at an average price of $
274.91
, resulting in proceeds of $
119.8
 million.  During the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold 
218
 thousand Visa Class A shares at an average price of $
260.56
, resulting of proceeds of $
56.8
 million.  As of September 30, 2024, the Company had sold all of the Visa Class C shares it received from the Visa Exchange Offer.  The Company’s Visa Class B-2 common stock will continue to be carried at cost of $
0
 as the Company elected the measurement alternative approach for these shares as well, and there are not observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer for the Visa Class B-2 shares held by the Company.

Available for sale debt securities portfolio 

The majority of the Company’s investment portfolio is comprised of available for sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).  The investment portfolio includes agency mortgage-backed securities, which are guaranteed by agencies such as FHLMC, FNMA, and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), in addition to non-agency mortgage-backed securities, which have no guarantee but are collateralized by commercial and residential mortgages.  Also included are certain other asset-backed securities, which are primarily collateralized by credit cards, automobiles, student loans, and commercial loans. These securities differ from traditional debt securities primarily in that they may have uncertain maturity dates and are priced based on estimated prepayment rates on the underlying collateral. 
A summary of the available for sale debt securities by maturity groupings as of December 31, 2024 is shown below.  In the table below, the weighted average yield for the year ended December 31, 2024 is calculated based on amortized cost and has not been tax equated.

Rate does not reflect inflation adjustment on inflation-protected securities
Investments in U.S. government and federal agency obligations include U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities, which totaled $
405.4
 million, at fair value, at December 31, 2024. Interest paid on these securities increases with inflation and decreases with deflation, as measured by the non-seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).  At maturity, the principal paid is the greater of an inflation-adjusted principal or the original principal. 
Allowance for credit losses on available for sale debt securities
Securities for which fair value is less than amortized cost are reviewed for impairment.  Special emphasis is placed on securities whose credit rating has fallen below Baa3 (Moody's) or BBB- (Standard & Poor's), whose fair values have fallen more than 
20
% below purchase price, or those which have been identified based on management’s judgment.  These securities are placed on a watch list and cash flow analyses are prepared on an individual security basis.  Certain securities are analyzed using a projected cash flow model, discounted to present value, and compared to the current amortized cost bases of the securities.  The model uses input factors such as cash flow projections, contractual payments required, expected delinquency rates, credit support from other tranches, prepayment speeds, collateral loss severity rates (including loan to values), and various other information related to the underlying collateral.  Securities not analyzed using the cash flow model are analyzed by reviewing credit ratings, credit support agreements, and industry knowledge to project future cash flows and any possible credit impairment.  
At December 31, 2024, the fair value of securities on this watch list was $
1.6
 billion compared to $
1.2
 billion at December 31, 2023.  Almost all of the securities included on the Company's watch list were experiencing unrealized loss positions due to the significant increase in interest rates and were analyzed outside of the cash flow model.  At December 31, 
97
Table of Contents
2024, the securities on the Company's watch list that were not deemed to be solely related to increasing interest rates were securities backed by government-guaranteed student loans and are expected to perform as contractually required.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not identify any securities for which a credit loss exists, and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize a credit loss expense on any available for sale debt securities.  
The table below summarizes debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, aggregated by length of loss period, for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Unrealized losses on these available for sale securities have not been recognized into income because after review, the securities were deemed not to be impaired.  The unrealized losses on these securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and current market conditions.  At December 31, 2024, the Company does not intend to sell the securities, nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any of these securities at a loss.

Subsequent to the successful close of the Exchange Offer in May 2024, the Company approved and executed a plan to reposition a portion of its available for sale debt securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024 through the sale of securities with an amortized cost of $
1.2
 billion.  The securities that the Company sold had a yield of approximately 
2.1
%, which resulted in a loss of $
179.1
 million, and the Company reinvested $
928.8
 million of the proceeds into U.S. Treasury securities yielding approximately 
4.6
%.
Pledged securities

During 2023, the Company wrote off $
25.7
 million of core deposit intangible assets that were fully amortized. Also during 2023, the Company acquired L.J. Hart & Company, a municipal bond underwriter and advisor, and the acquisition resulted in goodwill of $
7.6
 million.

Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized over the period of estimated servicing income.  They are periodically reviewed for impairment at a tranche level, and if impairment is indicated, recorded at fair value.  Temporary impairment, including impairment recovery, is effected through a change in a valuation allowance. During 2024, 
no
 impairment or impairment recovery was recognized.  The fair value of the MSRs is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, as further discussed in Note 17 on Fair Value Measurements.
 Aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
1.3
 million, $
1.4
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively.  
The following table shows the estimated future amortization expense based on existing asset balances and the interest rate environment as of December 31, 2024.  The Company’s actual amortization expense in any given period may be different from the estimated amounts depending upon the acquisition of intangible assets, changes in mortgage interest rates, prepayment rates and other market conditions.

Leases
The Company's leasing activities include leasing certain real estate and equipment, providing lease financing to commercial customers, and leasing office space to third parties.  The Company uses the FHLB fixed-advance rate at lease commencement or at any subsequent remeasurement event date based on the remaining lease term to calculate the liability for each lease.

Table of Contents
Lessee
The Company's operating leases are primarily for branches, office space, ATM locations, and certain equipment.  As of December 31, 2024, the right-of-use asset for 
operating leases, reported within premises and equipment, net
, and 
lease liability, reported within other liabilities
, recognized on the Company's consolidated balance sheets totaled $
30.7
 million and $
31.2
 million, respectively, compared to right-of-use assets of $
26.5
 million and lease liability of $
26.9
 million at December 31, 2023.  Total lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $
8.5
 million, compared to $
8.3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, an election was made not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all asset classes, and to recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company's leases have remaining terms of 
1
 month to 
27
 years, most of which contain renewal options.  However, the renewal options are generally not included in the leased asset or liability because the option exercises are uncertain. 
The maturities of operating leases at December 31, 2024 are included in the table below.

The Company has net investments in direct financing and sales-type leases to commercial, industrial, and tax-exempt entities.  These leases are included within business loans on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  The Company primarily leases various types of equipment, trucks and trailers, and office furniture and fixtures.  Lease agreements may include options for the lessee to renew or purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term.  The Company has elected to adopt the lease component expedient in which the lease and nonlease components are combined into the total lease receivable.  The Company also leases office space to third parties, and these leases are classified as operating leases.  The leases may include options to renew or to expand the leased space, and currently the leases have remaining terms of 
3
 months to 
14
 years.

Management believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the total deferred tax assets, therefore, no valuation allowance is needed for the deferred tax assets at year end. 
A reconciliation between the expected federal income tax expense using the federal statutory tax rate of 
21
%, and the Company's actual income tax expense for 2024, 2023, and 2022 is provided below.  The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income taxes by income before income taxes less the non-controlling interest expense.

A portion of the Company’s employees are covered by a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, however, participation in the pension plan is not available to employees hired after June 30, 2003. All participants are fully vested in their benefit payable upon normal retirement date, which is based on years of participation and compensation.  Since January 2011, all benefits accrued under the pension plan have been frozen.  However, the accounts continue to accrue interest at a stated annual rate.  Certain key executives also participate in a supplemental executive retirement plan (the CERP) that the Company funds only as retirement benefits are disbursed. The CERP carries no segregated assets. The CERP continues to provide credits based on hypothetical contributions in excess of those permitted under the 401(k) plan.  In the tables presented below, the pension plan and the CERP are presented on a combined basis.
Under the Company’s funding policy for the defined benefit pension plan, contributions are made to a trust as necessary to satisfy the statutory minimum required contribution as defined by the Pension Protection Act, which is intended to provide for current service accruals and for any unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities over a reasonable period.  To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the trust, a contribution might not be made in a particular year.  
No
 contributions to the defined benefit plan were made in 2024, 2023 or 2022.  The minimum required contribution for 2025 is expected to be 
zero
.  The Company does not expect to make any further contributions in 2025 other than the necessary funding contributions to the CERP.  Distributions under the CERP were $
185
 thousand, $
806
 thousand and $
14
 thousand during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The investment policy of the pension plan is designed for conservation of principal, within limits designed to safeguard against significant losses within the portfolio. The policy sets guidelines, which may change from time to time, regarding the types and percentages of investments held.  Currently, the policy includes guidelines such as holding bonds rated investment grade or better and prohibiting investment in Company stock.  The plan does not utilize derivatives. Management believes there are no significant concentrations of risk within the plan asset portfolio at December 31, 2024.  Under the current policy, the long-term investment target mix for the plan is 
10
% equity securities and 
90
% fixed income securities. The Company regularly reviews its policies on investment mix and may make changes depending on economic conditions and perceived investment risk.

Table of Contents
The assumed overall expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets used in calculating 2024 pension plan expense was 
4.75
%. Determination of the plan’s expected rate of return is based upon historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. The rate used in plan calculations may be adjusted by management for current trends in the economic environment. The 10-year annualized return for the Company’s pension plan was 
4.3
%.  During 2024, the plan’s assets gained 
2.9
% of their value, compared to a gain of 
10.3
% in 2023.  Returns for any plan year may be affected by changes in the stock market and interest rates.  The Company expects to incur pension expense of $
1.8
 million in 2025, compared to $
1.3
 million in 2024.

Stock-Based Compensation and Directors Stock Purchase Plan* 
The Company’s stock-based compensation is provided under a stockholder-approved plan that allows for issuance of various types of awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance awards and stock-based awards. During the past three years, stock-based compensation has been issued in the form of nonvested restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights.  At December 31, 2024, 
6,087,048
 shares remained available for issuance under the plan.  The stock-based compensation expense that was charged against income was $
17.0
 million, $
17.1
 million and $
17.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation arrangements was $
3.2
 million, $
3.2
 million and $
3.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.   
Nonvested Restricted Stock Awards 
Nonvested stock is awarded to key employees by action of the Company's Compensation and Human Resources Committee and Board of Directors.  These awards generally vest after 
4
 to 
7
 years of continued employment, but vesting terms may vary according to the specifics of the individual grant agreement.  There are restrictions as to transferability, sale, pledging, or assigning, among others, prior to the end of the vesting period.

In determining compensation cost, the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of SARs on date of grant.  The Black-Scholes model is a closed-end model that uses various assumptions as shown in the following table.  Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock.  The Company uses historical exercise behavior and other factors to estimate the expected term of the SARs, which represents the period of time that the SARs granted are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free rate for the expected term is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon spot rates in effect at the time of grant.   
The per share average fair value and the model assumptions for SARs granted during the past three years are shown in the table below.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
 The table below shows the activity and accumulated balances for components of other comprehensive income.  The largest component is the unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale debt securities.  Another component is the amortization from other comprehensive income of losses associated with pension benefits, which occurs as the losses are included in current net periodic pension cost.  The remaining component is gains and losses in fair value on certain interest rate floors that have been designated as cash flow hedges, including interest rate floors terminated in prior years.  For those terminated floors, the realized gains are amortized into interest income through the original maturity dates of the floors.  Information about unrealized gains and losses on securities can be found in Note 3, information about unrealized gains and losses on pension plans can be found in Note 10, and information about unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedge derivatives is located in Note 19.

13. 
Segments
The Company segregates financial information for use in assessing its performance and allocating resources among 
three
 operating segments:  Consumer, Commercial, and Wealth.  The Consumer segment consists of various consumer loan and deposit products offered through its retail branch network of approximately 
140
 locations.  This segment also includes residential mortgage, indirect and other consumer loan financing businesses, along with debit and credit card loan and fee businesses.  
The Commercial segment provides corporate lending (including the Small Business Banking product line within the branch network), leasing, and international services, along with business and governmental deposit products and commercial cash management services.  This segment also includes both merchant and commercial bank card products as well as the Commercial Tradable Products division, which sells fixed-income securities, underwrites municipal bonds and provides securities safekeeping and accounting services to its business and correspondent bank customers.  The Wealth segment provides traditional trust and estate planning, advisory and discretionary investment management, and brokerage services.  This segment also provides various loan and deposit related services to its private banking customers. 
The Company’s business line reporting system derives segment information from the internal profitability reporting system used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the Company.  This information is based on internal management accounting procedures and methods, which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the businesses.  These methodologies are applied in connection with funds transfer pricing and assignment of overhead costs 
112
Table of Contents
among segments.  Funds transfer pricing was used in the determination of net interest income.  A standard cost for funds used is applied to assets, and a credit for funds provided is applied to liabilities based on their maturity, prepayment and/or repricing characteristics.  Income and expense that directly relate to segment operations are recorded in the segment when incurred. Expenses that indirectly support the segments are allocated based on the most appropriate method available.
The Company uses a funds transfer pricing method to value funds used (e.g., loans, fixed assets, and cash) and funds provided (e.g., deposits, borrowings, and equity) by the business segments and their components.  This process assigns a specific value to each new source or use of funds with a maturity, based on current swap rates, thus determining an interest spread at the time of the transaction. Non-maturity assets and liabilities are valued using weighted average pools.  The funds transfer pricing process attempts to remove interest rate risk from valuation, allowing management to compare profitability under various rate environments.  
The Company’s chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker ("CODM").  The CODM is the primary individual in control of resource allocation, and the allocation determinations are made in consultation with the Company’s executive management committee, of which the CODM is a member.  The Company’s CODM primarily utilizes net income before taxes to evaluate each segment’s performance and allocate resources (including employees, financial, or capital resources), primarily through the Company’s annual budgeting process and periodic segment performance reviews.  To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, the CODM is regularly provided and reviews total non-interest expense at a consolidated level and total non-interest expense for each segment.  
The following tables present selected financial information by segment and reconciliations of combined segment totals to  consolidated totals.  There were 
no
 material intersegment revenues between the three segments.  Management periodically makes changes to methods of assigning costs and income to its business segments to better reflect operating results.  If appropriate, these changes are reflected in prior year information presented below.  Net interest income allocated among the segments prior to 2024 has been restated to reflect a funds transfer pricing methodology change implemented on January 1, 2024 for all deposit types, except certificates of deposit.  The new methodology moves from a rolling pool to a profitability range methodology.  The new methodology more accurately reflects the profitability of affected deposits relative to current rates and removes most interest rate risk from business segments.  Additionally, the Company changed its management of its portfolio of residential mortgage loans that it retains, and as a result, the Company began including those loans in the Consumer segment on January 1, 2023.  These loans had previously been included in the Other/Elimination column.  As a result of this change, loans of approximately $
1.9
 billion were reclassified from the Other/Elimination column into the Consumer segment in 2023 and prior periods presented below were restated to also reflect this change.

Amounts in the “Other/Elimination” column include activity not related to the segments, such as that relating to administrative functions, the investment securities portfolio, and the effect of certain expense allocations to the segments.  The provision for credit losses in this category contains the difference between net loan charge-offs assigned directly to the segments and the recorded provision for credit loss expense.  Included in this category’s net interest income are earnings of the investment portfolio, which are not allocated to a segment.  Additionally, interest expense on the Company's brokered deposits, is included in this column, as the Company's brokered deposits are not allocated to a segment.

Table of Contents
The Company’s reportable segments are strategic lines of business that offer different products and services.  They are managed separately because each line services a specific customer need, requiring different performance measurement analyses and marketing strategies.  The performance measurement of the segments is based on the management structure of the Company and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution.  The information is also not necessarily indicative of the segments’ financial condition and results of operations if they were independent entities.

Common Stock*
On December 18, 2024, the Company distributed a 
5
% stock dividend on its $
5
 par common stock for the 31st consecutive year.  All per common share data in this report has been restated to reflect the stock dividend.
The Company applies the two-class method of computing income per share, as nonvested share-based awards that pay non-forfeitable common stock dividends are considered securities which participate in undistributed earnings with common stock.  The two-class method requires the calculation of separate income per share amounts for the nonvested share-based awards and for common stock.  Income per share attributable to common stock is shown in the following table.  Nonvested share-based awards are further discussed in Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation.
Basic income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the year.  
Presented below is a summary of the components used to calculate basic and diluted income per common share, which have been restated for all stock dividends.

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. The regulations require the Company to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital classification is also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
The following tables show the capital amounts and ratios for the Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank, together with the minimum capital adequacy and well-capitalized capital requirements, at the last two year ends.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenue from contracts with customers, Accounting Standard Codification 606 ("ASC 606"), requires revenue recognition for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 
63
% of the Company’s total revenue was comprised of net interest income, which is not within the scope of this guidance.  Of the remaining revenue, those items that were subject to this guidance mainly included fees for bank card, trust, deposit account services and consumer brokerage services.

The

Commercial
 segment.
Debit and Credit Card Fees
The Company issues debit and credit cards to its retail and commercial banking customers who use the cards to purchase goods and services from merchants through an electronic payment system. As a card issuer, the Company earns fees, including interchange income, for processing the cardholder’s purchase transaction with a merchant through a settlement network. Purchases are charged directly to a customer’s checking account (in the case of a debit card), or are posted to a customer’s credit card account.  The fees earned are established by the settlement network and are dependent on the type of transaction processed but are typically based on a per unit charge. Interchange income, the largest component of debit and credit card fees, is settled daily through the networks.  The services provided to the cardholders include issuing and maintaining cards, settling purchases with merchants, and maintaining memberships in various card networks to facilitate processing.  These services are considered one performance obligation, as one of the services would not be performed without the others. The performance obligation is satisfied as services are rendered for each purchase transaction, and income is immediately recognized.
In order to participate in the settlement network process, the Company must pay various transaction-related costs, established by the networks, including membership fees and a per unit charge for each transaction.  These expenses are recorded net of the card fees earned.
Consumer credit card products offer cardholders rewards that can be later redeemed for cash, goods or services to encourage card usage.  Reward programs must meet network requirements based on the type of card issued.  The expense associated with the rewards granted are recorded net of the credit card fees earned.
Commercial card products offer cash rewards to corporate cardholders to encourage card usage in facilitating corporate payments.  The Company pays cash rewards based on contractually agreed upon amounts, normally as a percent of each sales transaction.  The expense associated with the cash rewards program is recorded net of the corporate card fees earned.
119
Table of Contents
Merchant Fees
The Company offers merchant processing services to its business customers to enable them to accept credit and debit card payments.  Merchant processing activities include gathering merchant sales information, authorizing sales transactions and collecting the funds from card issuers using the networks. The merchant is charged a merchant discount fee for the services based on agreed upon pricing between the merchant and the Company.   Merchant fees are recorded net of outgoing interchange costs paid to the card issuing banks and net of other network costs as shown in the table above.
Merchant services provided are considered one performance obligation, as one of the services would not be performed without the others.  The performance obligation is satisfied as services are rendered for each settlement transaction and income is immediately recognized.  Income earned from merchant fees settles with the customer according to terms negotiated in individual customer contracts.  The majority of customers settle with the Company at least monthly.

The Company provides trust and asset management services to both private client and institutional trust customers including asset custody, investment advice, and reporting and administrative services.  Other specialized services such as tax preparation, financial planning, representation and other related services are provided as needed.  Trust fees are generally earned monthly and billed based on a rate multiplied by the fair value of the customer's trust assets.  The majority of customer trust accounts are billed monthly.   However, some accounts are billed quarterly, and a small number of accounts are billed semi-annually or annually, in accordance with agreements in place with the customer.  The Company accrues trust fees monthly based on an estimate of fees due and either directly charges the customer’s account the following month or invoices the customer for fees due according to the billing schedule.
The Company maintains written product pricing information which is used to bill each trust customer based on the services provided.  Providing trust services is considered to be a single performance obligation that is satisfied on a monthly basis, involving the monthly custody of customer assets, statement rendering, periodic investment advice where applicable, and other specialized services as needed.  As such, performance obligations are considered to be satisfied at the conclusion of each month while trust fee income is also recognized monthly.

The Company provides corporate cash management services to its business and non-profit customers to meet their various transaction processing needs.  Such services include deposit and check processing, lockbox, remote deposit, reconciliation, online banking and other similar transaction processing services.  The Company maintains unit prices for each type of service, and the customer is billed based on transaction volumes processed monthly.  The customer is usually billed either monthly or 
120
Table of Contents
quarterly, however, some customers may be billed semi-annually or annually.   The customer may pay for the cash management services either by paying in cash or using the value of deposit balances (formula provided to the customer) held at the Company.  The Company’s performance obligation for corporate cash management services is the processing of items over a monthly term, and the obligations are satisfied at the conclusion of each month.
Overdraft fees are charged to customers when daily checks and other withdrawals to customers’ accounts exceed balances on hand.  Fees are based on a unit price multiplied by the number of items processed whose total amounts exceed the available account balance.  The daily overdraft charge is calculated, and the fee is posted to the customer’s account each day.  The Company’s performance obligation for overdraft transactions is based on the daily transaction processed and the obligation is satisfied as each day’s transaction processing is concluded. 
Other deposit fees include numerous smaller fees such as monthly statement fees, foreign ATM processing fees, identification restoration fees, and stop payment fees.  Such fees are mostly billed to customers directly on their monthly deposit account statements, or in the case of foreign ATM processing fees, the fee is charged to the customer on the day that transactions are processed.  Performance obligations for all of these various services are satisfied at the time that the service is rendered.
Consumer Brokerage Services
Consumer brokerage services revenue is comprised of commissions received upon the execution of purchases and sales of mutual fund shares and equity securities, in addition to sales of annuities and certain limited insurance products, in an agency capacity.  Also, commissions are earned on professionally managed advisory programs.  Revenue from these services is generally recognized as a commission at the time of the transaction’s execution.  Mutual fund and other distribution fees are recognized upon initial transaction execution as well as in future periods as customers continue to hold amounts in those mutual funds.  Commission revenue for advisory services is recognized ratably over the contract term.  
Nearly all
 of the Company’s consumer brokerage services revenue is recorded in the Wealth segment.     
Other Non-Interest Income from Contracts with Customers
Other non-interest income from contracts with customers consists mainly of various transaction-driven revenue streams such as ATM fees, check sales and wire fees, cash sweep commissions, underwriting fees, and gains on sales of tax credits.  Performance obligations for these services consist mainly of the execution of a single transaction at a single point in time.  Fees from these revenue sources are recognized when the performance obligation is completed, at which time cash is received by the Company.

Fair Value Measurements 
The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.  Various financial instruments such as available for sale debt securities, equity securities, trading debt securities, certain investments relating to private equity activities, and derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.  Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as mortgage servicing rights and certain other investment securities.  These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve lower of cost or fair value accounting, or write-downs of individual assets.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value.  For accounting disclosure purposes, a three-level valuation hierarchy of fair value measurements has been established.  The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.  The three levels are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
•
Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly (such as interest rates, yield curves, and prepayment speeds). 
•
Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. These may be internally developed, using the Company’s best information and assumptions that a market participant would consider.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded or disclosed at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to observable market data for similar assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets, and the Company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive an estimated fair value measurement.

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis
Following is a description of the Company’s valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
Residential mortgage loans held for sale
The Company originates fixed rate, first lien residential mortgage loans that are intended for sale in the secondary market.  Fair value is based on quoted secondary market prices for loans with similar characteristics, which are adjusted to include the embedded servicing value in the loans.  This adjustment represents an unobservable input to the valuation but is not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the valuation to changes in this input.  Accordingly, these loan measurements are classified as Level 2.
Available for sale debt securities
For available for sale securities, changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income.  This portfolio comprises the majority of the assets which the Company records at fair value. Most of the portfolio, which includes government-sponsored enterprise, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, are priced utilizing industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.  Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  These measurements are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the measurements are classified as Level 1.  Most of the Level 1 measurements apply to U.S. Treasury obligations. 
The fair values of Level 1 and 2 securities in the available for sale portfolio are prices provided by a third-party pricing service.  The prices provided by the third-party pricing service are based on observable market inputs, as described in the sections below.  On a quarterly basis, the Company compares these prices to other independent sources for the same and similar securities.  Variances are analyzed, and, if appropriate, additional research is conducted with the third-party pricing service.  Based on this research, the pricing service may affirm or revise its quoted price.  No significant adjustments have been made to the prices provided by the pricing service.  The pricing service also provides documentation on an ongoing basis that includes reference data, inputs and methodology by asset class, which is reviewed by the Company to ensure that security placement within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate.
Valuation methods and inputs, by class of security: 
•
U.S. government and federal agency obligations 
     U.S. treasury bills, bonds and notes, including inflation-protected securities, are valued using quoted prices from active markets.  
•
Government-sponsored enterprise obligations
      Government-sponsored enterprise obligations are evaluated using cash flow valuation models.  Inputs used are live market data, cash settlements, Treasury market yields, and floating rate indices such as SOFR, CMT, and Prime.
•
State and municipal obligations, excluding auction rate securities
         A yield curve is generated and applied to bond sectors, and individual bond valuations are extrapolated.  Inputs used to generate the yield curve are bellwether issue levels, established trading spreads between similar issuers or credits, historical trading spreads over widely accepted market benchmarks, new issue scales, and verified bid information.  Bid information is verified by corroborating the data against external sources such as broker-dealers, trustees/paying agents, issuers, or non-affiliated bondholders.
•
Mortgage and asset-backed securities
        Collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset-backed securities are valued at the tranche level.  For each tranche valuation, the process generates predicted cash flows for the tranche, applies a market based (or benchmark) yield/spread for each tranche, and incorporates deal collateral performance and tranche level attributes to determine tranche-specific spreads to adjust the benchmark yield.  Tranche cash flows are generated from new deal files and prepayment/default assumptions. Tranche spreads are based on tranche characteristics such as average life, type, volatility, ratings, underlying collateral and performance, and prevailing market conditions. The appropriate tranche spread is applied to the corresponding benchmark, and the resulting value is used to discount the cash flows to generate an evaluated price.  
124
Table of Contents
        Valuation of agency pass-through securities, typically issued under GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, and SBA programs, are primarily derived from information from the to-be-announced (TBA) market.  This market consists of generic mortgage pools which have not been received for settlement.  Snapshots of the TBA market, using live data feeds distributed by multiple electronic platforms, are used in conjunction with other indices to compute a price based on discounted cash flow models.
•
Other debt securities
         Other debt securities are valued using active markets and inter-dealer brokers as well as option adjusted spreads.  The spreads and models use yield curves, terms and conditions of the bonds, and any special features (e.g., call or put options and redemption features).
•
Auction rate securities
 The available for sale portfolio includes certain auction rate securities.  Due to the illiquidity in the auction rate securities market in recent years, the fair value of these securities cannot be based on observable market prices.  The fair values of these securities are estimated using a discounted cash flows analysis which is discussed more fully in the Level 3 Inputs section of this note.  Because many of the inputs significant to the measurement are not observable, these measurements are classified as Level 3 measurements.  
Trading debt securities
The securities in the Company’s trading portfolio are priced by averaging several broker quotes for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2 measurements.  
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values
Equity securities are priced using the market prices for each security from the major stock exchanges or other electronic quotation systems.  These are generally classified as Level 1 measurements.  Stocks which trade infrequently are classified as Level 2.
Private equity investments
These securities are held by the Company’s private equity subsidiary and are included in other investment securities in the consolidated balance sheets. Due to the absence of quoted market prices, valuation of these nonpublic investments requires significant management judgment.  These fair value measurements, which are discussed in the Level 3 Inputs section of this note, are classified as Level 3.
Derivatives 
The Company’s derivative instruments include interest rate swaps and floors, foreign exchange forward contracts, and certain credit risk guarantee agreements. When appropriate, the impact of credit standing as well as any potential credit enhancements, such as collateral, has been considered in the fair value measurement.
•
Valuations for interest rate swaps are derived from a proprietary model whose significant inputs are readily observable market parameters, primarily yield curves used to calculate current exposure.  Counterparty credit risk is incorporated into the model and calculated by applying a net credit spread over SOFR to the swap's total expected exposure over time.  The net credit spread is comprised of spreads for both the Company and its counterparty, derived from probability of default and other loss estimate information obtained from a third party credit data provider or from the Company's Credit department when not otherwise available.  The credit risk component is not significant compared to the overall fair value of the swaps.  The results of the model are constantly validated through comparison to active trading in the marketplace.  
       Parties to swaps requiring central clearing are required to post collateral (generally in the form of cash or marketable securities) to an authorized clearing agency that holds and monitors the collateral. The Company's clearing counterparty characterizes a component of this collateral, known as variation margin, as a legal settlement of the derivative contract exposure, and as a result, the variation margin is considered in determining the fair value of the derivative.   
     Valuations for interest rate floors are also derived from a proprietary model whose significant inputs are readily observable market parameters, primarily yield curves and volatility surfaces.  The model uses market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates fall below the strike rates of the floors.  The model also incorporates credit valuation adjustments of both the Company's and the 
125
Table of Contents
counterparties' non-performance risk.  The credit valuation adjustment component is not significant compared to the overall fair value of the floors.            
        The fair value measurements of interest rate swaps and floors are classified as Level 2 due to the observable nature of the significant inputs utilized. 
•
Fair value measurements for foreign exchange contracts are derived from a model whose primary inputs are quotations from global market makers and are classified as Level 2.  
•
The Company’s contracts related to credit risk guarantees are valued under a proprietary model which uses unobservable inputs and assumptions about the creditworthiness of the counterparty (generally a Bank customer).  Customer credit spreads, which are based on probability of default and other loss estimates, are calculated internally by the Company's Credit department, as mentioned above, and are based on the Company's internal risk rating for each customer. Because these inputs are significant to the measurements, they are classified as Level 3.
•
Derivatives relating to residential mortgage loan sale activity include commitments to originate mortgage loans held for sale, forward loan sale contracts, and forward commitments to sell TBA securities.  The fair values of loan commitments and sale contracts are estimated using quoted market prices for loans similar to the underlying loans in these instruments.  The valuations of loan commitments are further adjusted to include embedded servicing value and the probability of funding. These assumptions are considered Level 3 inputs and are significant to the loan commitment valuation; accordingly, the measurement of loan commitments is classified as Level 3. The fair value measurement of TBA contracts is based on security prices published on trading platforms and is classified as Level 2.
Assets held in trust for deferred compensation plan
Assets held in a third party trust for the Company’s deferred compensation plan consist of investments in mutual funds. The fair value measurements are based on quoted prices in active markets and classified as Level 1.  The Company has recorded an asset representing the total investment amount. The Company has also recorded a corresponding liability, representing the Company’s liability to the plan participants.

* Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments.
The fair values of the Company's private equity investments are based on a determination of fair value of the investee company less preference payments assuming the sale of the investee company.  Investee companies are normally non-public entities.  The fair value of the investee company is determined by reference to the investee's total earnings before interest, depreciation/amortization, and income taxes (EBITDA) multiplied by an EBITDA factor.  EBITDA is normally determined based on a trailing prior period adjusted for specific factors including current economic outlook, investee management, and specific unique circumstances such as sales order information, major customer status, regulatory changes, etc.  The EBITDA multiple is based on management's review of published trading multiples for recent private equity transactions and other judgments and is derived for each individual investee.  The fair value of the Company's investment is then calculated based on its ownership percentage in the investee company.  On a quarterly basis, these fair value analyses are reviewed by a valuation committee consisting of investment managers and senior Company management. 
Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Valuation methods for instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
Following is a description of the Company’s valuation methodologies used for other financial and nonfinancial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  
Collateral dependent loans
While the overall loan portfolio is not carried at fair value, the Company periodically records nonrecurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of those loans.  Nonrecurring adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral dependent loans when establishing the allowance for credit losses on loans.  Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan.  In determining the value of real estate collateral, the Company relies on external and internal appraisals of property values depending on the size and complexity of the real estate collateral.  The Company maintains a staff of qualified appraisers who also review third party appraisal reports for reasonableness.  In the case of non-real estate collateral, reliance is placed on a variety of sources, including external estimates of value and judgments based on the experience and expertise of internal specialists. Values of all loan collateral are regularly reviewed by credit administration.  Unobservable inputs to these measurements, which include estimates and judgments often used in conjunction with appraisals, are not readily quantifiable.  
128
Table of Contents
These measurements are classified as Level 3.  Nonrecurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are shown in the table above.
Foreclosed assets
Foreclosed assets consist of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure. This collateral is comprised of commercial and residential real estate and other non-real estate property, including auto, marine and recreational vehicles. Foreclosed assets are recorded as held for sale initially at the lower of the loan balance or fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically, and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. Fair value measurements may be based upon appraisals, third-party price opinions, or internally developed pricing methods. These measurements are classified as Level 3.
Long-lived assets 
When investments in branch facilities and various office buildings are determined to be impaired, their carrying values are written down to estimated fair value, or estimated fair value less cost to sell if the property is held for sale.  Fair value is estimated in a process which considers current local commercial real estate market conditions and the judgment of the sales agent and often involves obtaining third party appraisals from certified real estate appraisers.  The carrying amounts of these real estate holdings are regularly monitored by real estate professionals employed by the Company. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 3.  Unobservable inputs to these measurements, which include estimates and judgments often used in conjunction with appraisals, are not readily quantifiable.

129
Table of Contents
18. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company are set forth below. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information.  They do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.  Because no market exists for many of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, risk characteristics and economic conditions.  These estimates are subjective, involve uncertainties, and cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments and the classification of their fair value measurement within the valuation hierarchy are as follows at December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Derivative Instruments
The notional amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments are shown in the table below.  These contractual amounts, along with other terms of the derivative, are used to determine amounts to be exchanged between counterparties and are not a measure of loss exposure.  The Company's derivatives are not accounted for as accounting hedges except for the interest rate floors, as discussed below.

The largest group of notional amounts relate to interest rate swap contracts sold to commercial customers who wish to modify their interest rate sensitivity. Those customers are engaged in a variety of businesses, including real estate, manufacturing, retail product distribution, education, and retirement communities. These interest rate swap contracts with customers are offset by matching interest rate swap contracts purchased by the Company from other financial institutions (dealers). Contracts with dealers that require central clearing are novated to a clearing agency who becomes the Company's counterparty.  Because of the matching terms of the offsetting contracts, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, changes in fair value subsequent to initial recognition have a minimal effect on earnings. 
Many of the Company’s interest rate swap contracts with large financial institutions contain contingent features relating to debt ratings or capitalization levels.  Under these provisions, if the Company’s debt rating falls below investment grade or if the Company ceases to be “well-capitalized” under risk-based capital guidelines, certain counterparties can require immediate and ongoing collateralization on interest rate swaps in net liability positions or instant settlement of the contracts.  The Company maintains debt ratings and capital well above those minimum requirements.     
As of December 31, 2024, the Company held four interest rate floors indexed to 1-month SOFR to hedge the risk of declining interest rates on certain floating rate commercial loans.  The floors have a combined notional value of $2.0 billion and are forward-starting.  Each of the four interest rate floors has a six-year term and a notional amount of $500 million.  In the event that the index rate falls below zero, the maximum rate that the Company can earn on the notional amount of each floor is limited to the strike rate
.  
Information about the floors is provided in the table below.

The premium paid for the floors totaled $
90.2
 million, and at December 31, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to lower rates is approximately 
6.5
 years.  These interest rate floors qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. The change in the fair value of these interest rate floors is recorded in AOCI, net of the amortization of the premiums paid, which is recorded against interest and fees on loans in the consolidated statements of income.  As of December 31, 2024, net deferred losses on the interest rate floors totaled $
34.4
 million (pre-tax) and were recorded in AOCI in the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, it is expected that $
11.2
 million (pre-tax) interest rate floor premium amortization will be reclassified from AOCI into earnings over the next 12 months for the outstanding interest rate floors.

Table of Contents
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company monetized three interest rate floors that were previously classified as cash flow hedges with a combined notional balance of $
1.5
 billion and an asset fair value of $
163.2
 million.  As of December 31, 2024, the total realized gains on the monetized cash flow hedges remaining in AOCI was $
29.2
 million (pre-tax), which will be reclassified into interest income over the next 
2.0
 years. The estimated amount of net gains remaining in AOCI related to the monetized cash flow hedges at December 31, 2024 that is expected to be reclassified into income within the next 12 months is $
20.3
 million.
The Company also contracts with other financial institutions, as a guarantor or beneficiary, to share credit risk associated with certain interest rate swaps through risk participation agreements.  The Company’s risks and responsibilities as guarantor are further discussed in Note 21 on Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.  In addition, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts, which are mainly comprised of contracts with customers to purchase or deliver specific foreign currencies at specific future dates.

Under its program to sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, the Company designates certain newly-originated residential mortgage loans as held for sale.  Derivative instruments arising from this activity include mortgage loan commitments and forward loan sale contracts.  Changes in the fair values of the loan commitments and funded loans prior to sale that are due to changes in interest rates are economically hedged with forward contracts to sell residential mortgage-backed securities in the to-be-announced (TBA) market.  These forward TBA contracts are also considered to be derivatives and are settled in cash at the security settlement date. 
The fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments, whose notional amounts are listed above, are shown in the table below. Information about the valuation methods used to determine fair value is provided in Note 17 on Fair Value Measurements. As stated in the summary of significant accounting policies, derivative instruments and their related gains and losses are presented as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
The Company's policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in its consolidated balance sheets, and these are reported in other assets and other liabilities.  In prior years, certain collateral posted to and from the Company's clearing counterparty has been applied to the fair values of the cleared swap.  There was 
no
 reduction to positive or negative fair values of cleared swaps at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Company made an election to exclude the initial premiums paid on the interest rate floors from the hedge effectiveness measurement. Those initial premiums are amortized over the periods between the premium payment month and the contract maturity month. The pre-tax effects of the gains and losses (both the included and excluded amounts for hedge effectiveness assessment) recognized in the other comprehensive income from the cash flow hedging instruments and the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income (both included and excluded amounts for hedge effectiveness measurement) are shown in the table below.

The following table shows the extent to which assets and liabilities relating to derivative instruments have been offset in the consolidated balance sheets.  It also provides information about these instruments which are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, irrespective of whether they are offset, and the extent to which the instruments could potentially be offset.  Also shown is collateral received or pledged in the form of other financial instruments, which is generally cash or marketable securities.  The collateral amounts in this table are limited to the outstanding balances of the related asset or liability (after netting is applied); thus amounts of excess collateral are not shown.  Most of the derivatives in the following table were transacted under master netting arrangements that contain a conditional right of offset, such as close-out netting, upon default.
134
Table of Contents
While the Company is party to master netting arrangements with most of its swap counterparties, the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities under these arrangements on its consolidated balance sheets.  Collateral exchanged between the Company and dealer bank counterparties is generally subject to thresholds and transfer minimums, and usually consist of marketable securities.  By contract, this collateral may be sold or re-pledged by the secured party until recalled at a subsequent valuation date by the pledging party.  For those swap transactions requiring central clearing, the Company posts cash or securities to its clearing agent.  Collateral positions are valued daily, and adjustments to amounts received and pledged by the Company are made as appropriate to maintain proper collateralization for these transactions.  Swap derivative transactions with customers are generally secured by rights to non-financial collateral, such as real and personal property, which is not shown in the table below.

Resale and Repurchase Agreements
The Company regularly enters into resale and repurchase agreement transactions with other financial institutions and with its own customers. Resale and repurchase agreements are agreements to purchase/sell securities subject to an obligation to resell/repurchase the same or similar securities.  They are accounted for as secured lending and collateralized borrowing (e.g. financing transactions), not as true sales and purchases of the underlying collateral securities.  Some of the resale and repurchase agreements were transacted under master netting arrangements that contain a conditional right of offset, such as close-out netting, upon default. The security collateral accepted or pledged in resale and repurchase agreements with other financial institutions may be sold or re-pledged by the secured party, but is usually delivered to and held by third party trustees. The Company generally retains custody of securities pledged for repurchase agreements with its customers.  Additional information about the Company's repurchase agreements is included in Note 8.
The following table shows the extent to which resale agreement assets and repurchase agreement liabilities with the same counterparty have been offset on the consolidated balance sheets, in addition to the extent to which they could potentially be offset.  Also shown is collateral received or pledged, which consists of marketable securities.  The collateral amounts in the

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees    
The Company engages in various transactions and commitments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet customer financing needs.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making the commitments and conditional obligations described below as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  
The following table summarizes these commitments at December 31:

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a borrower providing there are no violations of any conditions established in the contract.  As many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  Refer to Note 2 on Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for further discussion.
The Company, as a provider of financial services, routinely issues financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit.  Standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the Company generally to guarantee the payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party.  While these represent a potential cash outflow by the Company, a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon. To mitigate the potential loss exposure, the Company involves other financial institutions to participate in certain standby letters of credit. Even with such participation, the Company remains liable for the full amount of the standby letters of credit to the third party.  The Company has recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit.  The standby letters of credit are subject to the same credit policies, underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by the Company.  Most of the standby letters of credit are secured, and in the event of nonperformance by the customer, the Company has rights to the underlying collateral, which could include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had recorded a liability of $
3.5
 million, representing the carrying value of the guarantee obligations associated with the standby letters of credit.  This amount will be accreted into income over the remaining life of the respective commitments.  The contractual amount of these letters of credit, which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company, was $
585.1
 million at December 31, 2024.
Commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer.  The majority of commercial letters of credit issued are used to settle payments in international trade.  Typically, letters of credit require presentation of documents which describe the commercial transaction, evidence shipment, and transfer title.
The Company regularly purchases various state tax credits arising from third-party property redevelopment.  These tax credits are either resold to third parties for a profit or retained for use by the Company.  During 2024, the Company purchased and sold state tax credits amounting to $
123.9
 million and $
127.6
 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments totaling $
215.3
 million that it expects to fund in 2025. The remaining purchase commitments amount to $
432.1
 million and are expected to be funded from 2026 through 2035. 
The Company periodically enters into credit risk participation agreements (RPAs) as a guarantor to other financial institutions, in order to mitigate those institutions’ credit risk associated with interest rate swaps with third parties.  The RPA stipulates that, in the event of default by the third party on the interest rate swap, the Company will reimburse a portion of the loss borne by the financial institution.  These interest rate swaps are normally collateralized (generally with real property, inventories and equipment) by the third party, which limits the credit risk associated with the Company’s RPAs.  The third parties usually have other borrowing relationships with the Company.  The Company monitors overall borrower collateral, and at December 31, 2024, believes sufficient collateral is available to cover potential swap losses. The RPAs are carried at fair value throughout their term, with all changes in fair value, including those due to a change in the third party’s creditworthiness, recorded in current earnings.  The terms of the RPAs, which correspond to the terms of the underlying swaps, range from 
1
 to 
12
 years.  At December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Company's guarantee liability RPAs was $
58
 thousand, and the notional 
137

amount of the underlying swaps was $
320.4
 million.  The maximum potential future payment guaranteed by the Company cannot be readily estimated and is dependent upon the fair value of the interest rate swaps at the time of default.
The Company has various legal proceedings pending at December 31, 2024, arising in the normal course of business. While some matters pending against the Company specify damages claimed by plaintiffs, others do not seek a specified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. The Company records a loss accrual for all legal and regulatory matters for which it deems a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Some matters, which are in the early stages, have not yet progressed to the point where a loss amount can be determined to be probable and estimable.

Tower has a $
13.5
 million line of credit with the Bank which is subject to normal credit terms and has a variable interest rate.   The line of credit is collateralized by Company stock and based on collateral value had a maximum borrowing amount of approximately $
13.5
 million at December 31, 2024.  There were 
no
 borrowings under this line during 2024, and 
no
 balance was outstanding at December 31, 2024.  There were 
no
 borrowings during 2023 and 2022, and there was 
no
 balance outstanding at December 31, 2023 or 2022.  Letters of credit may be collateralized under this line of credit; however, there were 
no
 letters of credit outstanding during 2024, 2023 or 2022, and thus, 
no
 fees were received during these periods.  From time to time, the Bank extends additional credit to Tower for construction and development projects.  
No
 construction loans were outstanding during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Tower leased office space in the Kansas City bank headquarters building owned by the Company during 2022, 2023, and 2024.  Rent paid to the Company totaled $
81
 thousand in 2024, $
82

 and $

 per square foot, for years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  Tower was no longer a lessee of the Company as of January 1, 2025.
Directors of the Company and their beneficial interests have deposit accounts with the Bank and may be provided with cash management and other banking services, including loans, in the ordinary course of business.  Such loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other unrelated persons and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. See Note 2 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information for loans to directors and executive officers of the Company and the Bank, and to their affiliates.

Dividends paid by the Parent to its shareholders were substantially provided from Bank dividends.  The Bank may distribute common dividends without prior regulatory approval, provided that the dividends do not exceed the sum of net income for the current year and retained net income for the preceding two years, subject to maintenance of minimum capital requirements.  The Parent charges fees to its subsidiaries for management services provided, which are allocated to the subsidiaries based primarily on total average assets.  The Parent makes cash advances to its private equity subsidiary for general short-term cash flow purposes.  Advances may be made to the Parent by its subsidiary bank for temporary investment of idle funds.  Interest on such advances is based on market rates.
The Bank has $
50.0
 million of borrowings from the Parent as part of its strategy to manage FDIC insurance premiums.  The note has a rolling 13 month maturity, and the interest rate is a variable rate equal to the one year treasury rate. 
For the past several years, the Parent has maintained a $
20.0
 million line of credit for general corporate purposes with the Bank.  The Parent has 
not
 borrowed under this line during the past three years.  
The Parent has commitments to fund an additional $
50.8
 million relating to private equity investments over the next several years.  The investments are made directly by the Parent and through non-bank subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2024, the fair value of the investment securities held by the Parent consisted of investments of $
5.4
 million in corporate bonds, $
5.7
 million in preferred and common stock with readily determinable fair values, and $
7.0
 million in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.  The Parent also holds 
411,723
 shares of Visa Class B-2 common stock, which are discussed in Note 3.  During 2024, the Parent sold Visa Class A common stock resulting in proceeds of $
176.6
 million, also discussed in Note 3.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation under the framework in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013),

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Commerce Bancshares, Inc.: 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Commerce Bancshares, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
