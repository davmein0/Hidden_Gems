PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “IRDM.” As of February 7, 2025, there were 130 holders of record of our common stock.
Dividends
Stockholders are entitled to receive, when and if declared by our Board of Directors from time to time, dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property from our assets or funds legally and contractually available for such purposes. In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock, which was paid on March 29 to stockholders of record as of March 15. In May 2024, August 2024 and December 2024, our Board of Directors approved dividends of $0.14 per share of common stock, which were paid on June 28, September 30 and December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of June 14, September 13 and December 16, 2024, respectively. We made total dividend payments of $
64.7
 million during 2024. Our liability related to dividends on common stock was $
2.5
 million and $
1.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We currently expect that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future, although future dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Board. The Board of Directors plans to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share starting with the third quarter 2025 dividend.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024.
Overview of Our Business
We are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites. We are the only commercial provider of communications services offering true global coverage, connecting people, organizations and assets to and from anywhere, in real time. Our low-earth orbit, L-band satellite network provides reliable, weather-resilient communications services to regions of the world where terrestrial wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are limited, including remote land areas, open ocean, airways, the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters.
We provide voice and data communications services to businesses, the U.S. and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers via our satellite network, which has an architecture of 66 operational satellites with in-orbit spares and related ground infrastructure. We utilize an interlinked mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks between satellites. This unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation, which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence. 
In 2024, we acquired Satelles, Inc., or Satelles, a provider of highly secure, satellite-based position, navigation and timing (PNT) services that complement and protect GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite System, or GNSS, reliant systems. Time synchronization and location data play an important role in the global economy, particularly for major industries supported by critical infrastructure, such as financial services, telecommunications, cyber-security and transportation. We believe the acquisition of Satelles’s business could generate substantial growth in our service revenue, as well as incremental equipment and engineering services revenue over the coming years from both government and commercial customers. See 
Note 12
 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. 
44
We sell our products and services to commercial end users through a wholesale distribution network, encompassing approximately 110 service providers, 310 value-added resellers, or VARs, and 85 value-added manufacturers, or VAMs, who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers, VARs or dealers. These distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications for our products and services targeting specific lines of business.
At December 31, 2024, we had approximately 2,460,000 billable subscribers worldwide, an increase of 181,000, or 8%, from approximately 2,279,000 billable subscribers at December 31, 2023. We have a diverse customer base, including end users in land-mobile, Internet of Things, or IoT, maritime, aviation and government.
We recognize revenue primarily from the provision of services and the sale of equipment. Service revenue represented 74% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Voice and data, IoT data and broadband service revenues have historically generated higher margins than subscriber equipment revenue, and we expect this trend to continue. We also recognize revenue from our hosted payloads, principally from Aireon, including fees for hosting the payloads and fees for transmitting data from the payloads over our network, as well as revenue from other services, such as satellite time and location services.
Term Loan and Revolving Facility
On September 20, 2023, pursuant to a credit agreement (or, as amended to date, the Credit Agreement), we refinanced our previously existing term loan resulting in borrowing of $1,500.0 million, or the Term Loan, issued at a price equal to 99.75%, and an accompanying $100.0 million revolving loan, or the Revolving Facility. The maturity date of the Term Loan is in September 2030. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we borrowed an additional $325.0 million under our Term Loan, comprised of $125.0 million on March 25, 2024 and $200.0 million on July 30, 2024. The additional amounts borrowed are fungible with the original $1,500.0 million, and have the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms. The additional $125.0 million was issued at a price equal to 99.875% of its face value, while the additional $200.0 million was issued at a price equal to 99.0% of its face value. 
The proceeds from the March 2024 additional Term Loan were used for the acquisition of Satelles on April 1, 2024. In April 2024, we drew down $50.0 million on our Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes, including the funding of repurchases of our common stock. This amount was repaid with the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024, and there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024. The remaining proceeds from the July 2024 additional Term Loan have been used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. 
The Term Loan has been repriced on several occasions, most recently in June 2024, and currently bears interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus 2.25%, with a 0.75% SOFR floor. We typically select a one-month interest period, with the result that interest is calculated using one-month SOFR. Interest is paid monthly on the last business day of the month. Principal payments, payable quarterly, equal $18.3 million per annum, which is one percent of the full principal amount of the Term Loan, with the remaining principal due upon maturity. 
The Revolving Facility bears interest at an annual rate of SOFR plus 2.25% (but without a SOFR floor) if and as drawn, with no original issue discount, a commitment fee of 0.5% per year on the undrawn amount, which is reduced to 0.375% if we have a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of less than 3.5 to 1. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date in September 2028. See 
Note 6
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion of our Term Loan and Revolving Facility.
As of December 31, 2024, we reported an aggregate balance of $1,807.7 million in borrowings under the Term Loan, before $16.9 million of net deferred financing costs, for a net principal balance of $1,790.9 million outstanding in our consolidated balance sheet. Our Revolving Facility was undrawn as of December 31, 2024. 
Our Term Loan contains no financial maintenance covenants. With respect to the Revolving Facility, we are required to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of no greater than 6.25 to 1 if more than 35% of the Revolving Facility has been drawn, or subject to letter of credit exposure. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate exposure under the Revolving Facility was less than 35%. The Credit Agreement contains other customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. 
The Credit Agreement restricts our ability to incur liens, engage in mergers or asset sales, pay dividends, repay subordinated indebtedness, incur indebtedness, make investments and loans, and engage in other transactions as specified in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for specified exceptions, including baskets measured as a percentage of trailing 
45
twelve months of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and unlimited exceptions in the case of incurring indebtedness and liens and making investments, dividend payments, and payments of subordinated indebtedness, based on achievement and maintenance of specified leverage ratios. The Credit Agreement permits repayment, prepayment, and repricing transactions, subject, in the case of the Term Loan, to a 1% penalty in the event the Term Loan is prepaid or repriced within the first six months from the refinancing date. The Credit Agreement also contains a mandatory prepayment sweep mechanism with respect to a portion of our excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the event our consolidated first lien net leverage ratio rises above 3.5 to 1. Our mandatory excess cash flow prepayment, as specified in the Credit Agreement, was $28.6 million as of December 31, 2024. This amount is scheduled to be paid in 2025 and will be applied towards our required quarterly principal payments. As such, it was classified under current short-term secured debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. The Credit Agreement permits repayment, prepayment, and repricing transactions. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
Derivative Financial Instruments
In July 2021, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement, or the Cap, that began in December 2021. The Cap manages our exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of the Term Loan through November 2026. The Cap, which was not affected by the refinancing of the Term Loan in September 2023 or the 2024 increases and repricing, is designed to mirror the terms of the Term Loan and to offset the cash flows being hedged. We designated the Cap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the SOFR-based interest payments on the Term Loan. The effective portion of the Cap’s change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
The Cap provides us the right to receive payment from the counterparty if one-month SOFR exceeds 1.436%. We began paying a fixed monthly premium based on an annual rate of 0.31% for the Cap in December 2021. The Cap carried a notional amount of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
See 
Note 7
 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments.
Total Interest on Debt and Loss on Extinguishment
Total interest incurred includes amortization of deferred financing fees and capitalized interest. We incurred third-party financing costs of $2.3 million in connection with the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024, $1.9 million related to the repricing of the Term Loan in June 2024 and $1.6 million in connection with the expansion of the Term Loan in March 2024, substantially all of which we expensed as incurred. Due to the refinancing of the Term Loan in 2023, we incurred third-party financing costs of $15.9 million, of which $14.7 million was expensed. These costs are included within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
Total interest incurred during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $102.8 million, $102.3 million and $72.1 million, respectively. Interest incurred includes amortization of deferred financing fees of $2.7 million, $4.0 million and $4.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $5.0 million, $5.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest on the Term Loan was $0.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. 
Material Trends and Uncertainties

Our industry and customer base have historically grown as a result of:
•
demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services;
•
a growing number of new products and services and related applications;
•
a broad wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets;
•
increased demand for communications services by disaster and relief agencies and emergency first responders;
•
improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings;
•
regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services;
•
a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services and subscriber equipment; and
46
•
geographic market expansion through the ability to offer our services in additional countries.
Nonetheless, we face a number of challenges and uncertainties in operating our business, including:
•
our ability to maintain the health, capacity, control and level of service of our satellites; 
•
our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products and services;
•
changes in general economic, business and industry conditions, including the effects of currency exchange rates;
•
our reliance on a single primary commercial gateway and a primary satellite network operations center;
•
competition from other mobile satellite service providers and, to a lesser extent, from the expansion of terrestrial-based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures;
•
market acceptance of our products;
•
regulatory requirements in existing and new geographic markets;
•
challenges associated with global operations, including as a result of conflicts in or affecting markets in which we operate;
•
rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry;
•
our ability to generate sufficient internal cash flows to repay our debt;
•
reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products, services and applications effectively;
•
reliance on a global supply chain, including single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of our subscriber equipment and for some of the components required in the manufacture of our end-user subscriber equipment and our ability to purchase component parts that are periodically subject to shortages resulting from surges in demand, natural disasters or other events, including a global pandemic, such as COVID-19; and
•
reliance on a few significant customers, particularly agencies of the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our revenue, as a result of which the loss or decline in business with any of these customers may negatively impact our revenue and collectability of related accounts receivable.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, useful lives of property and equipment, loss contingencies, and other estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below. Our accounting policies are more fully described in 
Note 2
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Income Taxes 
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This approach requires that we recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based upon enacted tax rates for the period in which the deferred tax items are expected to
reverse. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in various jurisdictions are reflected in the period of change. Significant judgment is
required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resulting tax liabilities as well as our ability to realize our deferred tax
assets. Our estimates of future taxable income and any changes to such estimates can significantly impact our tax provision in a
given period. Significant judgment is required in determining our ability to realize our deferred tax assets related to federal,
state and foreign tax attributes within their carryforward periods including estimating the amount and timing of the future
reversal of deferred tax items in our projections of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize in the future. We also recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax
positions only when we estimate that it is “more likely than not” that the position will be sustainable based on its technical
merits. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, this may result in material changes to our income
tax provision.
47
Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. We apply judgment in determining the useful lives based on factors such as engineering data, our long-term strategy for using the assets, the manufacturer’s estimated design life for the assets, laws and regulations that could impact the useful lives of the assets and other economic factors. In evaluating the useful lives of our satellites, we assess the current estimated operational life of the satellites, including the potential impact of environmental factors on the satellites, ongoing operational enhancements and software upgrades. Additionally, we review engineering data relating to the operation and performance of our satellite network.

We depreciate our satellites over the shorter of their potential operational life or the period of their expected use. The appropriateness of the useful lives is evaluated on a quarterly basis or as events occur that require additional assessment. The upgraded satellites that have been placed into service are depreciated using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. If the estimated useful lives of our upgraded satellites change, it could have a material impact on the timing of the recognition of depreciation expense and hosted payload revenue. 
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we updated our estimate of the satellites’ remaining useful lives based on the health of the constellation, resulting in an extension from 12.5 years to 17.5 years. If our actual operational results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, however, we may experience further changes in depreciation and amortization expense that could be material to our results of operations. See 
Note 2
 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further detail on the impact of this change.

Commercial broadband consists of Iridium OpenPort and Iridium Certus broadband services.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, total commercial service revenue increased $30.2 million, or 6%, primarily as a result of increases in IoT and voice and data services revenue. Commercial IoT revenue increased $25.2 million, or 18%, compared to the prior year, driven by a 10% increase in IoT billable subscribers primarily in users of personal communications devices, and a new contract with a large customer executed in the first quarter of 2024. Commercial voice and data revenue increased $6.9 million, or 3%, from the prior year primarily due to an increase in billable subscribers. Commercial broadband revenue decreased $1.8 million, or 3%, compared to the prior year, due to a decrease in ARPU reflecting the increased prevalence of usage of our service as a companion service. Hosted payload and other service revenue decreased $0.1 million, reflecting the quarterly year-over-year decrease due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites made in the fourth quarter of 2023, offset in part by increases in other data service revenue including Satelles revenue.

Subscriber equipment revenue decreased $13.7 million, or 13%, to $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the volume of handset sales, offset in part by an increase in Short Burst Data sales. The overall decrease was is in line with our previously announced expectations, as we returned to more normal levels after the supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic. We expect equipment revenue in 2025 to be in line with 2024.

Engineering and support service revenue increased by $23.2 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to the increased work under certain government projects, predominantly the contract awarded by the Space Development Agency, or the SDA, offset in part by decreases in commercial engineering projects. We expect engineering and support service revenue to be higher in 2025 than in 2024.

Operating Expenses

Cost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)

Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of network engineering and operations staff, including contractors, software maintenance, product support services, and cost of services for government and commercial engineering and support service revenue.

Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $19.4 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of increased work under certain government projects, including the SDA contract, as noted above. 
Cost of Subscriber Equipment
Cost of subscriber equipment includes the direct costs of equipment sold, which consist of manufacturing costs, allocation of overhead, and warranty costs.
Cost of subscriber equipment decreased $14.0 million, or 21%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the decrease in volume of device sales, as described above, and decreased inventory component costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased by $8.2 million, or 40%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period based on increased spending by Satelles since its acquisition and other device-related features for our network, including Project Stardust, which is our multi-year project to develop Iridium NTN DirectSM, our standards-based Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN) messaging and SOS capabilities for smartphones, tablets, cars and related consumer applications.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses that are not directly attributable to the sale of services or products include sales and marketing costs as well as employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, and benefits), legal, finance, information technology, facilities, billing and customer care expenses.
51
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $24.5 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to personnel costs from increased headcount and related costs, including higher employee stock-based compensation expense, increased expense from Satelles and related acquisition costs and certain costs that were previously recorded in cost of services, offset in part by a decrease in regulatory fees, decreased spending related to our channel partner conference which was held in the first quarter of the prior year and a decrease in stock appreciation rights expense in the current year resulting from a decrease in our stock valuation between the years. 
Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $116.9 million, or 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the change in estimated useful lives of our satellites during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the write-off of our final ground spare, that resulted in accelerated depreciation of $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2023. We expect that depreciation expense will generally remain in line with 2024 depreciation expense for the remainder of the estimated useful lives.

Other Expense
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $91.1 million, compared to $90.4 million for the prior year. Interest expense, net in the current year reflects the higher average outstanding debt balance, offset in part by a $9.1 million decrease in repricing fees and the reduced interest rate in the current year. 
Other Income, net
Other income, net, was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $4.0 million for the prior year. The prior year balance was primarily the result of a one-time customer contractual settlement which resulted in recognition of $3.5 million of other income in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

For the year ended December 31, 2024, our income tax expense was $12.3 million, compared to income tax benefit of

$26.3 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 553.0% for the prior year. The decrease in income tax benefit is primarily related to the net impact of (i) pre-tax book income in the current year compared to pre-tax book loss in the prior year, (ii) a decrease in estimated R&D credits, (iii) an increased stock compensation tax expense, and (iv) a tax benefit for the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction. If our current estimates change in future periods, the impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities may change correspondingly. See 
Note 13
 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the individual items impacting our effective tax rate for the years.
Gain (Loss) on Equity Method Investments
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our gain on equity method investments was $15.3 million, compared to a loss of $6.1 million in the prior year. The gain in 2024 primarily reflects the acquisition of Satelles, as we recorded a $19.8 million gain on our pre-acquisition equity method investment in Satelles, offset in part by the portion of losses recorded on other equity method investments. The prior year reflects the portion of losses recorded on equity method investments, including Satelles, during the period.
Net Income 

Net income was $112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $15.4 million during the prior year. The improvement primarily resulted from the decrease in depreciation expense, an increase in revenues, and the gain on equity method investments, as noted above, offset in part by an increase in income taxes and an increase in operating expenses other than depreciation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations, cash and cash equivalents and our Revolving Facility. At December 31, 2024, we had $1.8 billion of indebtedness, consisting exclusively of amounts outstanding under the Term Loan, 
52
the terms of which are described above under the section captioned “Term Loan.” We have additional borrowing available to us under our Revolving Facility of $100.0 million at December 31, 2024. These sources are expected to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, including annual payments for (i) required principal and interest on the Term Loan, which we expect to be $33.1 million inclusive of the mandatory excess cash flow prepayment in 2025, and, based on the current interest rate, approximately $96.0 million, respectively, (ii) capital expenditures, of approximately $90.0 million in 2025 and moderating through the end of the decade, (iii) working capital, (iv) potential share repurchases, and (v) anticipated cash dividend payments to holders of our common stock. 
As of December 31, 2024, our total cash and cash equivalents balance was $93.5 million, up from $71.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was principally the result of additional Term Loan borrowings in 2024, offset in part by an increase in share repurchases. 
Contractual Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, we held non-cancelable purchase obligations of approximately $9.3 million for inventory purchases with Benchmark, our primary third-party equipment supplier. Our purchase obligations, all of which are due during 2025, decreased $12.2 million from the end of 2023 primarily due to recovery from supply chain constraints.
Our material long-term cash requirement is the repayment of the remaining principal amount under the Term Loan upon its maturity in 2030, which is expected to be $1,702.8 million. We expect to refinance this amount at or prior to maturity.
Dividends
On December 8, 2022, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend. For each quarter through March 2024, our Board of Directors declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.13 per share of common stock. Beginning in June 2024, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share of common stock for each quarter through December 2024. Total dividends paid in 2024 were $64.7 million, while total dividends in 2023 were $64.8 million. While we expect to continue the regular cash dividend program, any future dividends declared will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other factors, upon our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, as well as such other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $61.0 million from the prior year. Cash flows related to changes in working capital increased by approximately $58.7 million, primarily as a result of changes in inventory, offset by corresponding decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. In 2023, we replenished finished goods and component inventory, including last time buys. These changes were partially offset by net income, as adjusted for non-cash activities, which decreased by $2.4 million over the prior year. Net income in 2023 was adjusted for non-cash, positive adjustments, including depreciation expense associated with the write-off of the remaining spare satellite in the third quarter, and stock-based compensation expense. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $97.1 million from the prior year period primarily as a result of our acquisition of Satelles on April 1, 2024, offset in part by a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. We expect our capital expenditures to be $90.0 million in 2025 and moderate through the end of the decade.

53
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $156.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the additional $325.0 million in borrowings under the Term Loan, offset in part by increased repurchases of our common stock.
Seasonality
Our results of operations have been subject to seasonal usage changes for commercial customers, and we expect that our results will be affected by similar seasonality going forward. March through October are typically the peak months for commercial voice services revenue and related subscriber equipment sales. In December 2024, a large IoT customer began to phase out its annual retail pricing plans. As a result, that customer’s annual billable subscribers will move to monthly plans, which we expect to increase seasonality in billable subscribers. We expect revenue to remain unaffected due to the fixed-price nature of our contract with this customer for 2025. U.S. government revenue and commercial IoT revenue have been less subject to seasonal usage changes.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We had an outstanding aggregate balance of $
1,807.7
 million under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2024. Under our Term Loan, we pay interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus 2.25%, with a 0.75% SOFR floor. Accordingly, we have been and continue to be subject to interest rate fluctuations. Our Cap began in December 2021, which manages our exposure to interest rate movements on a notional amount of $1.0 billion of our Term Loan. In 2024, the Cap provided the right for us to receive payment from the counterparty if one-month SOFR exceeded 1.436%. (See 
Note 7
 to the financial statements included in this report for further details on the changes to the Cap.) The interest rate was above the level of the Cap for the full year 2024. For every SOFR increase of 25 basis points above the level of the Cap, we expect our annual interest expense to increase by an additional $2.0 million related to the unhedged portion of the Term Loan.
As of December 31, 2024, our Revolving Facility was undrawn. Accordingly, although the Revolving Facility bears interest at SOFR plus 2.25%, without a SOFR floor, if and as drawn, we are not currently exposed to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to our Revolving Facility.
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, as well as accounts receivable. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings and at times maintain the balance of our deposits in excess of federally insured limits. The majority of our cash is swept nightly into a money market fund invested in U.S. treasuries, agency mortgage backed securities and/or U.S. government guaranteed debt. Accounts receivable are due from both domestic and international customers. We perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and record reserves to provide for estimated credit losses. Accounts payable are owed to both domestic and international vendors.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
Iridium Communications Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iridium Communications Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Changes in estimated useful lives of satellites
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s satellites are depreciated using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives, which are currently estimated to be 17.5 years. The Company applied judgment in determining the useful lives based on factors such as engineering data relating to the operation and performance of its satellite network, the Company’s long-term strategy for using the assets, and the manufacturer’s estimated design life for the assets. As discussed in Note 4, as of December 31, 2024, the Company had recorded $1,791,730 thousand in total depreciable property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, which included its satellites.
We identified the evaluation of the determination of changes in estimated useful lives of satellites as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimated useful lives of the satellites. Specifically, assessing the factors used to determine the estimated useful lives required subjective auditor 
56
judgment due to the degree of uncertainty associated with the outcome of uncertain future events which required forward looking assumptions. Changes to the estimated useful lives of satellites could have a significant impact on the timing of recognition of depreciation expense and hosted payload revenue.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the Company’s process to determine changes in the estimated useful lives of its satellites. We evaluated the factors the Company used to determine the estimated useful lives of the satellites by:
•
comparing the Company’s useful life estimates to the manufacturer’s estimated design life, the Company’s longevity assessment for the satellites, and the lives of its first-generation satellite constellation 
•
reading publicly available information on the estimated useful lives of similar assets
•
inquiring of operations and engineering management personnel regarding satellite operation and performance
•
evaluating the effect of changes, if any, in the Company’s long-term strategy for use of the assets on the useful life estimates. 
Evaluation of acquisition-date fair value of customer relationships
As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 1, 2024, the Company acquired the remaining 80.5% of the outstanding shares and voting interest of Satelles, Inc. that was not previously owned by the Company for consideration totaling $125.5 million. The Company accounted for the acquired business using the acquisition method of accounting by recording assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. As part of the transaction, the Company acquired customer relationship intangible assets with an acquisition date fair value of $57 million, which was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method.
We identified the evaluation of the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in the Satelles, Inc. transaction as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was involved in evaluating certain assumptions, including the forecasted revenue growth, forecasted revenue attributable to customer contracts, forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins, and the discount rate used to value the customer relationships. Changes in these assumptions used could have a significant impact on the acquisition-date fair value of this intangible asset.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition-date valuation process, including controls over the assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the forecasted revenue growth, forecasted revenue attributable to customer contracts, and EBITDA margins used to value the customer relationships by comparing them to those of the Company’s peers and Satelles Inc.’s historical and forecasted results. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s discount rate used to value the customer relationships by comparing the Company’s inputs to the discount rate to publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rate.

Iridium Communications Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2024

1. 
Organization and Business
Iridium Communications Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, offers voice and data communications services and products to businesses, U.S. and international government agencies and other customers on a global basis. The Company is a provider of mobile voice and data communications services via a constellation of low earth orbiting satellites. The Company holds various licenses and authorizations from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) and from international and foreign regulatory bodies that permit the Company to conduct its business, including the operation of its satellite constellation.
The Company’s operations are conducted through, and its operating assets are owned by, its principal operating subsidiary, Iridium Satellite LLC

(“Iridium Satellite”), Iridium Satellite’s immediate parent, Iridium Holdings LLC, and their subsidiaries. As a result, there are no material differences between the information presented in these consolidated financial statements of the Company and the financial information of Iridium Holdings, Iridium Satellite and their subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, other than as a result of tax provisions as a result of Iridium Holdings, Iridium Satellite and their subsidiaries being classified as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
2. 
Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Company has prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of (i) the Company, (ii) its wholly owned subsidiaries, and (iii) all less than wholly owned subsidiaries that the Company controls. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company has reclassified certain items in the consolidated financial statements for the prior periods to be comparable with the classification for the year ended December 31, 2024. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, the useful lives and recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, the incremental borrowing rate for its leases, and contingencies, among others. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and recorded revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Adopted and 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). This guidance improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2023-07, as required, the effects of which are presented in 
Note 
16
.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The Company intends to apply the new guidance effective for the year ending December 31, 2025, as required. The Company is currently evaluating the effect ASU 2023-09 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
62
Fair Value Measurements
The Company evaluates assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring and non-recurring basis to determine the appropriate level to classify them for each reporting period. Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability assuming an orderly transaction in the most advantageous market at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in measuring fair value.
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following tiers:
•
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
•
Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The fair value estimates are based upon certain market assumptions and information available to the Company. The carrying values of the following financial instruments approximated their fair values as of December 31, 2024 and 2023: cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Fair values approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. The Level 2 cash equivalents include money market funds, commercial paper and short-term U.S. agency securities. The Company also classifies its derivative financial instruments as Level 2. In determining fair value of Level 2 assets, the Company uses a market approach utilizing valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields and quoted prices for similar assets.
Leases
For new leases, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases are included as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets within other assets and ROU liabilities within accrued expenses and other liabilities and within other long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. 
ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Certain leases contain variable contractual obligations as a result of future base rate escalations which are estimated based on observed trends and included within the measurement of present value. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain leases, such as teleport network facilities, the Company elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Taxes assessed on leases in which the Company is either a lessor or lessee are excluded from contract consideration and variable payments when measuring new lease contracts or remeasuring existing lease contracts.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and receivables. The majority of cash is invested into a money market fund with U.S. treasuries, agency mortgage-backed securities and/or U.S. government guaranteed debt. While the Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings, it often maintains those deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and records reserves to provide for estimated credit losses. Accounts receivable are due from both domestic and international customers.
63
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. These investments, along with cash deposited in institutional money market funds, regular interest bearing depository accounts and non-interest bearing depository accounts, are classified as cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Investments
Investments where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in Equity Method Investments on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Significant influence typically exists if the Company has a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Under this method of accounting, the Company’s share of the net earnings (losses) of the investee is included in loss on equity method investments on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Investments where the Company has less than 20% ownership interest in the investee and lacks the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under ASC 321-10-35, Investments - Equity Securities. Under this topic, the Company’s investment equals its cost, less impairment, if any. For investments without a readily determinable fair value, the Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine if any impairment indicator is present. If an indicator is present, the Company determines whether fair value was less than the investment’s carrying value. If the fair value is less than its carrying value or if there is an observable price change through a similar security from the same issuer, the Company would record an impairment charge.
Accounts Receivable
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are subject to late fee penalties. Management develops its estimate of an allowance for uncollectible receivables based on the Company’s experience with specific customers, aging of outstanding invoices, its understanding of customers’ current economic circumstances and its own judgment as to the likelihood that the Company will ultimately receive payment. The Company writes off its accounts receivable when balances ultimately are deemed uncollectible.

The allowance for doubtful accounts was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Foreign Currencies
Generally, the functional currency of the Company’s foreign consolidated subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains or losses are classified as other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). In instances where the financial statements of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy are material, they are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. In these instances, the financial statements of those entities are remeasured into the reporting currency. A highly inflationary economy is one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 
100
% or more over a three-year period.

Deferred Financing Costs
Direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with securing debt financing are deferred and are amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt.

Capitalized Interest
During the development and construction periods of a project, such as the financing of the Company’s current satellite constellation, the Company capitalizes interest. Capitalization ceases when the asset is ready for its intended use or when these activities are substantially suspended. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, the Company ceases capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continues to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project.

64
Inventory
Inventory consists primarily of finished goods, although the Company also maintains an inventory of raw materials from third-party manufacturers. The Company outsources manufacturing of subscriber equipment to a third-party manufacturer and purchases accessories from third-party suppliers. The Company’s cost of inventory includes an allocation of overhead, including payroll and payroll-related costs of employees directly involved in bringing inventory to its existing condition, and freight. Inventories are valued using the average cost method and are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 
The Company’s expense for excess and obsolete inventory was not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
The Company has a manufacturing agreement with Benchmark Electronics Inc. (“Benchmark”) to manufacture most of its subscriber equipment. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company may be required to purchase excess materials at cost plus a contractual markup if the materials are not used in production within the periods specified in the agreement. Benchmark will then repurchase such materials from the Company at the same price paid by the Company, as required for the production of the subscriber equipment.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation at estimated fair value. The fair value of stock options is determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is equal to the closing price of the underlying common stock on the grant date. The fair value of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service or performance period and is classified in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in a manner consistent with the classification of the recipient’s compensation. The expected vesting of the Company’s performance-based RSUs is based upon the probability that the Company achieves the defined performance goals. The level of achievement of performance goals, if any, is determined by the Compensation Committee. Stock-based awards to non-employee consultants are expensed at their grant-date fair value as services are provided according to the terms of their agreements and are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company calculates depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the useful lives of each asset. The Company applies judgment in determining the useful lives based on factors such as engineering data, long-term strategy for using the assets, the manufacturer’s estimated design life for the assets, laws and regulations that could impact the useful lives of the assets and other economic factors. The Company assesses the current estimated operational life of the satellites, including the potential impact of environmental factors on the satellites, ongoing operational enhancements and software upgrades when evaluating the useful lives of its satellites. Additionally, the Company reviews engineering data relating to the operation and performance of its satellite network. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company updated its estimate of the satellites’ remaining useful lives based on the health of the constellation and related engineering data. As a result, the estimated useful lives of the satellites were extended by five years, from 
12.5
 years to 
17.5
 years. The impact of this change for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $
27.8
 million and a decrease in hosted payload and other service revenue of approximately $
2.3
 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact of the change in useful lives of the satellites resulted in an increase in basic and diluted net income per share of $
0.21
 and $
0.20
, respectively. 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company launched five of its remaining six ground spare satellites. Following completion of successful on-orbit testing of the five launched satellites, the Company has no plans to use, develop or launch the remaining ground spare. As the Company believed the construction-in-progress associated with the remaining ground spare satellite would no longer be used, the Company wrote off the full amount remaining in construction-in-progress for that satellite by recording accelerated depreciation expense of $
37.5
 million, which more than offset the decrease in depreciation expense related to the increase in estimated useful lives of the satellites described above. 
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rate risk on variable rate debt. Its derivatives are measured at fair value and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets within other assets and other current liabilities. When the Company’s derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Any ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value will be recognized in earnings in the same period in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. Within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), the gains and losses related to cash flow hedges are recognized within interest income (expense), net, as this is the same financial statement line item associated with the hedged items. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in operating activities within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, which is the same category as the item being hedged. See 
Note 7
 for further information.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. Recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Any impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the assets’ carrying amount over their fair value.

Intangible Assets
The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If any indicators were present, the Company would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount (i.e., the asset is not recoverable), the Company would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any. The Company evaluates the useful lives for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives.
The Company’s intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. The Company’s trade names, spectrum and licenses are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
66
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenue primarily as a wholesaler of satellite communications products and services. The primary types of revenue include (i) service revenue (access and usage-based airtime fees), (ii) subscriber equipment revenue, and (iii) revenue generated by providing engineering and support services to commercial and government customers. In addition to the discussion immediately below, see 
Note 9
 for further discussion of the Company’s revenue recognition. 
Wholesaler of satellite communications products and services
Pursuant to wholesale agreements, the Company sells its products and services to service providers and recognizes revenue as it fulfills its performance obligations to the service providers, based on amounts that reflect the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products and services. The service providers, in turn, sell the products and services to other distributors or directly to the end users. The Company recognizes revenue when an arrangement exists, services or equipment are transferred, the transaction price is determined, the arrangement has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is probable. 
Contracts with multiple performance obligations
At times, the Company sells services and equipment through arrangements that bundle equipment, airtime and other services. For these revenue arrangements, when the Company sells services and equipment in bundled arrangements and determines that it has separate distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the bundled contract price among the various performance obligations based on each deliverable’s stand-alone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the amount to be allocated for each performance obligation based on observable market transactions or the residual approach. When the Company determines the performance obligations are not distinct, the Company recognizes revenue on a combined basis. To the extent the Company’s contracts include variable consideration, the transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. The variable consideration contained within the Company’s contracts with customers may include discounts, credits and other similar items. When a contract includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the estimate of the variable consideration to determine whether the estimate needs to be constrained; therefore, the Company includes the variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable consideration estimates are updated at the end of each quarter. 
Service revenue sold on a stand-alone basis
Service revenue is generated from the Company’s service providers through usage of its satellite system and through fixed monthly access fees per user charged to service providers. Revenue for usage is recognized when usage occurs and is billed in arrears with payments generally submitted within 30 days. Revenue for fixed-per-user access fees is billed monthly in advance and generally recognized over the month, or related usage period, in which the services are provided to the end user. The Company sells prepaid services in the form of e-vouchers and prepaid cards. A liability is established equal to the cash paid upon purchase for the e-voucher or prepaid card. The Company recognizes revenue from (i) the prepaid services upon the use of the e-voucher or prepaid card by the customer and (ii) the estimated pattern of use. The Company does not offer refunds for unused prepaid services.
Services sold to the U.S. government
The Company provides airtime and airtime support to U.S. government and other authorized customers pursuant to the Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services (“EMSS”) contract. Under the terms of this agreement, authorized customers continue to utilize airtime services, provided through the U.S. government’s dedicated gateway. These services include unlimited global standard and secure voice, low and high-speed data, paging, broadcast and Distributed Tactical Communications Services (“DTCS”) services for an unlimited number of Department of Defense (“DoD”) and other federal subscribers. Under this contract, revenue is based on the annual fee for the fixed-price contract with unlimited subscribers and is recognized on a straight-line basis over each contractual year, with equal payments submitted monthly. The U.S. government purchases its subscriber equipment from third-party distributors and not directly from the Company.
67
Subscriber equipment sold on a stand-alone basis
The Company recognizes subscriber equipment sales and the related costs when title to the equipment (and the risks and rewards of ownership) passes to the customer, typically upon shipment. Customers are billed when inventory is shipped, and payment is generally due within 30 days. Customers do not have rights of return without prior consent from the Company. 
Government engineering and support services
The Company provides maintenance services to the U.S. government’s dedicated gateway. This revenue is recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided; the related costs are expensed as incurred.
Other government and commercial engineering and support services
The Company also provides engineering services to assist customers in developing new technologies for use on the Company’s satellite system. Fees to customers under these agreements are generally based on milestones, and payments are submitted as milestones are achieved. The revenue associated with fixed-fee contracts is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying its performance obligation. The Company does not include purchases of goods from a third party in its evaluation of costs incurred. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. The revenue associated with cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts is recognized to the extent of estimated costs incurred plus the applicable fees earned. The Company considers fixed fees under cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract.

Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Advertising Costs
Costs associated with advertising and promotions are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $
1.3
 million, $
1.4
 million and $
1.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of tax benefits or
expenses for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The Company also recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
Net Income Per Share
The Company calculates basic net income per share by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share takes into account the effect of potentially dilutive common shares when the effect is dilutive. The effect of potentially dilutive common shares, including common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, is computed using the treasury stock method. The effect of potentially dilutive common shares from the conversion of outstanding convertible preferred securities was computed using the as-if converted method at the stated conversion rate. The Company’s unvested RSUs awarded to the board of directors contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered to be participating securities in periods of net income. The calculation of basic and diluted net income per share excludes net income attributable to these unvested RSUs from the numerator and excludes the impact of these unvested RSUs from the denominator.

Goodwill
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired Satelles, Inc. (see 
Note 
12
), resulting in a goodwill balance of $
98.2
 million as of December 31, 2024. There was no goodwill balance as of December 31, 2023. 
6. Debt 
Term Loan and Revolving Facility
Pursuant to a credit agreement (as amended to date, the “Credit Agreement”), the Company previously entered into a term loan totaling $
1,500.0
 million (as so amended and restated, the “Term Loan”), issued at a price equal to 
99.75
% of its face value, and an accompanying $
100.0
 million revolving loan (the “Revolving Facility”). The maturity of the Term Loan is in September 2030. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company borrowed an additional $325.0 million under its Term Loan, comprised of $
125.0
 million on March 25, 2024 and $
200.0
 million on July 30, 2024. The additional amounts borrowed are fungible with the original $1,500.0 million and have the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms. The additional $125.0 million was issued at a price equal to 
99.875
% of its face value, while the additional $200.0 million was issued at 
99.0
% of its face value.
The proceeds from the March 2024 additional Term Loan were used for the acquisition of Satelles, Inc. (see 
Note 
12
) on April 1, 2024. In April 2024, the Company drew down $50.0 million on its Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes, including the funding of repurchases of its common stock. This amount was repaid with the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024, and there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024. The remaining proceeds from the July 2024 additional Term Loan have been used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of common stock. 
The Term Loan has been repriced on several occasions, most recently in June 2024, and currently bears interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 
2.25
%, with a 
0.75
% SOFR floor. The Company typically selects a one-month interest period, with the result that interest is calculated using one-month SOFR. Interest is paid monthly on the last business day of the month. Principal payments, payable quarterly, equal $
18.3
 million per annum (one percent of the full principal amount of the Term Loan following the additional Term Loan amounts borrowed in 2024), with the remaining principal due upon maturity.
The Revolving Facility bears interest at the same rate (but without a SOFR floor) if and as drawn, with no original issue discount, a commitment fee of 
0.5
% per year on the undrawn amount, which is reduced to 
0.375
% if the Company has a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1, and a maturity date in September 2028. 
The Company paid fees of $
2.3
 million in connection with the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024, $
1.9
 million related to the repricing of the Term Loan in June 2024 and $
1.6
 million in connection with the expansion of the Term Loan in March 2024, substantially all of which were expensed as incurred. The amounts expensed are included within interest expense. 
In September 2023, the Company paid $
3.8
 million of issuance costs to refinance the Term Loan, which costs were deferred and will be amortized through the term of the loan. Lenders making up approximately $
16.8
 million of the Term Loan did not participate in the refinancing. Those portions of the Term Loan were replaced by new or existing lenders. This resulted in an immaterial loss on extinguishment of debt, as the Company wrote off the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the lenders who were fully repaid in an exchange of principal. The Company deferred an additional $
1.2
 million of third-party fees associated with the refinancing of the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility in September 2023. 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company elected to prepay $
100.0
 million of principal on the Term Loan. This resulted in a $
1.2
 million loss on extinguishment of debt, as the Company wrote off the unamortized debt issuance costs related to this prepayment. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company reported an aggregate of $
1,807.7
 million and $
1,500.0
 million in borrowings under the Term Loan, respectively. These amounts do not include $
16.9
 million and $
17.5
 million of net unamortized deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net principal balance in borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $
1,790.9
 million and $
1,482.5
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, based upon over-the-counter bid levels (Level 2 - market approach), the fair value of the borrowings under the Term Loan was $
1,802.1
 million and

$
1,506.6
 million, respectively. The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
71
The Credit Agreement restricts the Company’s ability to incur liens, engage in mergers or asset sales, pay dividends, repay subordinated indebtedness, incur indebtedness, make investments and loans, and engage in other transactions as specified in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for specified exceptions, including baskets measured as a percentage of trailing twelve months of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and unlimited exceptions in the case of incurring indebtedness and liens and making investments, dividend payments, and payments of subordinated indebtedness, based on achievement and maintenance of specified leverage ratios. The Credit Agreement also contains an annual mandatory prepayment sweep mechanism with respect to a portion of the Company’s excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the event the Company’s net leverage ratio rises above 3.5 to 1. The Company’s mandatory excess cash flow prepayment, as specified in the Credit Agreement, was $
28.6
 million as of December 31, 2024. This amount will be paid in 2025 and will be applied to the Company’s required quarterly principal payments. As such, it was classified under current short-term secured debt in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. The Credit Agreement permits repayment, prepayment and repricing transactions, subject, in the case of the Term Loan, to a 1% penalty in the event the Term Loan is prepaid or repriced within the first six months from the refinancing date.
The Credit Agreement contains no financial maintenance covenants with respect to the Term Loan. With respect to the Revolving Facility, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 
6.25
 to 1 if more than 
35
% of the Revolving Facility has been drawn. The Credit Agreement contains other customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2024.
Interest on Debt
Total interest incurred includes amortization of deferred financing fees and capitalized interest. The Company incurred third-party financing costs of $
15.9
 million in connection with the refinancing of the Term Loan in September 2023, of which $
14.7
 million was expensed. All third-party financing costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were expensed. All amounts expensed are included within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

The table above includes only the cash flow sweep amount payable in 2025 with respect to 2024 excess cash. The schedule excludes future amounts that may be required to be prepaid pursuant to the excess cash flow sweep provision of the Credit Agreement, as those amounts are not determinable in advance.

7. 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations related to its Term Loan. The Company has reduced its exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows associated with changes in the variable interest rate by entering into offsetting positions through the use of interest rate hedges. This will reduce the negative impact of increases in the variable rate over the term of the derivative contracts. These contracts are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. Historically, the Company has not incurred, and does not expect to incur in the future, any losses as a result of counterparty default.
Hedge effectiveness of the current interest rate cap agreement (the “Cap”) is based on a long-haul hypothetical derivative methodology and includes all changes in value. The Company formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing quarterly basis, whether the designated derivative instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items. When the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated, is exercised, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, is de-designated, or is no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
Interest Rate Cap
In July 2021, the Company entered into the Cap, which had an effective date of December 2021. The Cap manages the Company’s exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of the Term Loan through November 2026. The Cap, as modified to date, currently provides the Company with the right to receive payment from the counterparty if one-month SOFR exceeds 
1.436
%. The Company pays a fixed monthly premium based on an annual rate of 
0.31
% for the Cap. The Cap carried a notional amount of $
1.0
 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Cap, which was not affected by the expansion of the Term Loan in July 2024 and March 2024 or the repricing of the Term Loan in June 2024 and September 2023, is designed to mirror the terms of the Term Loan and to offset the cash flows being hedged. The Company designated the Cap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the SOFR-based rate interest payments on the Term Loan. The effective portion of the Cap’s change in fair value will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of the Cap’s change in fair value will be recorded in current earnings as interest expense.
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an asset balance of $
47.3
 million and $
66.5
 million, respectively, for the fair value of the Cap, and a liability balance of $
5.6
 million and $
8.4
 million, respectively, for the fair value of the Cap premium. Both the Cap and the Cap premium are recorded within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
73
During each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company collectively incurred $
3.3
 million in net interest expense for the cost of the interest rate hedges. Interest expense was reduced by $38.2 million, $
36.2
 million and $
7.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for payments received related to the Cap. Gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to the Cap are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and reclassified to interest expense on the dates that interest payments become due. Cash flows related to the derivative contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Over the next 12 months, the Company expects any gains or losses for cash flow hedges amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings to have an immaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The following table presents the amount of unrealized gain or loss and related tax impact associated with the derivative instruments that the Company recorded in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss):

Equity Transactions
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue 
2.0
 million shares of preferred stock with a par value of $
0.0001
 per share. The Company previously issued 
1.5
 million shares of preferred stock. The remaining 
0.5
 million authorized shares of preferred stock remain undesignated and unissued as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding shares of preferred stock, as all previously designated and issued preferred stock was converted into common stock in prior periods.
Dividends 
Stockholders are entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Company’s Board of Directors from time to time, such dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property from the Company’s assets or funds legally and contractually available for such purposes. In December 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend. The Company paid dividends of $
0.13
 per share of common stock for each quarter of 2023 and for the first quarter of 2024. The Company paid dividends of $
0.14
 per share of common stock for each of the quarters ended June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2024. The dividends resulted in total payments of $
64.7
 million and $
64.8
 million during the years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s liability related to dividends on common stock was $
2.5
 million and $
1.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Share Repurchase Program
Since February 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $
1,500.0
 million of the Company’s common stock, including the most recent approval in September 2024 of $500.0 million through December 31, 2027. This time frame can be extended or shortened by the Board of Directors. Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. The Company records share repurchases at cost, which includes broker commissions and related excise taxes. All shares are immediately retired upon repurchase in accordance with the board-approved policy. When treasury shares are retired, the Company’s policy is to allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired first, to additional paid-in capital, and then to retained earnings/accumulated deficit. The portion to be allocated to additional paid-in capital is calculated by applying a percentage, determined by dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares outstanding, to the balance of additional paid-in capital as of the date of retirement.
The Company repurchased and subsequently retired 
14.0
 million, 
4.8
 million and 
6.8
 million shares of its common stock during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for a total purchase price of $
403.8
 million, $
244.6
 million and $
257.0
 million, respectively, exclusive of $
3.6
 million and $1.4 million of excise taxes incurred in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with no such taxes incurred in the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, in 
74
December 2023, the Company repurchased 
26,000
 shares for $
1.0
 million, which were settled and retired in January 2024. As such, these shares were recorded as treasury stock as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, $
430.3
 million remained available and authorized for repurchase under this program.

The Company’s contracts with customers generally do not contain performance obligations with terms in excess of one year. As such, the Company does not disclose details related to the value of performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The total value of any performance obligations that extend beyond a year is immaterial to the financial statements. 
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and deferred revenue (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company bills amounts under its agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals (for services), upon shipment (for equipment), or upon achievement of contractual milestones or as work progresses (for engineering and support services). Billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in unbilled accounts receivable (contract assets). The Company may also receive payments from customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue (contract liabilities). The Company recognized revenue that was previously recorded as deferred revenue in the amounts of $
36.9
 million, $
31.4
 million and $
26.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
The Company has also recorded costs of obtaining contracts expected to be recovered in prepaid expenses and other current assets (contract assets or commissions), that are not separately disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets. The commissions are recognized over the estimated usage period.

Leases
The Company has operating leases for land, office space, satellite network operations center (“SNOC”) facilities, system gateway facilities, a warehouse and a distribution center. The Company also has operations and maintenance (“O&M”) agreements that include leases associated with two teleport network facilities. Some of the Company’s leases include options to extend the leases for up to 
8
 years. The Company does not include term extension options as part of its present value calculation of lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain to exercise those options. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s weighted-average remaining lease term relating to its operating leases was 
4.4
 years, and the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the operating lease liability payment was 
6.8
%.

6.0
 million, $
5.2
 million and $
5.2

Lessor Arrangements
Operating leases in which the Company is a lessor consist primarily of hosting agreements with Aireon LLC

(“Aireon”) (see 
Note 14
)

and L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“L3Harris”) for space on the Company’s satellites. These agreements provide for a fee that will be recognized over the estimated useful lives of the satellites, which is now approximately 
17.5
 years, prospectively from the change in estimated useful lives of the satellites that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. Lease income related to these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
12.4
 million, $
19.2
 million and $
21.4
 million, respectively. The decreases in 2024 and 2023 as compared to 2022 were solely the result of the timing of the change in estimated useful life of the satellites. Lease income is recorded as hosted payload and other data service revenue within service revenue on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

. Stock-Based Compensation
In May 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Company’s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as so amended and restated, the “Amended 2015 Plan”). As of December 31, 2024, the remaining aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for future grants under the Amended 2015 Plan was 
8,410,558
. The Amended 2015 Plan provides for the grant of stock-based awards, including nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights and other equity securities to employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company and its affiliated entities. The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended 2015 Plan is reduced by (i) 
one
 share for each share of common stock issued pursuant to an appreciation award, such as a stock option or stock appreciation right with an exercise or strike price of at least 
100
% of the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, and (ii) 
1.8
 shares for each share of common stock issued pursuant to any stock award that is not an appreciation award, also referred to as a “full value award.” The Amended 2015 Plan allows the Company to utilize a broad array of equity incentives and performance cash incentives in order to secure and retain the services of its employees, directors and consultants, and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of its employees, directors and consultants with the interests of the Company’s stockholders. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation at estimated fair value. 
Restricted Stock Units
Beginning in March 2024, the RSUs granted to employees for service generally vest over three years, with 34% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting ratably on a quarterly basis thereafter, subject to continued employment. RSUs granted prior to March 2024 generally vested over 
four years
, with 
25
% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting ratably on a quarterly basis thereafter, subject to continued employment. Some RSUs granted to employees for performance vest upon the completion of defined performance goals, subject to continued employment. The RSUs granted to non-employee directors generally vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs granted to non-employee consultants generally vest 50% on the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining 50% vesting quarterly thereafter through the second anniversary of the grant date. 
The Company’s RSUs are classified as equity awards because the RSUs will be settled in the Company’s common stock upon vesting. The fair value of RSUs is determined at the grant date based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The related compensation expense is recognized over the service period, or shorter periods based on the retirement eligibility of certain grantees, based on the grant date fair value of the Company’s common stock and the number of shares expected to vest. The fair value of the awards is not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. RSUs do not carry voting rights until the RSUs are vested, although unvested RSUs and vested but unsettled RSUs granted to non-employee directors are entitled to accrue dividend equivalent rights, and shares (including additional shares issuable upon satisfaction of any accrued dividend equivalent rights) are issued upon settlement in accordance with the terms of the award.

     These RSUs were granted to the Company’s board of directors as a part of their compensation for board and committee service and had vested but had not yet settled, meaning that the underlying shares of common stock had not been issued and released. 
As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized cost related to non-vested RSUs was approximately $
46.8
 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.1
 years. The Company recognized $
63.5
 million, $
57.5
 million and $
43.2
 million of stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Service-Based RSUs
The majority of the annual compensation the Company provides to non-employee members of its board of directors is paid in the form of RSUs. In addition, some members of the Company’s board of directors elect to receive their cash retainers, or a portion thereof, in the form of RSUs. An aggregate amount of approximately 
60,000
, 
55,000
 and 
57,000
 service-based RSUs were granted to the Company’s non-employee directors as a result of these payments and elections during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, with an estimated grant date fair value of $
1.9
 million, $
2.9
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted approximately 
1,691,000
, 
746,000
 and 
1,082,000
 service-based RSUs, respectively, to its employees, with an estimated aggregate grant date fair value of $
49.9
 million, $
43.0
 million and $
44.2
 million, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted approximately 
14,000
, 
1,000
 and 
7,000
 service-based RSUs, respectively, to non-employee consultants, with an estimated grant date fair value of $
0.8
 million, $
0.1
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively. 
Performance-Based RSUs
In March 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company awarded approximately 
461,000
, 
193,000
 and 
248,000
 performance-based RSUs, respectively, to the Company’s executives and employees (the “Bonus RSUs”), with an estimated grant date fair value of $
13.7
 million, $
11.9
 million and $
9.7
 million, respectively. Vesting of the Bonus RSUs is and was dependent upon the Company’s achievement of defined performance goals for the respective fiscal year in which the Bonus RSUs were granted. The Company records stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based RSUs when it is considered probable that the 
78
performance conditions will be met. Management believes it is probable that substantially all of the 2024 Bonus RSUs will vest. The level of achievement, if any, of performance goals will be determined by the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors and, if such goals are achieved, the 2024 Bonus RSUs will vest, subject to continued employment, in March 2025. Substantially all of the Bonus RSUs awarded in 2023 and 2022 vested in March 2024 and March 2023, respectively, upon the determination of the level of achievement of the respective performance goals.
Additionally, during 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company awarded approximately 
303,000
, 
134,000
 and 
167,000
 performance-based RSUs, respectively, to the Company’s executives (the “Executive RSUs”). The estimated aggregate grant date fair value of the Executive RSUs for the 2024, 2023 and 2022 grants was $
9.0
 million, $
8.2
 million and $
6.5
 million, respectively. Vesting of the Executive RSUs is dependent upon the Company’s achievement of defined performance goals over a two-year period (the year of grant and the following year). The vesting of Executive RSUs will ultimately range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the number of shares underlying the Executive RSUs granted based on the level of achievement of the performance goals. 
If the Company achieves the performance goals for the Executive RSUs at the end of the two-year performance period, 
50
% of the number of Executive RSUs earned based on performance will then vest on the second anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining 
50
% will then vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, in each case subject to the executive’s continued service as of the vesting date. In March 2024 and 2023, the Company awarded approximately 
83,000
 and 
55,000
 additional shares related to performance-based RSUs granted to the Company’s executives for over-achievement of performance targets for the Executive RSUs with a performance period that ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In March 2022, the Company cancelled approximately 
50,000
 shares related to performance-based RSUs granted to the Company’s executives for under-achievement of performance targets for the performance period that ended December 31, 2021. 
Stock Option Awards
The Company last granted stock options in 2019. The stock option awards granted to employees generally (i) have a term of ten years, (ii) vest over four years with 25% vesting after the first year of service and the remainder vesting ratably on a quarterly basis thereafter, (iii) are contingent upon employment on the vesting date, and (iv) have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options was determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.

12. Acquisition of Satelles
On April 1, 2024, the Company acquired Satelles, Inc., a provider of satellite-based time and location services that complement and protect GPS and other GNSS systems. This acquisition is intended to support the Company’s long-term business objectives. 
79
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration paid to acquire the remaining 
80.5
% of the outstanding shares and voting interest of Satelles that was not previously owned by the Company was approximately $
125.5
 million. The Company accounted for the acquired business using the acquisition method of accounting by recording assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values.

The Company acquired customer relationship intangible assets with an acquisition date fair value of $57.0 million, which was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. The Company included the following assumptions: the forecasted revenue growth, forecasted revenue attributable to customer contracts, forecasted capital expenditures, forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins, and the discount rate used to value the customer relationships. Changes in these assumptions used could have a significant impact on the acquisition-date fair value of this intangible asset. The customer relationships recognized were determined to have a useful life of 12 years. The Company will amortize the customer relationships over their useful lives, utilizing the economic benefit model. The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of Satelles. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. During the period ended December 31, 2024, the Company updated its estimate related to deferred taxes, which resulted in a decrease in goodwill and an increase to deferred tax assets of $2.1 million. These updates are reflected in the table above. 
The Company incurred $
3.1
 million of acquisition related costs that were expensed in the year ended December 31, 2024. These costs are included within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
The amounts of revenue and earnings of Satelles included in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), excluding the impact of the Company’s remeasurement of its prior equity interest in Satelles, are as follows:

Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company nets deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of $
1.8
 million that is included in other assets on the balance sheet and a net deferred tax liability of $
114.1
 million. 
The Company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, management considers: (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (iii) taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under applicable tax law; and (iv) tax planning strategies.
The Company had deferred tax assets related to cumulative U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and interest expense carryforwards of approximately $
209.9
 million and $
257.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2017 U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward, if not utilized, will expire in 2037. The Company believes that the 2017 U.S. federal net operating losses will be utilized before the expiration date and, as such, no valuation allowance has been established for this deferred tax asset. U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards for 2018 and thereafter and interest expense carryforwards do not expire. The Company had deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards of 
82
approximately $
55.9
 million and $
59.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not expect to fully utilize all of its state net operating losses within the respective carryforward periods and as such reflects a partial valuation allowance of $
32.8
 million and $
33.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, against these deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company had deferred tax assets related to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
0.4
 million and $
0.5
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company does not expect to fully utilize all of its foreign net operating losses within the carryforward periods. As such, the Company had recorded a partial valuation allowance of $
0.1
 million and $
0.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, against these deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheets. The timing and manner in which the Company will utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in any year, or in total, may be limited in the future as a result of changes in the Company’s ownership and any limitations imposed by the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
The Company had approximately $
42.3
 million and $
32.3
 million of deferred tax assets related to research and development tax credits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that expire in various amounts from 2032 through 2044. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company established a reserve of approximately $
3.5
 million and $
2.4
 million on its estimate of R&D credits, respectively. The Company had approximately $
7.9
 million and $
8.7
 million of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that expire in various amounts through 2034. There is no valuation allowance on foreign tax credits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company has provided for U.S. income taxes on all undistributed earnings of its significant foreign subsidiaries since the
Company does not indefinitely reinvest these undistributed earnings. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities
using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.
Uncertain Income Tax Positions
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
in evaluating tax positions and determining the provision for income taxes. The Company establishes liabilities for tax-related
uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. These liabilities are
established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite its belief that its tax return positions
are fully supportable. The Company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to these liabilities.
The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $
3.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to additional U.S. tax credits from prior periods. There were unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $
2.4
 million as of December 31, 2023. Any changes in the next twelve months are not anticipated to have a significant impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company. The Company has elected an accounting policy to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. 
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits which includes related interest and penalties:

The Company is subject to tax audits in all jurisdictions for which it files tax returns. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. Currently, there are no U.S. federal, state or foreign jurisdiction tax audits pending. The Company’s corporate U.S. federal and state tax returns from 2011 to 2023 remain subject to examination by tax authorities and the Company’s foreign tax returns from 2017 to 2023 remain subject to examination by tax authorities.

Related Party Transactions
Aireon LLC and Aireon Holdings LLC
The Company’s satellite constellation hosts the Aireon
® 
system. The Aireon system was developed by Aireon LLC, which the Company formed in 2011 and which received subsequent investments from several air navigation service providers (“ANSPs”) to provide a global air traffic surveillance service through a series of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (“ADS-B”) receivers on the Company’s satellites. Aireon has contracted to offer this service to ANSPs, which use the service to provide improved air traffic control services over the oceans, as well as polar and remote regions. Aireon also markets its data and services to airlines and other commercial users. The Company and the other Aireon investors hold their interests in Aireon Holdings LLC (“Aireon Holdings”) through an amended and restated LLC agreement (the “Aireon Holdings LLC Agreement”). Aireon Holdings holds 100% of the membership interests in Aireon, which is the operating entity. 
In June 2022, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Aireon Holdings and invested $
50.0
 million in exchange for an approximately 
6
% preferred membership interest. The Company’s investment in Aireon Holdings is accounted for as an equity method investment. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in Aireon Holdings was $
41.5
 million and $
44.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The investments by the Company prior to June 2022 had previously been written down to a carrying value of zero.
At each of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s fully diluted ownership stake in Aireon Holdings was approximately 
39.5
%, which is subject to partial future redemption under provisions contained in the Aireon Holdings LLC Agreement.
Under the agreements with Aireon, Aireon will pay the Company fees of $
200.0
 million to host the ADS-B receivers, of which $
110.5
 million had been paid as of December 31, 2024. These fees are recognized over the estimated useful lives of the satellites, which is expected to result in revenue of approximately $9.3 million per year, following the change in estimate of the useful lives of the satellites that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company recognized hosting fee revenue of $
9.3
 million, $
14.4
 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no receivables due from Aireon for hosting fees as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
Additionally, Aireon pays power and data services fees of approximately $23.5 million per year, in the aggregate, for the delivery of the air traffic surveillance data over the Iridium system. The Company recorded $
23.5
 million of power and data service fee revenue from Aireon for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Receivables due from Aireon under this agreement totaled $2.0 million as of December 31, 2024. There were no receivables due under this agreement as of December 31, 2023. 
Under two services agreements, the Company also provides Aireon with administrative services and support services, the fees for which are paid monthly. Aireon receivables due to the Company under these two agreements totaled $1.7 million and $
2.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The Company and the other Aireon investors have agreed to participate pro rata, based on their respective fully diluted ownership stakes, in funding an investor bridge loan to Aireon. The Company’s maximum commitment under the investor bridge loan is $
11.9
 million. No bridge loan amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.

Net Income Per Share
The Company calculates basic net income per common share by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. In periods of net income, diluted net income per share takes into account the effect of potentially dilutive common shares when the effect is dilutive. Potentially dilutive common shares include (i) shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and (ii) shares underlying RSUs that are contingently issuable upon achievement of certain service and performance requirements. The effect of potentially dilutive common shares is computed using the treasury stock method.

Segments, Significant Customers, Supplier and Service Providers and Geographic Information
The Company’s operations are primarily located in the United States and the Company operates in one business segment, providing global satellite communications services and products. Its Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make key operating decisions and assess performance. 
The CODM evaluates the segment operating performance based on consolidated net income and reviews components of cost of services, including certain costs related to delivering engineering and other support services, which is considered a significant expense. Costs to support engineering and other support services, included within cost of services in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), were $93.7 million, $77.6 million and $35.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The CODM considers budget-to-actual forecast and prior view-to-current view variances on a monthly and quarterly basis for evaluating performance and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources on a consolidated basis. 
The Company derived approximately 
27
%, 
25
% and 
21
% of its total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from prime contracts or subcontracts with agencies of the U.S. government. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no single commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue.
Approximately 
51
% and 
46
% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was due from prime contracts or subcontracts with agencies of the U.S. government. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no single commercial customer accounted for more than 
10
% of the Company’s total accounts receivable balance.
The Company contracts for the manufacture of its subscriber equipment primarily from a limited number of manufacturers and utilizes other sole source suppliers for certain component parts of its devices. Should events or circumstances prevent the manufacturer or the suppliers from producing the equipment or component parts, the Company’s business could be adversely 
85
affected until the Company is able to move production to other facilities of the manufacturer or secure a replacement manufacturer or an alternative supplier for such component parts.

Revenue is attributed to geographic area based on the billing address of the distributor. Service location and the billing address are often not the same. The Company’s distributors sell services directly or indirectly to end users, who may be located or use the Company’s products and services elsewhere. The Company does not know the geographical distribution of end users because it does not contract directly with them. 
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations from sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who is our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. In evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Such internal control includes those policies and procedures that:
•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company;
•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of our company; and
•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on its assessment, our management has determined that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
Iridium Communications Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Iridium Communications Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
