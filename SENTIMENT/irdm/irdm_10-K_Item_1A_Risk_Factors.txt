led by our chief information officer, who has 20 years of experience in information technology roles and supported by our director of information security, who holds several certifications in the field of information security and technology
. 
In addition to our chief information officer, our internal management security committee includes our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operations officer and chief legal officer, as well as others within our organization in information technology roles.

Our chief information officer is responsible for hiring appropriate personnel and helping to integrate cybersecurity risk considerations into our overall risk management strategy and communicating key priorities to relevant personnel. Our chief information officer is also responsible for approving budgets, helping prepare for cybersecurity incidents, approving cybersecurity processes and reviewing security assessments and other security-related reports. 
Our cybersecurity incident response and vulnerability management processes are designed to escalate certain cybersecurity incidents to members of management depending on the circumstances. Information regarding cyber incidents is reported at the monthly meeting of the management security committee or sooner if warranted. Members of this committee work with our incident response team to help mitigate and remediate cybersecurity incidents of which they are notified. Our incident response and vulnerability management processes include reporting by management to the board of directors for certain cybersecurity incidents.

The board generally receives quarterly reports from our chief operations officer, chief information officer or other members of management, as well as periodic presentations from outside advisors concerning our significant cybersecurity threats and risk and the processes we have implemented to address them. The board also has access to various reports, summaries or presentations related to cybersecurity threats, risk and mitigation.
