Overview

We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors. Endocrine pathways function to maintain homeostasis and commonly use peptide hormones acting through GPCRs to regulate many aspects of physiology, including growth, energy, metabolism, gastrointestinal function and stress responses. We have built a highly productive drug discovery and development organization with extensive expertise in endocrine GPCRs. We have discovered a pipeline of oral nonpeptide (small molecule) new chemical entities that target peptide GPCRs to treat a variety of endocrine diseases where treatment options have significant efficacy, safety and/or tolerability limitations. Our product candidates include paltusotine, which is in clinical development for the treatment of acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome associated with NETs, and atumelnant, which is in clinical development for CAH and Cushing’s disease. We are advancing additional product candidates through preclinical discovery and development studies in parallel. Our vision is to build a premier endocrine-focused, global biopharmaceutical company that consistently pioneers new therapeutics to improve the lives of patients.

We focus on the discovery and development of nonpeptide therapeutics that target peptide GPCRs with well-understood biological functions, validated biomarkers and the potential to substantially improve the treatment of endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors.

To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining and maintaining patents related to our product candidates, licensing activities, and the provision of general and administrative support for these operations. We have recognized revenues from various research and development grants and license and collaboration agreements, but do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through our grant and license revenues and offerings of our preferred and common stock. As of December 31, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $1.4 billion.

We have incurred cumulative net losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $952.1 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and preclinical studies and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially as we conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials, continue our research and development activities and conduct preclinical studies, hire additional personnel, protect our intellectual property and incur costs associated with being a public company, including audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs.

We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially, collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, scale back or discontinue the development of our existing product candidates or our efforts to expand our product pipeline.

Australian operations

In January 2017, we established Crinetics Australia Pty Ltd, or CAPL, a wholly-owned subsidiary which was formed to conduct various preclinical and clinical activities for our product and development candidates. CAPL is eligible for certain financial incentives made available by the Australian government for research and development expenses. Specifically, the Australian Taxation Office provides a refundable tax credit in the form of a cash refund equal to 43.5% of qualified research and development expenditures under the Australian Research and Development Tax Incentive Program, or the Australian Tax Incentive, to Australian companies that operate the majority of their research and development activities associated with such

73

projects in Australia. A wholly-owned Australian subsidiary of a non-Australian parent company is eligible to receive the refundable tax credit, provided that the Australian subsidiary retains the rights to the data and intellectual property generated in Australia, and provided that the total revenues of the parent company and its consolidated subsidiaries during the period for which the refundable tax credit is claimed are less than $20.0 million Australian dollars. If we lose our ability to operate CAPL in Australia, or if we are ineligible or unable to receive the research and development tax credit, or the Australian government significantly reduces or eliminates the tax credit, the actual refund amounts we receive may differ from our estimates. See "Note 2" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the reductions we have recognized in connection with the Australian Tax Incentive.

Swiss operations

In September 2024, we established Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Europe GmbH, or CPEG, a wholly-owned subsidiary which was formed, among other things, to conduct various clinical and pre-commercialization activities for our product candidates in Europe.

Recent Developments

Product Candidates

In March 2024, we reported positive topline results from the PATHFNDR-2 study, where the study met statistical significance on the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints also met statistical significance. We submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for paltusotine for the proposed treatment and long-term maintenance therapy of acromegaly and subsequently received notification of acceptance from the FDA on the status of the NDA submission and were granted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, Target Action Date of September 25, 2025.

We have initiated the CAREFNDR Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with carcinoid syndrome. CAREFNDR is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sixteen-week clinical trial to enroll carcinoid syndrome patients who are not on pharmacological treatment and are actively symptomatic. The primary endpoint of the CAREFNDR trial is the percentage change in the frequency of flushing episodes at week 12 as compared to the baseline measurement. In addition, a key secondary endpoint measures the change in bowel movement frequency at week 12 as compared to the baseline measurement. There are additional efficacy endpoints in the CAREFNDR trial including severity of flushing and urgency of bowel movements.

In February 2025, the EMA granted paltusotine orphan drug designation for the treatment of acromegaly. Designation was given following a positive recommendation from the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, highlighting the potential impact of paltusotine for acromegaly patients in the European Union.

See other updates in the business overview section above.

Licenses

On March 24, 2023, we and Cellular Longevity Inc., doing business as Loyal, entered into the Loyal License, pursuant to which we granted Loyal an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CRN01941, a somatostatin receptor type 2 agonist, for veterinary use.

In August 2023, the Radionetics License was amended to include additional sales milestones of up to $15.0 million. Following the amendment to the Radionetics License, we are eligible to receive total potential sales milestones in excess of $1.0 billion and single-digit royalties on net sales.

In June 2024, the Company amended the Radionetics License to reduce the number of development targets.  Following the amendment to the Radionetics License, ownership of the non-licensed targets reverted back to the Company and the Company is eligible to receive total potential sales milestones in excess of $300.0 million and single-digit royalties on net sales.  In July 2024, Radionetics announced the formation of a strategic partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly.  Under the terms of the agreement, Radionetics received a $140.0 million upfront cash payment and Lilly obtained the exclusive right to acquire Radionetics for $1.0 billion upon conclusion of an exercise period. During the exercise period, Radionetics will continue to build out a proprietary pipeline of therapeutic assets.

Equity Offerings

On March 1, 2024, the Company completed a private placement offering of 8,333,334 shares of its common stock at a price of $42.00 per share, or the Private Placement. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $335.5 million, after offering costs of approximately $14.5 million. On March 19, 2024, the Company registered for resale the shares issued and sold in the Private Placement, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement entered into with the Purchasers, dated February 27, 2024.

On October 10, 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $50.00 per share, which included 1,500,000 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the

74

underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $542.8 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of approximately $32.2 million.

ATM Offerings

On August 13, 2019, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement, as subsequently amended in August 2022, or the 2019 Sales Agreement, with SVB Leerink LLC and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or collectively, the Sales Agents, under which the Company could, from time to time, sell up to $150.0 million of shares of its common stock through the Sales Agents, or the 2019 ATM Offering. The 2019 ATM Offering was terminated upon the filing by the Company of its Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR on June 21, 2024.

On June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement, the 2024 Sales Agreement, with the Sales Agents under which the Company may, from time to time, sell up to $350.0 million of shares of its common stock through the Sales Agents, or the 2024 ATM Offering.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued 1,223,775 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2019 ATM Offering for net proceeds of approximately $43.4 million, after deducting commissions.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued 928,912 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2024 ATM Offering for net proceeds of approximately $48.3 million, after deducting commissions.

Financial operations overview

Revenues

To date, our revenues have been mainly derived from research grant awards and licenses, including the Radionetics License, the Sanwa License, and the Loyal License. As our data exchange performance obligation under the Sanwa License is fulfilled, we expect to recognize as revenues the deferred revenue amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. We will recognize royalty and milestone revenues under our license agreements if and when appropriate under the relevant accounting rules (see "Note 8" to our consolidated financial statements). We have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of approved products, and we may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of our product candidates for at least the foreseeable future, if ever.

License revenues

On March 24, 2023, we and Loyal entered into the Loyal License, pursuant to which we granted Loyal an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CRN01941, a somatostatin receptor type 2 agonist, for veterinary use. In February 2022, we and Sanwa entered into a license agreement, or the Sanwa License, pursuant to which whereby we granted Sanwa an exclusive license to develop and commercialize paltusotine in Japan.

License revenues for 2024 were primarily derived from the Sanwa License. License revenues for 2023 were primarily derived from both the Sanwa License and the Loyal License.

Clinical supply revenues

On June 14, 2022, we and Sanwa entered into a clinical supply agreement, or the Sanwa Clinical Supply Agreement, whereby we are responsible for manufacturing and supplying certain materials to Sanwa for specified activities under the Sanwa License. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of revenues from the Sanwa Clinical Supply Agreement in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. No significant supply purchases were made by Sanwa through the Sanwa Clinical Supply Agreement.

Research and development

To date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.

Research and development expenses include:

•
salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts; 

•
external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites and consultants to conduct our clinical trials and preclinical and nonclinical studies;

75

•
costs related to manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and preclinical studies, including fees paid to third-party manufacturers;

•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; 

•
laboratory supplies; and

•
facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses for rent, facilities maintenance, insurance, equipment and other supplies.

We recognize the Australian Tax Incentive as a reduction of research and development expense. The amounts are determined based on eligible research and development expenditures. The Australian Tax Incentive is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Australian Tax Incentive will be received, the relevant expenditure has been incurred, and the amount of the Australian Tax Incentive can be reliably measured.

Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to CROs, investigative sites and consultants in connection with our clinical trials, preclinical and non-clinical studies, and costs related to manufacturing clinical trial materials. The majority of our third-party expenses during the three years ended December 31, 2024 related to the research and development of paltusotine, atumelnant, and discovery. We deploy our personnel and facility related resources across all of our research and development activities.

Our clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:

•
per patient trial costs;

•
the number of trials required for approval;

•
the number of sites included in the trials;

•
the countries in which the trials are conducted;

•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;

•
the number of patients that participate in the trials;

•
number of doses that patients receive;

•
drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;

•
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;

•
the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;

•
the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates;

•
the number of product candidates;

•
the phase of development of our product candidates; and

•
the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates.

We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and the discovery of new product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each product candidate’s commercial potential. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.

General and administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and other administrative functions. Other significant costs include facility-related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting and consulting services, insurance costs, and commercial planning expenses. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities and, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, commercialization activities. We also incur expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums, as well as commercial preparedness, corporate strategy and business development, corporate communications, and investor relations costs associated with operating as a public company.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those listed below. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, information received from third parties and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time the estimates are made, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There were no material differences between estimates and actual results for the years presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in "Note 2" to the consolidated financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Accrued research and development expenses

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.

We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.

Costs incurred under contracts with contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct and manage our clinical trials are also included in research and development expenses. The financial terms and activities of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expense levels. Clinical trial activities are accrued and expensed based on estimates of the period in which services and efforts are expended by CROs and other third parties. Estimates are determined by reviewing cost information provided by CROs, other third-party vendors and internal clinical personnel, and contractual arrangements with CROs and the scope of work to be performed.  If the amounts that we are obligated to pay under our clinical trial agreements are modified (for instance, because of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), we adjust our accruals accordingly on a prospective basis. Revisions to contractual payment obligations are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.

Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.

Leases

When our leases do not provide an implicit rate, an incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at accounting commencement dates in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would expect to pay to borrow over a similar term, and on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. On September 9, 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for laboratory and office space in San Diego, California, or the 2022 Lease. The incremental borrowing rate for the 2022 Lease was determined using a synthetic credit rating analysis.

Research and development expenses for our CRN04777 clinical studies were $0.6 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to decreased spending on manufacturing and development activities of $2.3 million and decreased nonclinical activities of $4.6 million as a result of the clinical hold received from the FDA in November 2022, which delayed the advancement of CRN04777 prior to our discontinuation of its clinical development in August 2023.

Research and development expenses for our early research and development programs were $25.4 million and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in outside services of $3.3 million, increased spending on manufacturing and development activities of $5.9 million and increased spending on nonclinical activities of $3.4 million as a result of the expansion of our discovery efforts across new therapeutic targets.

Research and development expenses for payroll and benefits were $78.8 million and $53.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our ongoing programs as well as for the expansion of our discovery efforts into new therapeutic targets.

Stock-based compensation for research and development personnel was $40.7 million and $22.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our ongoing programs as well as for the expansion of our discovery efforts across new therapeutic targets.

Other research and development expenses were $22.1 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due an increase in outside services of $2.2 million and an increase in facilities expenditures of $6.3 million driven by our move to our new headquarters.

General and administrative expenses.
     General and administrative expenses were $99.7 million and $58.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $23.8 million, an increase in outside services of $10.9 million to support our growth, and an increase in facilities expenditures of $3.0 million driven by our move to our new headquarters.

Other income.
     Other income, net was $40.9 million and $13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to income generated by our investment securities.

Loss on equity method investment.  
   Loss on equity method investment was $0.5 million and $5.2 million for years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2024 loss on equity methods investment was due to our share of loss in Radionetics’ net loss, which is recorded on a quarterly lag. The 2023 loss on equity method investment was due to our share of loss in Radionetics’ net loss subsequent to the August 2023 Radionetics stock purchase and Radionetics Warrant exercise.

Cash Flows

We have incurred cumulative net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $952.1 million and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $1.4 billion.

Operating Activities.     
Net cash used in operating activities was $226.0 million and $166.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in operations was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs. The net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to our net loss of $298.4 million adjusted for $60.8 million of noncash charges, primarily for stock-based compensation, and a $11.6 million change in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to our net loss of $214.5 million adjusted for $40.2 million of noncash charges, primarily for stock-based compensation and loss on the investment in Radionetics, and an $8.0 million change in operating assets and liabilities.

Investing activities.
      Investing activities consist primarily of purchases and maturities of investment securities and, to a lesser extent, the cash outflow associated with purchases of property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we also invested $5.0 million to purchase preferred stock in Radionetics. Such activities resulted in net cash outflows of approximately $574.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the net cash outflows of approximately $200.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 due to the increase in purchases of investment securities in 2024.

Financing activities.    
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 billion and $388.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities during 2024 and 2023 resulted from proceeds received from the sale of common stock and cash received from the exercise of stock options, both of which increased in 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investment securities of $1.4 billion. Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our existing capital resources, together with investment income, will be sufficient to satisfy our current and projected funding requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, our forecast of the period through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:

•
the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of, our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;

•
the costs of and our ability to obtain clinical and commercial supplies for our current product candidates and any other product candidates we may identify and develop;

•
the costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates, including commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is approved;

•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;

•
the costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;

•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;

•
the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our preclinical and clinical activities increase; 

•
the timing and the extent of any Australian Tax Incentive refund and future grant revenues that we receive;

•
the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any product candidate is approved;

80

•
our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products;

•
the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;

•
costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire;

•
the funding of any co-development arrangements we enter into; and

•
our ability to participate in future equity offerings by Radionetics.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves.

ATM Offerings

In August 2019, we entered into the 2019 Sales Agreement with the Sales Agents, under which we could, from time to time, sell up to $150.0 million of shares of our common stock through the Sales Agents pursuant to the 2019 ATM Offering. The 2019 ATM Offering was terminated upon the filing of our Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR on June 21, 2024.

On June 21, 2024, we entered the 2024 Sales Agreement with the Sales Agents, under which we may, from time to time, sell up to $350.0 million of shares of our common stock through the Sales Agents pursuant to the 2024 ATM Offering. We are not obligated to, and we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to, make any sales of the shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement. The 2024 Sales Agreement may be terminated by either Sales Agent (with respect to itself) or us at any time upon 10 days’ notice to the other parties, or by either Sales Agent, with respect to itself, at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse change. We will pay the Sales Agents a commission for their services in acting as agent in the sale of common stock in an amount equal to 3% of the gross sales price per share sold. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 1,344,865 shares of common stock in the 2019 ATM Offering for net proceeds of approximately $40.6 million, after deducting commissions.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 1,223,775 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2019 ATM Offering for net proceeds of approximately $43.4 million, after deducting commissions. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 928,912 shares of common stock pursuant to the 2024 ATM Offering for net proceeds of approximately $48.3 million, after deducting commissions.

Equity Offerings

On September 15, 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,441,648 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $30.59 per share. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $328.5 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of approximately $21.5 million.

On February 27, 2024, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with certain investors named therein, or the Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Purchasers in the Private Placement an aggregate of 8,333,334 shares of its common stock at a price of $42.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $350.0 million, before deducting offering expenses payable by us. The Private Placement closed on March 1, 2024. On March 19, 2024, we registered the resale of the shares issued and sold in the Private Placement, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement entered into with the Purchasers, dated February 27, 2024.

On October 10, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $50.00 per share, which included 1,500,000 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $542.8 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs of approximately $32.2 million.

Headquarters Lease

On September 9, 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for laboratory and office space in San Diego, California, or the 2022 Lease (see "Note 6" to the consolidated financial statements). On December 18, 2023, we moved our corporate headquarters to the new facility.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities consist of cash held in readily available checking and money market accounts as well as short-term debt securities. We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and market prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of United States interest rates. However, because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a sudden hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Foreign Currency

We conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than our U.S. dollar functional currency. These transactions give rise to cash flows and monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar; the value of these amounts are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are forecasted or originated until the time the cash settlement is converted into U.S. dollars.

We contract with vendors, CROs and investigational sites in several foreign countries, including countries in South America, Europe and the Asia Pacific. As such, we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements. We do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Additionally, our subsidiaries in Australia and Switzerland expose us to foreign currency exchange risk. The functional currency of CAPL is the United States dollar, and the functional currency of CPEG is the Swiss Franc. We believe this exposure to be immaterial and, to date, we have not incurred any material adverse effects from foreign currency changes on these contracts. As of December 31, 2024, the impact of a theoretical 10% change in the exchange rate of either the Australian dollar or the Swiss Franc would not result in a material gain or loss.

Inflation Risk

Inflationary factors, such as increases in the cost of our materials, supplies, and overhead costs may continue to adversely affect and  may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, we may experience some adverse effect if inflation rates continue to rise. Significant adverse changes in inflation and prices in the future could result in material losses.

Item 9A. Control
s and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our chief

82

executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

As of December 31, 2024, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

BDO USA, P.C., the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was engaged to attest to and report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in its report below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Stockholders and Board of Directors

Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

San Diego, California

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Item 9A, Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

San Diego, California

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Clinical Trial Accruals

As described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, clinical trial activities are accrued and expensed based on estimates of the period in which services and efforts provided by contract research organizations (“CROs”) and other third parties. Estimates are determined by reviewing cost information provided by CROs, other third-party vendors and internal clinical personnel, and contractual arrangements with CROs and the scope of work to be performed. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $3.1 million in clinical trial accruals, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet.

We identified the estimation of clinical trial accruals as a critical audit matter. Management’s judgment was required in estimating the progress of services and the associated costs incurred used to determine the accrued liabilities for clinical trial expenses. Auditing clinical trial accruals was especially challenging due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address the matter.

F-
2

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:

•
Testing management’s process for estimating clinical trial accruals by: (i) obtaining and inspecting certain agreements and amendments and (ii) confirming total clinical costs incurred and total amounts billed with certain third-party vendors.

•
Testing the completeness of the Company’s clinical trial accruals by: (i) evaluating internal materials and publicly available information (such as press releases and public databases that track clinical trials) and (ii) testing invoices received after year-end for certain third-party vendors.

CRINETICS PHARMACEUTICALS

Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements

1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Description of Business
Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2008 and based in San Diego, California. The Company is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors. In January 2017, the Company established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Crinetics Australia Pty Ltd (“CAPL”), in order to conduct various preclinical and clinical activities for its development candidates. In September 2024, the Company established Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Europe GmbH ("CPEG"), a wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary which was formed, among other things, to conduct various development, regulatory and pre-commercialization activities for our product candidates in Europe.
Our lead product candidate is paltusotine, which is in clinical development for the treatment of acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome associated with neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs.  Our second product candidate is atumelnant (formerly CRN04894), which is in clinical development for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or CAH, and patients with either Cushing's disease or Ectopic ACTH Syndrome, or EAS.
Principles of Consolidation and Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, CAPL, and CPEG. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The functional currency of  CAPL is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date except for nonmonetary assets, which are remeasured at historical foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the date of transaction. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and remeasurement are reported in other income (expense), in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and were not material for all periods presented.

The functional currency of CPEG is the Swiss Franc. Assets and liabilities from CPEG are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date while financial statement elements representing revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are translated at the using a weighted average exchange rate. 
The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and have been immaterial to date.
Liquidity

From inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to drug discovery and development and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. The Company has a limited operating history and the sales and income potential of the Company’s business and market are unproven. Successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the Company’s cost structure. The Comp
any has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception and has an accumulated deficit of $
952.1
 million as o
f December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
$
1.4
 billion 
in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, which the Company believes is sufficient to meet its funding requirements for at least the next 
12
 months.
The Company expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and believes it will need to raise substantial additional capital to accomplish its business plan over the next several years. The Company plans to continue to fund its losses from operations and capital funding needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. If the Company is not able to secure adequate additional funding, the Company may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm the Company’s business, results of operations and prospects. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available in the future.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements relate to accrual of research and development expenses, valuation of stock-based awards, fair values of financial instruments, revenue recognition, and the assumptions underlying the determination of the estimated incremental borrowing rate for the determination of the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets. Estimates are based on historical experiences or on forecasts, including information received from third parties and various other factors that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates
.

Investment in Radionetics
In October 2021, the Company, together with other investors, announced the formation of Radionetics Oncology, Inc. ("Radionetics").
The Company first analyzes its investment in another entity to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation. An entity is considered a VIE if (1) the entity does not have enough equity to finance its own activities without additional support, (2) the entity’s at-risk equity holders lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or (3) the entity is structured with non-substantive voting rights. VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, which is the entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE. Variable interests in a VIE can be contractual, ownership, or other financial interests. The Company re-assesses its investment upon reconsideration events to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case the Company would consolidate the VIE.
If it has been determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over the VIE, the Company accounts for the unconsolidated investment under the equity method of accounting.

Fair Value Measurements
The accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions about risk and the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s current financial assets, restricted cash and current financial liabilities are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company recorded the derivative asset (see "Note 9") and investment securities (see "Note 4") at fair value.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in readily available checking and money market accounts, as well as short-term debt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Restricted cash represents cash held as collateral for the Company’s facility leases and is reported as a long-term asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Cash and cash equivalents are considered Level 1 investments.

F-
10

Investment Securities
Our investment in debt securities have been classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value as determined based upon quoted market prices or pricing models for similar securities at period end. Investments with contractual maturities less than 12 months at the balance sheet date are considered short-term investments. Investments with contractual maturities beyond one year are also classified as short-term due to the Company’s ability to liquidate the investment for use in operations within the next 12 months.
The Company elected the practical expedient to exclude the applicable accrued interest from both the fair value and amortized costs basis of available-for-sale securities for purposes of identifying and measuring an impairment. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s accounting policy is to not measure an allowance for credit loss for accrued interest receivable and to write-off any uncollectible accrued interest receivable as a reversal of interest income in a timely manner, which the Company considers to be in the period in which the Company determines the accrued interest will not be collected.
Realized gains and losses on investment securities are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold and are included in other income (expenses), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company has not realized any significant gains or losses on sales of available-for-sale debt securities during any of the periods presented. Interest income is recognized when earned and is included in interest income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, as are the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts on investment securities.

Effective January 1, 2023, at each balance sheet date, the Company assesses available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether the unrealized loss or any potential credit losses should be recognized in net loss. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through net loss. For available-for-sale securities that do not meet the criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the severity of the impairment, any changes in interest rates, underlying credit ratings, and forecasted recovery, among other factors. The credit-related portion of unrealized losses, and any subsequent improvements, are recorded as an allowance in interest income. There have been no impairment or credit losses recognized during the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
Unrealized gains and losses that are not credit-related are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets
.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant risk on its cash balances due to the financial position of the depository institution in which those deposits are held. Additionally, the Company has established guidelines regarding approved investments and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain safety and liquidity.

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the arrangement. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets. Leases with a term longer than 12 months that are determined to be operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the accounting commencement date of the arrangement. The Company accounts for each separate lease and non-lease component as a single lease component. When the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, an incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at accounting commencement dates in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would expect to pay to borrow over a similar term, and on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, insurance, taxes or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses its leases to determine whether the arrangements contain lease incentives.

If a lease is modified, the modified contract is evaluated to determine whether it is or contains a lease. If a lease continues to exist, the lease modification is determined to be a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional

F-
11

right-of-use asset that is not included in the original lease and the lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right-of-use asset. A lease modification that results in a separate contract will be accounted for in the same manner as a new lease. For a modification that is not a separate contract, the Company will reassess the lease classification and incremental borrowing rate us
ing the modified terms and conditions and the facts and circumstances as of the effective date of the modification and recognize the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability for the modified lease as an adjustment to the corresponding operating lease right-of-use asset.
Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment consist of leasehold improvements, and lab and various other equipment. Such assets are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. The Company estimates its useful lives of its lab and other equipment as follows: lab equipment – 
three
 to 
five years
; office equipment - 
three 
to 
five years
; computer and software – 
three years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the associated lease.

Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures that materially extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets (or asset group) may not be fully recoverable.
Factors considered in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset (or asset group) are less than its carrying amount. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment loss recognized is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on future cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the asset (or asset group). 
 The Company has 
no
t recognized any impairment losses in any of the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition
The Company has generated revenue from licensing arrangements and supply agreements. The Company recognizes revenues when, or as, the promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract, assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct and identifies those that are performance obligations. The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company has entered into licensing and collaboration agreements that mainly include the following: (i) upfront considerations; (ii) payments associated with achieving certain milestones; and (iii) royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales, if any.

The Company has also entered into a manufacturing and supply arrangement that includes reimbursements of costs plus a pre-determined margin.
At the inception of a collaboration arrangement, the Company first assesses whether the contractual arrangement is within the scope of The Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 (“ASC 808”) to determine whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity and involves two (or more) parties that are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activity. Then the Company determines whether the collaboration arrangement in its entirety represents a contract with a customer as defined by ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue From Contracts with Customers
 ("ASC 606"). If only a portion of the collaboration arrangement is potentially with a customer, the Company applies the distinct good or service unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 to determine whether there is a unit of account that.
At the initiation of an agreement, the Company analyzes each unit of account within the contract to determine if the counterparty is a customer in the context of the unit of account.

F-
12

The Company considers a variety of factors in determining the appropriate estimates and assumptions under the arrangements, such as whether the elements are distinct performance obligations, whether there are observable standalone prices, whether the license is functional or symbolic, and whether the Company is acting as the agent or principal. The Company evaluates each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied and recognized as revenue at a point in time or over time.

At the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, the Company uses judgment to estimate the amount of milestone payments, which is a variable consideration, to include in the transaction price using the most likely method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur, then the estimated amount is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the Company's or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are not included in the transaction price until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint and, as necessary, adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price. Any adjustments will be recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.
The Company develops estimates of the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. Variable consideration that relates specifically to efforts to satisfy specific performance obligations is allocated entirely to those performance obligations. Other components of the transaction price are allocated based on the relative standalone selling price, over which management has applied significant judgment. The Company determines the standalone selling price for license-related performance obligations using a market approach, which may include assumptions such as forecasted revenues, development timelines, discount rates and probabilities of success. The Company estimates the standalone selling price for the data exchange performance obligation (see "Note 8") by forecasting the expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation plus a predetermined margin.
In the case of a license that is a distinct performance obligation, the Company recognizes revenue allocated to the license from non-refundable, up-front fees at the point in time when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee can use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other distinct or combined obligations, the Company uses judgment to assess the nature of the performance obligation to determine whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. If the performance obligation is satisfied over time, then the Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company has used the cost-to-cost measure of progress because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, which is considered an input method. The Company uses judgment to estimate the total cost of these performance obligations, which include subcontractors' costs, labor, materials, other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. The Company evaluates these cost estimates and the progress each reporting period and, as necessary, the Company adjusts the measure of progress and related revenue recognition.
Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized at the later of when the subsequent sale or usage occurs or the performance obligation for which some or all of the sales-based milestones and royalties have been allocated to has been satisfied or partially satisfied.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits and stock-based compensation for individuals involved in R&D efforts, as well as consulting expenses, third-party R&D expenses, laboratory supplies, clinical materials and overhead, including facilities and depreciation costs, offset by the Australian Tax Incentive discussed below. R&D expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in R&D are capitalized until the goods or services are received and are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Costs 
incurred under contracts with contract research organizations ("CROs") that conduct and manage the Company’s clinical trials are also included in R&D expenses. The financial terms and activities of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expense levels. Clinical trial activities are accrued and expensed based on estimates of the period in which services and efforts provided by CROs and other third parties. Estimates are determined by reviewing cost information provided by CROs, other third-party vendors and internal clinical personnel, and contractual arrangements with CROs and the scope of work to be performed. If the amounts that the Company is obligated to pay under its clinical trial agreements are modified (for instance, because of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), the

F-
13

Company 
adjusts its accruals accordingly on a prospective basis. Revisions to contractual payment obligations are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.
Australian Tax Incentive
CAPL is eligible to obtain a cash refund from the Australian Taxation Office for eligible R&D expenditures under the Australian R&D Tax Incentive Program (the “Australian Tax Incentive”). The Australian Tax Incentive is recognized as a reduction to R&D expense when there is reasonable assurance that the relevant expenditure has been incurred, the amount can be reliably measured and that the Australian Tax Incentive will be received. The Australian Taxation Office has a recapture right for a period of four years.
The Company recognized reductions to R&D expense o
f $
43,000
 and $
0.8
 million f
or the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. There was no reduction to R&D expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 for the Australian tax incentive.
Patent Costs
All costs incurred for the filing of patent applications are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss when inc
urred, as the recoverability of these expenses is uncertain.
Stock-Based Compensati
on
Stock-based compensation expense represents the estimated grant date fair value of the Company’s equity awards, consisting of stock options, restricted stock units and shares issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, recognized over the requisite service period of such awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis.  The Company estimates the fair value of all stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Restricted stock units are valued using the grant date stock price. For stock awards for which vesting is subject to performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable, or the performance condition has been achieved.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

The Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, management would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense, and any accrued interest and penalties would be included within the related tax liability.  No such costs were recorded during the three years ended December 31, 2024
.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is comprised of the Company’s net loss and the unrealized gains or losses on the Company’s available for sale investment securities for all periods presented. The cumulative amount of unrealized gains and losses is reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). There were no tax effects for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the

F-
14

net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods. Dilutive common stock equivalents are comprised of common stock subject to repurchase and stock options outstanding under the Company’s stock option plan. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding as inclusion of the potentially dilutive securities on loss per share would be antidilutive.
Potentially dilutive securities (in common stock equivalent shares) not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be anti-dilutive are as follows (

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ASU 2023-07
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting

(Topic 280)
 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
(“Topic 280”), which modifies the disclosure and presentation requirements of reportable segments. The amendments in the update require the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. The amendments also require disclosure of all other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. Additionally, the amendments require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Lastly, the amendment requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. The Company adopted this standard for its 2024 annual consolidated financial statements and interim consolidated financial statements thereafter and has applied this standard retrospectively for all prior periods presented in the financial statements (see "Note 13").

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
ASU 2023-09
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
”. ASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

ASU 2024-03
On November 4, 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, which requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities ("PBEs"). The ASU does not change the expense captions an entity presents on the face of the income statement; rather, it requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified categories in disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for all PBEs for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

The Company reviewed its investment holdings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and determined that the decrease in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and as the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Therefore, there were 
no
 allowances for credit losses as of December 31, 
2024 and 
2023. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized $
51,000
, $
0
, and ($
86,000
), respectively, of realized net gains (losses) in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities was $
8.3
 million and $
3.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company did not write off any accrued interest receivable in any of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Investment Securities

The Company holds investment securities that consist of highly liquid, investment grade debt securities. The Company determines the fair value of its investment securities based upon one or more valuations reported by its investment accounting and reporting service provider. The investment service provider values the securities using a hierarchical security pricing model that relies primarily on valuations provided by an industry-recognized valuation service. Such valuations may be based on trade prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or valuation models using inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs), such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, and broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures.

Derivative Asset
On October 15, 2021, the Company received a warrant (the "Radionetics Warrant") to purchase the greater of 
3,407,285
 additional shares of Radionetics common stock or the number of additional shares of Radionetics common stock that would allow the Company to maintain an aggregate equity interest of 
22
% of the fully diluted capitalization of Radionetics. The estimated value of the Radionetics Warrant is based on valuations provided by a third-party valuation specialist using unobservable inputs due to little to no market data (Level 3 inputs).

In August 2023, the Company exercised the Radionetics Warrant to purchase 
3,407,285
 shares of Radionetics common stock with an exercise price of $
0.00001
 per share, and also cancelled its existing right to maintain an aggregate interest of 
22
% of the fully diluted capitalization of Radionetics. There were no material changes in the inputs or the total valuation of the Radionetics Warrant in 2023 prior to its exercise and cancellation. Upon exercise, the Radionetics Warrant of $
0.7
 million was derecognized (see "Note 9").
During the year 
ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $
0.6
 million of i
ncome in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the change in value of the Radionetics Warrant.

6. OPERATING LEASES
In February 2018, the Company entered into a non-cancellable operating lease, as amended in March 2018, for a facility in San Diego, California (the "2018 Lease"). The 2018 Lease has an initial term of 
seven years
 which expires in 
August 2025
, and the Company has an option to extend the term of the 2018 Lease for an additional 
five years
, 
a termination option subject to early termination fees and an option to sublease the facility. The 2018 Lease is subject to base lease payments and additional charges for common area maintenance and other costs and includes certain lease incentives and tenant improvement allowances. The Company’s estimated incremental fully collateralized borrowing rate of 
8.0
% was used in its present value calculation as the 2018 Lease does not have a stated rate and the implicit rate was not readily determinable.
In 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for laboratory and office space in San Diego, California (the "2022 Lease").

F-
19

Under the terms of the 2022 Lease, the Company's expected future monthly minimum lease payments of $
0.5
 million, with six months of rent abatement in the first year, start on the earlier of (i) the date which is ten (10) months after substantial completion of demolition work, or (ii) the date of the substantial completion of improvements and first occupancy for business purposes, and the term expires on the date immediately preceding the one hundred thirty-seventh (137th) monthly anniversary of this lease payment start date. Lease payments are subject to annual 
3
% increases.
 The Company is also responsible for certain operating expenses and taxes during the term of the 2022 Lease. The 2022 Lease provides the Company with specified tenant improvement and landlord work allowances. 
The Company has (i) two options to extend the term of the 2022 Lease for an additional period of five (5) years each, and (ii) a right of first offer on adjacent space to the new facility, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2022 Lease.
 The 2022 Lease commenced in 2023 when the building was ready and available for its intended use. As of the date of the recording of the 2022 Lease, the Company is not reasonably certain that these options will be exercised. In September 2023, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in connection with the 2022 Lease. 
The Company recorded $
47.0
 million for the Right-of-use asset obtained in exchange for the 2022 Lease.
In December 2023, the Company entered into a lease amendment to the 2022 Lease that moved the initial payment date and start of the hundred thirty-seventh month from September 2023 to November 2023. The amendment was a modification that did not result in a new contract as the modification did not provide the Company additional right-of-use assets. As a result, the Company recorded a $
0.7
 million reduction to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s estimated incremental fully collateralized borrowing rate of 
8.6
% was used in its present value calculation as the 2022 Lease does not have a stated rate and the implicit rate was not readily determinable. The rate was determined using a synthetic credit rating analysis.
Under the terms of the 2018 Lease and 2022 Lease, the Company provided the lessors with irrevocable letters of credit in the amounts of $
0.5
 million and $

8.  REVENUE RECOGNITION
Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co., Ltd
On February 25, 2022, the Company and Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co., Ltd. ("Sanwa"), entered into a license agreement (the “Sanwa License”) whereby the Company granted Sanwa an exclusive license to develop and commercialize paltusotine in Japan.
Under the Sanwa License, Sanwa has the right to receive data obtained by the Company through certain paltusotine studies. The Company assessed the Sanwa License and concluded that Sanwa is a customer within the agreement. Sanwa will assume all costs associated with clinical trials and regulatory applications associated with these processes in Japan. Further, the Company retains all rights to develop and commercialize the product outside Japan. The Company also granted Sanwa the right to purchase supply of paltusotine for clinical and commercial requirements at cost plus a pre-negotiated percentage which was a market rate and therefore not a material right.

The Company determined that its performance obligations under the Sanwa License comprised the license and data exchange. Certain professional services, such as the Company's participation on committees, were deemed to be immaterial to the context of the contract.

In exchange, the Company received a $
13.0
 million nonrefundable, upfront payment and will be eligible to receive up to an additional $
25.5
 million in milestone payments related to the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial goals. In addition, upon market approval of paltusotine in Japan, the Company will be eligible to receive certain sales-based royalties. Initially, the Company deter
mined that the transaction price amounted to the upfront payment of $
13.0
 million. During the year ended
 December 31, 2024
, the C
ompany achieved a $
1.0
 million milestone for the first indication of the development milestones and as of
 December 31, 2024, t
he Company updated its estimated transaction price to $
14.0
 million and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $
0.4
 million during year ended 
 December 31, 2024
. As there have been no sales to date, no sales-based milestones or royalties were recognized to date. Further, using the most-likely-method, the other developmental milestone payments continue to be considered fully constrained.
The control of the license was transferred to Sanwa at the inception of the contract and the Company does not have an ongoing performance obligation to support or maintain the licensed intellectual property. Revenue allocated to the data exchange obligation is recognized over time using the cost-to-cost measure as this method represents a faithful depiction of progress toward the ongoing paltusotine studies in the U.S. and related data transfer. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis as the Company is the principal.

Deferred revenue consisted of the following (

On June 14, 2022, the Company and Sanwa, entered into a clinical supply agreement (the "Sanwa Clinical Supply Agreement") whereby the Company is responsible for manufacturing and supplying certain materials to Sanwa for specified activities under the Sanwa License. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023
 and 2022, the Company recognized $
0.1
 million, $

of revenues from the Sanwa Clinical Supply Agreement in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Cellular Longevity, Inc., doing business as Loyal
On March 24, 2023, the Company and Cellular Longevity Inc., doing business as Loyal ("Loyal") entered into a license agreement (the “Loyal License”) whereby the Company granted Loyal an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CRN01941, a somatostatin receptor type 2 agonist, for veterinary use. In exchange the Company received a $
0.1
 million nonrefundable, upfront payment and preferred stock in Loyal valued at approximately $
2.0
 million. 
The Company will also

be 
eligible to receive certain single-digit sales-based royalties if the licensed intellectual property is approved for veterinary use.

No
 revenue was recognized during the year ended
 December 31, 2024. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $
2.1
 million of revenues from the Loyal License at the inception of the contract in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the shares of Loyal preferred stock issued and to be issued to the Company valued at $
2.0
 million is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Loyal preferred stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost less impairment. The Company assesses equity securities without a readily determinable fair value for changes in observable prices each period, noting none for the 
year ended December 31, 2024

9. INVESTMENT IN RADIONETICS
Investment in Radionetics

In October 2021, the Company entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the "Radionetics License") with Radionetics Oncology, Inc. ("Radionetics"), in which the Company granted Radionetics an exclusive worldwide license to its technology for the development of radiotherapeutics and related radio-imaging agents in exchange for 
50,500,000
 shares of common stock of Radionetics, which represented an initial majority stake in Radionetics of 
64
%, and a warrant (the "Radionetics Warrant") to purchase the greater of 
3,407,285
 additional shares of Radionetics common stock or the number of additional shares of Radionetics common stock that would allow the Company to maintain an aggregate equity interest of 
22
% of the fully diluted capitalization of Radionetics.

Radionetics is a variable interest entity ("VIE") due to having insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company evaluated whether it is the primary beneficiary of Radionetics by evaluating Radionetics’ key activities: (1) conducting research and development, (2) making financing decisions, and (3) determining the strategic direction of Radionetics. Decisions about research and development activities are made by unanimous vote of members of the research and development committee, in which no individual party has unilateral decision-making power. Decisions about financing and strategic direction rest with Radionetics’ board of directors, and no party was determined to be in control, given the Radionetics board of directors was comprised of three members for which each of Crinetics, 5AM Ventures ("5AM") and Frazier Healthcare Partners ("Frazier") were entitled to appoint and replace, as needed, their board designee, and a fourth member mutually agreed upon by the other three board members. Radionetics’ management was separate from the Company and was determined by Radionetics’ board of directors. As the Company did not control any of Radionetics' key activities, it was not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and did not consolidate the financial results of Radionetics.

The Company accounts for its investment in Radionetics common stock under the equity method of accounting due to its ability to exercise significant influence. The Company records its share of Radionetics income (loss) outside of operations in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss on a quarterly lag. The Company's equity method investment in Radionetics was written down to zero during the first quarter of 2022 as a result of the allocation of the Company’s share of losses of the investee.

In August 2023, Radionetics completed a refinancing that included a number of transactions that were negotiated by the Company as a package (the “August 2023 Radionetics Transaction”). In connection with the August 2023 Radionetics Transaction, (1) the Company exercised the Radionetics Warrant to purchase 
3,407,285
 shares of Radionetics common stock with an exercise price of $
0.00001
 per share, (2) the Company exchanged 
32,344,371
 shares of Radionetics common stock for Radionetics preferred stock on a one-for-one basis, (3) the Company invested $
5.0
 million to purchase 
14,404,656
 shares of preferred stock in Radionetics along with other new and existing investors who participated in the financing, and (4) the Company and Radionetics agreed to amend the Radionetics License to include additional sales milestones of up to $
15
 million. Radionetics’ convertible notes held by other investors were also converted to Radionetics preferred stock and certain Radionetics common shares held by other investors were cancelled in connection with the August 2023 Radionetics Transaction.
The August 2023 Radionetics Transaction was a VIE reconsideration event. The Company determined that Radionetics continues to be a VIE due to Radionetics having insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company also reevaluated whether it is the primary beneficiary of Radionetics and noted there were no changes to Radionetics’ key activities or the conclusion that the Company does not control any of these activities. The size of Radionetics’ board of directors was increased from four to six members. Crinetics, 5AM and Frazier are each entitled to appoint and replace, as needed, their board designee, the fourth member is Radionetics’ CEO, and the fifth and sixth members must be mutually agreed upon by the other four board members. All changes to board composition are subject to shareholder approval with common and preferred shareholders having equal votes. Radionetics’ management continues to be entirely separate from the Company and determined by the Radionetics’ board of directors. As the Company does not control

F-
22

any of Radionetics' key activities, it is not the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate the financial results of Radionetics. Accordingly, the Company continues to account for its investment in Radionetics under the equity method of accounting due to its ability to exercise significant influence.
The Company determined that its preferred stock investment in Radionetics represents in-substance common stock. The preferred stock investment is substantially similar to common stock in that it does not have a substantive liquidation preference since the preferred stock will participate in substantially all of Radionetics losses, the conversion ratio for preferred stock into common stock is on a one-for-one basis without any significant restrictions or contingencies, and the preferred stock lacks redemption features, among other factors.

The Company is not obligated to fund losses incurred by Radionetics. The Company’s $
5.0
 million purchase of preferred stock in the August 2023 Radionetics Transaction was alongside new and existing investors and did not fund previous losses.
In connection with the August 2023 Radionetics Transaction, the Company exercised the Radionetics Warrant, which had a fair value of $
0.7
 million, and purchased $
5.0
 million of preferred stock. These transactions resulted in a $
5.7
 million increase in the Company’s investment in Radionetics. As a result of the August 2023 Radionetics Transaction, the Company experienced net dilution in its ownership of Radionetics from a 
55
% ownership stake in Radionetics common stock to a 
31
% combined ownership stake in Radionetics common and preferred stock. No gain was recorded upon dilution since cumulative losses that had been suspended exceeded the gain on dilution. Additionally, in December 2023, Radionetics completed a financing to sell additional shares of preferred stock to other investors.

The amendment to the Radionetics License in connection with the August 2023 Radionetics Transaction did not result in additional revenue at the time of modification and the sales-based milestone and royalty payments will only be recognized when the milestones or sales occur.
In June 2024, the Company amended the Radionetics License to reduce the number of development targets.  Following the amendment to the Radionetics License, ownership of the non-licensed targets reverted back to the Company and the Company is eligible to receive total potential sales milestones in excess of $
300.0
 million and single-digit royalties on net sales.  In July 2024, Radionetics announced the formation of a strategic partnership with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly.  Under the terms of the agreement, Radionetics was entitled to receive a $
140.0
 million upfront cash payment and Lilly obtained the exclusive right to acquire Radionetics for $
1.0
 billion upon conclusion of an exercise period. During the exercise period, Radionetics will continue to build out a proprietary pipeline of therapeutic assets. As of December 31, 2024, the Company owned approximately 
25
% of Radionetics consisting of common and preferred stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded equity method losses of $
0.5
 million, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, as a result of the allocation of the Company’s share of Radionetics eligible losses, which is recorded on a quarterly lag. As of December 31, 2024 the Company's investment in Radionetics was written down to zero. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s investment in Radionetics of $
0.5
 million is recorded as a long-term asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Other Items
R. Scott Struthers, Ph.D., the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, serves as chairman of the Radionetics board of directors. Pursuant to such arrangement, Dr. Struthers receives consideration in the form of both equity and a $
50,000
 annual retainer for his service as a board member of Radionetics. As of December 31, 2024, Dr. Struthers has an approximately 
1.3
% ownership stake in Radionetics consisting of common stock.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
0
 and $
0.1
 million, respectively, due from Radionetics for reimbursement of certain expenses paid on behalf of Radionetics. These amounts are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company received reimbursements from Radionetics
 of $
0.1
 mill
ion, $
0.1
 million, and $
0.4
 million, respectively.

The weighted-average fair value of awards under the ESPP during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 was $
22.09
, $
11.49
 and $
9.39
 per share, respectively.
The key assumptions used in determining the fair value of equity awards, and the Company’s rationale, were as follows: (i) 
Expected term -
 the expected term for stock options represents the period that the stock options are expected to be outstanding and has been estimated using the simplified method, due to limited historical exercise behavior. The expected term using the simplified method is an average of the contractual option term and its vesting period; the expected term for awards granted under the ESPP represents the term the awards are expected to be outstanding; (ii)
 Expected volatility -
 Beginning in 2023, the Company determined that the volatility of its own market-traded shares best represents the expected volatility based on available historical data and, therefore, the expected volatility assumption for stock-based awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2024 is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. During 2022, the expected volatility assumption was based on volatilities of a peer group of similar companies in the biotechnology industry whose share prices are publicly available. The Company computed the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the period equivalent to the expected term of the Company’s stock-based awards; (iii) 
Risk-free interest rate -
 the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities that approximate the expected terms of awards; and (iv) 
Expected dividend yield -
 the expected dividend yield assumption is 
zero
 as the Company has never paid dividends and has no present intention to do so in the future.

Restricted stock units are valued using the closing sale price of our common stock on the date of grant.

As of December 31, 2024
, unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to option awards, restricted stock units, and ESPP was $
142.3
 million, $
35.0
 million and $
3.9
 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 
1.8 
years, 
2.7 
years and 
1.4
 years, respectively.

12. INCOME TAXES
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state jurisdictions, Australia and Switzerland; however, as it has operated at a loss since inception, it has not paid income taxes in any of the jurisdictions in which it has operated. At December 31, 2024
, the Company had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss ('NOL') carryforwards of approximately $
431.2
 million, $
253.9
 million and $
3.1
 million, respectively. The federal loss carryforwards generated after 2017 of $
424.9
 million will carryforward indefinitely and can be used to offset up to 
80
% of future annual taxable income, while those loss carryforwards generated prior to 2018 begin expiring in 2035, unless previously utilized. $
2
 million of the state loss carryforwards will carryforward indefinitely. The other state loss carryforwards begin expiring in 2035, unless previously utilized. The Company's foreign loss carryforwards do not expire. The Company also has federal and California R&D credit carryforwards and federal Orphan Drug Credits totaling $
30
 million, $
14.9
 million, and $
26.3
 million, respectively. The federal R&D credits begin to expire in 
2030
, unless previously utilized, while the state credits do not expire. The federal Orphan Drug credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2040, unless previously utilized.
The Company’s NOL and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to a substantial annual limitation upon future utilization as a result of ownership changes that could occur in the future pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383. 
These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an 'ownership change' as defined by the tax code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 
50
 percent of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. During 2020, the Company completed a study to assess whether an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 had occurred for the time period prior to July 15, 2020.
 The study identified several such ownership changes during the study period, which resulted in limitations on the annual utilization of the Company's NOL and credit carryforwards, or the "Tax Attribute" carryforwards; however, the study findings also indicated that none of the Company's Tax Attribute carryforwards generated during the study period would expire solely as a result of annual limitations on the utilization of such Tax Attribute carryforwards. The Company updated the study for 2022 and 2023 and did not identify any additional ownership changes. Future ownership changes could still occur which might place further limits on the Company's ability to utilize its Tax Attribute carryforwards.
The Company’s federal income tax returns from 2021 forward, state income tax returns from 2020 forward, and its Australian tax returns beginning in 2021 are subject to examination by  tax authorities; however, the Company's tax attribute carryforwards such as NOLs and R&D credits generated in closed years remain subject to adjustment by the taxing authorities until the future tax years in which those attributes are utilized are closed to statute. No such audits are underway.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be

generated to use existing deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of available evidence, including the Company's history of operating losses, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company’s net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established by the Company to fully offset these net deferred tax assets.

Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in unrecognized tax benefits would not have any effect on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company does not foresee any material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. There have been 
no
 decreases in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements or expiration of statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The Company’s policy is to recognize the interest expense and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. The Company had 
no
 accrual for interest or penalties on its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and has 
no
t recognized interest and/or penalties in its consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 as the unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which no cash tax liability has been reduced.
In response to the pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020.  The CARES Act, among other things, includes tax provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer’s social security payments, net operating loss utilization and carryback periods, modifications

F-
28

to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.  The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Deferred income taxes have not been provided for undistributed earnings of the Company’s consolidated foreign subsidiaries because the Parent entity would not be required to include the distribution into income as the amount would be tax free. The Company has no foreign withholding tax liability as of December 31, 2024 as a result of losses in foreign subsidiaries.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a US shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.  The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740 No. 5. Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only.  We have elected to account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred.

13. SEGMENT REPORTING
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the CODM in making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, assessing performance and monitoring budget versus actuals. The Company's CODM is its founder and chief executive officer. The Company views its operations and manages its business as one operating and reportable segment as the Company has devoted substantially all of its resources to drug discovery and development activities through conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials associated with its programs, all of which aim to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors, as outlined in the table below. The Company's operating segment derives its revenues from licensing arrangements (see “Note 8”). The CODM assesses performance based on consolidated net loss as reported on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheet as total consolidated assets. Further, segment depreciation expense and segment asset additions are consistent with consolidated amounts reported within the consolidated statement of cash flows given the Company's operations are aggregated within a single reportable segment. Substantially all of the Company’s assets and sources of revenues are located in the United States. The total segment amount of equity method investments for the segment is also consistent with the consolidated amount of equity method investments reported within the consolidated balance sheet.
Segment revenue and significant segment expenses which are regularly reported to the CODM are included within the table below and are reconciled to consolidated net loss:
