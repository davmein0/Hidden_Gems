Item 1.    Business
Overview
WD-40 Company is a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products that solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world. The Company was founded in 1953 and is headquartered in San Diego, California.
For more than four decades, we sold only one product, WD-40
® 
Multi-Use Product, a multi-purpose maintenance product which acts as a lubricant, rust preventative, penetrant and moisture displacer. Over the last several decades, we have evolved and expanded our product offerings through both research and development activities and through the acquisition of several of our smaller brands worldwide. As a result, we have built a family of brands and product lines that
 deliver high quality performance at a good value to our end users.
We currently market and sell our products in more than 176 countries and territories worldwide primarily through hardware stores, automotive parts outlets, industrial distributors and suppliers, mass retail and home center stores, value retailers, grocery stores, online retailers, warehouse club stores, farm supply stores, sport retailers, and independent bike dealers.
Our sales come from two product groups – maintenance products and homecare and cleaning products. Maintenance products are sold worldwide in markets throughout North, Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Europe, India, the Middle East and Africa. Homecare and cleaning products are sold primarily in North America, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Australia. We sold certain assets of the homecare and cleaning product brands in the EIMEA segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. See Note 3. Assets Held for Sale of the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 15 of this report for additional information on this sale. These brands are included in the results of operations in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year 2025. We continue to make available for sale certain assets of our homecare and cleaning product portfolios in the Americas segment and are expecting the sale of these portfolios in fiscal year 2026. This potential sale will allow us to focus on our core, higher-margin maintenance products that are included in our strategic framework. The principal driver of our sales growth is focused on our maintenance products and making them available in more places, for more people, who we expect will find more uses, more frequently.

Our future is guided by a long-term four-by-four strategic framework tied to our purpose and our values. There are two main elements of our strategic framework.
The first element of our four-by-four strategic framework, which we refer to as our Must-Win Battles, focuses on increasing sales of our maintenance products. Our four Must-Win Battles include:
1.
growing WD-40 Multi-Use Product sales through geographic expansion;
2.
growing sales and gross margin through the premiumization of WD-40 Multi-Use Product;
3.
growing the WD-40 Specialist product line through category leadership; and
4.
accelerating our capabilities in building our brand digitally and maximizing our global digital commerce presence.
The second element of our four-by-four strategic framework, which we refer to as our Strategic Enablers, focuses on operational excellence. Our four Strategic Enablers include:
1.
ensuring a people-first mindset where we can attract, develop and engage outstanding employees;
2.
building a sustainable business for the future;
3.
achieving operational excellence in supply chain; and
4.
driving productivity through enhanced systems.
These elements are the foundation of our four-by-four strategic framework and are where we will continue to focus our time, talent and resources.
We continue to be focused and committed to innovation and renovation of our products. We see innovation and renovation as important factors to the long-term growth and enhancing the sustainability of our brands and product lines. We intend to continue to work on future products, product lines, product packaging, and product delivery systems, as well as promotional innovations and renovations to expand our product portfolio, build a more sustainable future, and to help us grow. We are also focused on expanding our current brands in existing markets with new product development. Our research and development team supports new product development and current product improvement for our brands. Over the years, the impact of our research and development team on most of our brands and products has been reflected through our innovation. Key innovations for our products include, but are not limited to, WD-40 EZ-Reach Flexible Straw

, WD-40 Smart Straw
®
, WD-40 Trigger Pro
®
, WD-40 Specialist

, WD-40 Specialist

 Degreaser & Cleaner EZ-Pods, WD-40
®
 Precision Pen, WD-40 BIKE
®
, 3-IN-ONE RVcare
®
 and 3-IN-ONE
®
 Professional Garage Door Lube.
Our homecare and cleaning products in the Americas and Asia-Pacific segments are considered harvest brands, which continue to provide positive returns but are becoming a smaller part of the business as sales of the maintenance products grow with the execution of our four Must Win Battles within our strategic framework. We have continued to sell products within these brands but with a reduced level of marketing investment over time.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality. However, it is common for our sales to fluctuate from period to period or year to year due to various factors including, but not limited to, new or lost distribution, the timing of customer orders particularly in distributor markets, the number of product offerings carried by a customer and the level of promotional activities and programs being run at customer locations. New or lost distribution occurs when we gain or lose customers, when we gain or lose store count for a customer or when our products are added to new locations within a store or removed from existing locations. From time to time, as part of new product offering launches, we may gain access to entirely new distribution channels. The number of product offerings refers to the number of brands and/or the number of products within each of those brands that our customers offer for sale to end users. The level of promotional activities and programs relates to the number of events or volumes of purchases by customers in support of off-shelf or promotional display activities. Changes in any one of these three factors or a combination of them can cause our sales levels to increase or decrease from period to period. Promotional activities can also be impacted by customers adjusting to price increases and other market disruptions. It is also common and/or possible that we could lose distribution or product offerings and 
4
Table of Contents
experience a decrease in promotional activities and programs in one period and subsequently regain this business in a future period. We are accustomed to such fluctuations and manage this as part of our normal business activities.
Manufacturing
We outsource our finished goods manufacturing directly or through our marketing distributors to various third-party manufacturers. We or our marketing distributors use contract manufacturers in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, the U.K., Italy, Poland, Australia, China, the Middle East, South Korea and India.  The Company has minimum purchase obligations that primarily consist of contractual volume commitments with certain third-party packagers. See Note 14. commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 15 of this report for additional information on minimum purchase obligations. We also formulate and manufacture concentrate used in our WD-40 products at certain of our own facilities and at third-party contract manufacturers.
In addition to the commitments to purchase products from contract manufacturers described above, we may also enter into commitments with other manufacturers from time to time to purchase finished goods and components to support innovation or supply chain initiatives.
Sources and Availability of Components and Raw Materials
We rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers, including single or sole-sourced suppliers, for certain of our raw materials, packaging, product components and other necessary supplies. Where possible and where it makes business sense, we work with secondary or multiple suppliers to qualify additional supply sources. Historically, we have been able to obtain adequate capacity and raw materials. The primary components and raw materials for most of our products include specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, which are manufactured from commodities that are subject to market price fluctuations. The availability of these components and raw materials is affected by a variety of supply and demand factors, including global market conditions, tariffs imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments, plant capacity utilization, and natural disasters. We have historically experienced input cost inflation that impacted the cost of certain raw materials and freight services. As a result, we took actions to increase prices with our customers to help mitigate some of these inflationary pressures. We also implemented cost savings initiatives to mitigate those pressures. Our business results depend on the effective management and remedy of any supply disruptions. While we expect these components and raw materials to continue to be readily available in the future, we have developed sourcing alternatives and risk mitigation plans.
Research and Development
We recognize the importance of innovation and renovation to our long-term success and are focused on and committed to research and new product development activities, primarily in our maintenance product group. Our product development team engages in consumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. The product development team also leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers. In addition, the research and development team engages in activities and product development efforts which are necessary to ensure that we meet regulatory requirements for the formulation of our products. The research and development team also helps shape our environmental goals and business objectives by innovating and implementing sustainable practices and products. Our research and development team currently conducts global testing at a laboratory facility that we lease in New Jersey.
Competition
The markets for our products are highly competitive and influenced by large retailers with significant negotiating power. Current trends among these large retailers include increased demand for new innovative products and marketing, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and to deliver products within shorter lead times. Our products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels, competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space. Competition in international markets varies by country. We are aware of many competing products, some of which sell for lower prices or are produced and marketed by companies with greater financial resources than those of our Company. We rely on the awareness of our brands among end users, the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers, product innovation and renovation and our multiple channel distributions as our primary strategies. New products and our entry into new markets typically encounter intense competition, which may require significant investments in advertising and promotional activities. When a new product achieves end user acceptance, ongoing advertising and promotional support may be required to maintain its relative market position.
