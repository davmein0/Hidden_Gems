Strategic Growth
We have a long history of growth through strategic acquisitions, including:
•
Our September 2023 acquisition of the Webhelp business (“Webhelp”), a leading provider of CX solutions, including sales, marketing, and payment services, with significant operations and client relationships in Europe, Latin America, and Africa;  
•
Our July 2022 acquisition of ServiceSource International, Inc. (“ServiceSource”), a global outsourced go-to-market services provider that delivered business-to-business (“B2B”) digital sales and customer success solutions; 
•
Our December 2021 acquisition of PK, a leading CX design engineering company that created pioneering experiences to accelerate digital outcomes for their clients’ customers, partners and staff; and 
•
Our October 2018 acquisition of Convergys Corporation, a customer experience outsourcing company that added scale, diversified our revenue base, and expanded our service delivery capabilities.\
Our strategic acquisitions have strengthened our position as a global technology and services leader by expanding our scale in the digital IT services market and creating one of the most robust, well-balanced global footprints in the industry. Our disciplined approach to growth has strengthened our value proposition for our clients by broadening our offering of artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions, digital capabilities, and high-value services.
We trace our roots to 2004 when SYNNEX Corporation, now known as TD SYNNEX Corporation (“TD SYNNEX”), acquired BSA Sales, Inc., a company with 20 employees focused on helping clients through outsourced sales and marketing services. In 2006, TD SYNNEX combined New York-based Concentrix with BSA Sales under the Concentrix name, with the goal of bringing technology and innovation into businesses to help clients reimagine and design the next generation of experiences. Concentrix Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in December 2009. In December 2020, Concentrix was separated from TD SYNNEX through a tax-free distribution of all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to TD SYNNEX stockholders (such separation and distribution, the “spin-off”). As a result of the spin-off, we became an independent public company and our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “CNXC” on December 1, 2020.

Our Market Opportunity
Our clients must transform and continually evolve their systems in response to increased competition and to meet the demands of consumers and employees. To meet these growing demands, our clients are looking to large solutions and technology providers, such as Concentrix, to automate their systems and provide professional support to address complexities beyond the scope of automation. We are a leader in next-generation CX technology and a trusted partner to leading global brands, driven by a focus on innovation, which we believe will increase our total addressable market as we grow across new and existing markets. 
We offer a unique combination of technology and services and deliver our solutions globally at scale.

Industry Trends
•
Technological Innovation
.  Emerging technology is driving change within our industry and shaping the demands of our clients. Advancements in areas such as digital services, GenAI, and machine learning

Table of Contents 

(“ML”) are further changing our markets and our clients’ markets while opening new avenues for growth and opportunities for us to better serve our clients. These technologies provide clients the opportunity to interact more effectively with their customers and employees and improve experiences by automating processes, optimizing customer journeys to reach faster solutions, enabling personalized engagement across multiple platforms, and focusing human engagement on the most complex interactions. 
•
Importance of Customer Experience
.  
We believe customer experience is a strategic imperative for enterprises today. Data, analytics, and digital solutions have reshaped the ways enterprises interact with their customers and internal stakeholders. As a result, enterprises are modernizing how they manage the customer experience across all channels of communication. The market has evolved from customer relationship management solutions that act as a cost cutting measure toward end-to-end management solutions that create value throughout the entire customer lifecycle at an appropriate cost. 
•
Empowered Consumers and Users
.  Modern consumers are discerning and have come to expect a high level of care and responsiveness from their service providers. Old paradigms have shifted as increasingly competitive markets, easily accessible crowd-sourced information, and self-service GenAI solutions have empowered consumers to unprecedented levels. As consumers demand more and have an increasing number of alternatives, companies must differentiate on how they manage their customer relationships. This shift is driving the market toward consumer-centric solutions that reduce customer churn and promote brand loyalty.
•
Mission Critical Nature of Cybersecurity
.  Technological innovation coupled with the proliferation of smart devices and mobile connectivity is generating sensitive data at scale. At the same time, the avenues for access have become numerous, and an increasing number of malicious actors are becoming more sophisticated and active. Data security is paramount in an environment where external intrusion, improper access, or carelessness can compromise customers and businesses. Businesses require scalable, industry-leading data protection and security to avoid reputational and operational risks in an environment characterized by the threats and benefits of free-flowing information.
•
Evolving Role of People
. The skill set required of customer-facing employees is shifting as enterprises continue to place increased importance on CX and automation of lower complexity contacts continues. Contacts in the voice and chat channels are increasingly complex and driving a trend of longer customer engagements, requiring individuals to have a more robust skill set. However, the transition of lower complexity support to online and self-support options, driven by heavy automation and the increased use of new technologies, reduces volumes in the voice channel. Despite growth in digital channels, we expect the human element will continue to be important in our industry, as focus shifts from routine service to “last-mile” support requiring human-touch to deliver a stronger customer experience. In our view, attracting and retaining skilled talent that can adapt to the evolving focus of customer engagements requires a diverse and inclusive workplace that supports staff wellness. 
•
Enterprise Preferences Driving Vendor Consolidation
.  Enterprises have become increasingly global. As their scope of business increases, enterprises require partners that can serve their needs by rapidly deploying solutions and new technology consistently across multiple geographies and channels. Enterprises therefore prefer vendors with scale and end-to-end capabilities and a deep knowledge of their business and industry that can be a one-stop shop and are consolidating existing relationships to vendors with scale to achieve their business objectives and pursue cost savings. 
•
Market Fragmentation Driving Industry Consolidation
. 

We operate in a fragmented marketplace characterized by numerous vendors offering a variety of services across different levels of the value chain. Our competitive landscape of solutions providers includes core CX solutions, adjacent markets like consulting and design, business process services, and data and analytics, and digital IT services. Market share across this competitive landscape is highly dispersed with thousands of vendors participating in different portions of the market and no single provider or small number of providers holding a significant share of the total addressable market. As client preferences continue to evolve in line with enterprise preferences, we anticipate that the market will undergo further consolidation.

Legacy Solutions Have Many Limitations
.

As executives look to successfully navigate digital transformation and manage their customers’ experience across a wider variety of channels, unsophisticated providers and solutions often fail to meet customers’ needs. Currently there is a limited set of providers with end-to-end, global offerings of scale in the marketplace. The fragmentation of the market and, for many industries, high regulatory hurdles create additional complexity as most providers are small, niche, or local players. These issues are compounded by a lack of sufficient investment in cybersecurity, creating exposure to regulatory, reputational, and operational risks. These pain points, coupled with the prevalence of providers offering legacy solutions that fail to address the demands of the modern consumer, create an opportunity for large-scale, global end-to-end solutions providers.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with a competitive advantage:
•
Market Leader with a Differentiated Brand and Value Proposition
:  We strive to have a compelling brand and reputation as a leading provider of solutions and technology that shape the customer experience. We have a differentiated combination of global scale, local reach, technological expertise, end-to-end solution capabilities and full lifecycle services, and we are also an industry leader in cybersecurity best practices. We are widely recognized as a leading provider of CX solutions and technology, garnering industry attention via 176 industry awards in fiscal year 2024. Third-party researchers have also taken note of our leading global practice with Everest Group Research distinguishing us as a leader for the 9
th
 consecutive year in 2024, recognizing our GenAI platforms for improving CX and operational efficiency.
•
Strong Relationships with a Growing and Diversified Client Base
:

We partner with more than 2,000 clients worldwide. Leading global companies, including more than 155 Fortune Global 500 brands, rely upon our solutions and technology. We serve a wide variety of clients, extending across numerous verticals. Our end-to-end capabilities and global scale have enabled us to build long-lasting relationships with our largest clients spanning more than 16 years on average. Our commitment to our clients is our primary focus and has generated numerous accolades to date, including 53 client awards in fiscal year 2024.
•
Extensive Global Presence
:

We operate globally in 75 countries across six continents with the ability to conduct business in those locations in the languages that are relevant to our clients and their customers. We believe we are well-positioned to serve the largest global brands in nearly every market in which they operate. Our global footprint includes a strong presence in emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Egypt, Türkiye, China, South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, which provides an opportunity to grow with our clients in these regions. Our ability to create value for our clients across a global delivery platform has enabled us to be a partner of choice. 
•
Continued Investment in Technology
:

We believe that our focus on innovation and our investment in technology enables us to maximize value for our clients and differentiates us from our competitors. We have provided technology-infused CX solutions for nearly two decades. We have been at the forefront of developing CX solutions and technology that improve the customer experience and will continue to strive for this in the future. We have been a leader in our industry in advancements such as conversational virtual assistants, multichannel and augmented CRM, predictive analytics, emotion analytics, cognitive learning, AI, and GenAI and enjoy a first mover advantage. In September 2024, we introduced our iX suite of technology with the release of iX Hello, a GenAI-powered platform for creating virtual assistants. By proactively introducing technological innovation to our clients, we deepen our relations and are often rewarded with opportunities to expand our engagements and secure additional sources of revenue. 
Despite our focus on investing in technology, due to our size, scale, and the regular implementation of our technology-infused solutions, historically, our costs of developing, maintaining, and integrating new technologies were not material on a stand-alone basis. In fiscal year 2024, we increased our investment in technology to approximately 1% of revenue, including expenses related to the development of our new iX suite of technology, as well as pilot programs for clients related to the use of GenAI. We expect this level of investment will decrease over time.

•
Demonstrated History of Strategic Acquisitions
:

We have acquired and integrated more than 20 companies since our inception. We have a demonstrated ability to complete scale acquisitions, as well as revive underutilized assets and maximize their value, which we believe allows us to explore a broader scope of opportunities than our peers. In fiscal year 2023, we completed our combination with Webhelp, which significantly expanded our geographic footprint in Europe, Latin America, and Africa, and expanded the breadth and global reach of our higher-value services and digital capabilities. In fiscal year 2022, we acquired PK, which expanded our scale in the digital IT services market and supported our growth strategy of investing in digital transformation to deliver exceptional customer experiences, and ServiceSource, which complemented our B2B digital sales and customer success solutions.
•
Experienced Management Team

Through our acquisitions we have benefited from the addition of management talent, who have contributed valuable new perspectives and insights. Under our tenured management team, we have grown our revenue from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2014 to $9.6 billion in fiscal year 2024, while delivering strong profitability.

Our Growth Strategy 
The key elements to our growth strategy are: 
•
Expand and Deepen Relationships with Existing Clients
:  We have a well-established track record of cross-selling and offering additional solutions and premium services to sustain and grow our relationships with our existing clients.

We believe our global offerings and scale, efficiency, and technology generates incremental value for our clients with each process we manage, naturally driving our customers to spend more with us. Our focus on technological innovation, our deep understanding of our clients’ businesses, and our responsiveness to our clients’ needs position us for continued growth with our clients beyond traditional CX support. 
•
Relentlessly Innovate and Develop Technology Services and Solutions
:  We have developed innovative solutions for our clients, and we are focused on investing in technology. Investment in technology and digital transformation can enable more effective engagement with customers and improve the customer and user experience through increased automation, optimize customer journeys to reach faster solutions, enable personalized engagement across multiple platforms, and focus human engagement on the most complex interactions. For these reasons, we believe investments in disruptive technologies, applications, and services, including GenAI, will continue to be instrumental in driving better value for our clients and, over time, result in increased profitability.
•
Further Expand into Adjacent Markets
:

Our marketplace continues to expand, and we see significant opportunity for growth across adjacent markets. We believe we are a unique global provider of technology and services that can power our clients’ brand experiences and digital operations at scale. We expect to continue to provide our clients with a fully integrated offering that includes strategy and design, data and analytics, and enterprise technology. We have strengthened our presence in adjacent markets through recent acquisitions, including PK in fiscal year 2022 and Webhelp in fiscal year 2023, and through significant investments across emerging technologies, including the launch of our iX suite of AI and GenAI products in 2024. As our industry evolves, we will continue to invest in new technologies and faster growing markets to further sustain long-term growth.

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
:  We have made targeted acquisitions to increase our technology expertise, enter new verticals and geographies, and increase our scale, including our acquisitions of the IBM Customer Care Business, Convergys Corporation, PK, ServiceSource, and Webhelp. Our market remains highly fragmented and we believe that our acquisition strategy enhances and augments our growth avenues. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue complementary, value enhancing acquisitions. 
•
Invest in Emerging Markets
:

We have invested in delivery operations in emerging, high-growth markets such as India, Brazil, Egypt Türkiye, China, South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand. We expect to continue to strategically invest in similar markets to be well-positioned to grow with our clients in the regions and countries where they are growing and cost-effectively serve global brands in multiple time zones.
Our Clients
In fiscal year 2024, we served more than 2,000 clients across various verticals and geographies. Our strategic verticals include: technology and consumer electronics; retail, travel and e-commerce; banking; financial services and insurance; healthcare; communications and media; and other. We focus on developing long-term, strategic relationships with clients in verticals with certain characteristics, such as high growth, high transaction volume, high levels of compliance and security, and steep barriers to entry.
Sales and Marketing
We market our services through a sales force organized by industry vertical and geography. Our efforts may begin in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. The length of our sales cycle varies depending on the type of services work as well as whether there is an existing relationship with the client.
We have designated client partners or global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager is supported by process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology, and industry or subject matter expert teams to ensure we are offering our best possible solution to clients.
We strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management. These “C-level” relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives, and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns. We constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client.
Our Operations
We have global delivery capabilities that allow us to scale our operations with people, technology, and other resources from around the world, including language fluency, proximity to clients, and time-zone advantages. A critical component of this capability is our approximately 485 locations in 75 countries across six continents. Our service delivery centers improve the efficiency of our engagement teams through the reuse of processes, solution designs, and infrastructure by leveraging the experience of delivery center professionals. Services are provided from these global locations to customers worldwide in multiple languages. These services are supported by proprietary and third-party technologies to enable efficient and secure contacts through various channels including voice, chat, web, email, social media and other digital platforms, including automated bots, RPA, AI and GenAI. 
Our delivery and data centers are subject to annual certifications and attestation audits that include Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) version 4.0.1, ISO 27001:2022, ISO 22301:2019,  and SOC 2 Type II. Our risk-based independent assurance requirements, as well as client requirements, help define the scope of these certification and attestation audits. Twenty-eight of our delivery centers around the world are certified to the COPC (Customer Operation Performance Center) Outsource Service Provider standard. For our healthcare clients, we have achieved HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) 11.2.0 certification. We also maintain a Level 3 CMMI version 1.3 certification for services and development for our major technology development centers globally. For IT service management (ITIL standard), we have more than 100 delivery centers that are ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 certified.

International Operations
In fiscal year 2024, approximately 88% of our revenue was generated by our non-U.S. operations. A key element in our business strategy has been to locate our service delivery centers in markets that are strategic to our client requirements and cost beneficial. We have operations in 75 countries across six continents, with a significant presence in the Philippines and India.
Sales and cost concentrations in international jurisdictions subject us to various risks, including the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which in turn can impact reported revenue and cost of revenue.
See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional financial information related to our international and domestic operations.
Seasonality
Our revenue and margins fluctuate with the underlying trends in our clients’ businesses. As a result, our revenue and margins are typically the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter. However, our results in a particular year may vary based on client transaction volume and macroeconomic factors. 

Information Technology
We invest in information technology systems, infrastructure, automation and security to enhance workforce management and enhance productivity. Our delivery centers employ a broad range of technology, including advanced network and computing platforms, digital switching, intelligent call routing and tracking, proprietary workforce management systems, case management tools, computer telephony integration, interactive voice response and advanced speech recognition, with multiple layers of embedded security. Our innovative use of technology, including automation, GenAI, and AI, enables us to improve our voice, chat, web and e-mail handling and personnel scheduling, thereby increasing our efficiency and enhancing the quality of the services we deliver to our clients and their customers. We are able to dynamically scale to respond to changes in our clients’ business volumes. Additionally, we use technology to analyze information and trends from our clients’ customer interactions to support quality of service and improve the customer journey and experience. See Item 1C. Cybersecurity for a discussion of our cybersecurity program.

Services, and WNS (Holdings) Limited, and digital IT services competitors, including Endava UK Ltd., EPAM Systems, Inc., Globant S.A., and Thoughtworks Holding, Inc.
In the future, we may face greater competition due to the consolidation of solutions providers. Consolidation activity may result in competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint, or more attractive pricing than ours. In addition, a client or potential client may choose not to outsource its business, by setting up captive outsourcing operations or performing formerly outsourced services for themselves, or may switch CX solutions providers.
Human Capital Resources
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent. Through ongoing staff development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and staff wellbeing, we strive to help our team in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work. 
As of November 30, 2024, we had approximately 450,000 full-time game-changers, of which approximately 90,000 were based in the Americas, approximately 235,000 were based in Asia-Pacific, and approximately 125,000 were based in EMEA. Except for a small portion of our team in certain countries, generally required by local regulations or brought in through acquisitions, our staff are not represented by labor unions, nor are they covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
A diverse team, including across backgrounds, genders and gender identities, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and lived experiences, is critical to our success and contributes to a work environment that promotes innovation in our pursuit of game-changing experiences for our clients. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our game-changers are encouraged to leverage their personal strengths and experiences to continually innovate and contribute to the development of new ideas and process improvements that drive better customer experiences and improved outcomes for our clients. Our commitment to these principles is set out in our Human Rights Policy, our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Policy, and our Code of Ethical Business Conduct, which require all of our game-changers to adhere to our dedication to an inclusive work environment that fosters respect for all of our team members.  
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts with our highly skilled and diverse board of directors and senior leadership team. Half of the members of our board of directors and more than 40% of our senior leadership team are women, and 20% of our board members are ethnic minorities. Our team also supports nine staff resource groups, including LGBTQ+, persons with disabilities, women, women in tech, military veterans, and black professionals, to promote a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chris Caldwell, has been named one of the best CEOs for Women and one of the best CEOs for Diversity multiple times by Comparably, a workplace culture and compensation website, and in 2024, Comparably recognized Concentrix management as one of the top leadership teams. 
Pay Equity and Total Rewards
People should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as a game-changer’s
 role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual 
game-changer
s, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. We have reviewed the compensation of our 
game-changers
 to ensure consistent pay practices by conducting a gender pay equity analysis comparing staff in the same role within a country or location.
We require a uniquely talented workforce and are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with and drives long-term stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.

Game-Changer Engagement
We pride ourselves on championing our people. Our company culture emphasizes the satisfaction and well-being of our game-changers and a diverse, engaged team. We regularly solicit the opinion and views of our game-changers through a staff satisfaction survey, the results of which inform key initiatives to support engagement and foster retention. The global participation rate for our most recent staff satisfaction survey in 2024 was approximately 84.0%, and our overall positive engagement rating (game-changers that gave a satisfaction score of 4 or 5) was approximately 79.4%. In 2024, we were honored with the number one spot on the Inspiring Workplaces Group’s Global Top 100 Inspiring Workplaces, which recognizes the most forward-thinking and people-first organizations in the world.  
Training and Development
Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to deliver exceptional services globally. We invest in staff career growth and provide game-changers with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. Front-line staff receive continual feedback and reinforcement from supervisors who provide coaching, often in real time, so that staff can more readily apply their training to assist our clients and their customers. In addition, our game-changers have access to more than 43,000 online courses and 1,080 learning paths through Concentrix University, our virtual learning platform, to develop skills specific to their current roles and promote ongoing career growth.
Health, Safety and Wellness
The physical health, financial stability, life balance, and mental health of our team is vital to our success. We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental well-being for all of our game-changers. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. We also provide access to Modern Health, a mental health and wellness benefit that offers one-on-one coaching, therapy, live and on-demand group sessions, meditations and programs, and other resources to our game-changers and their dependents. We take an integrated approach to helping our staff manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on mental health. 
Sustainability
We have a responsibility to improve the lives of our people and the health of our planet. Since we became a public company, we have maintained an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) program with direction and oversight from our board of directors. Following our combination with Webhelp, our updated ESG program seeks to use our global reach and the strength of our team of approximately 450,000 game-changers to create significant and sustainable improvements in five impact areas:
•
Our Planet: We are contributing toward a more sustainable planet by reducing our impact and by protecting and restoring the planet as we progress toward our goal of becoming net zero by 2050;
•
Our Game-changers: We elevate our game-changers’ experience by developing an inclusive and supportive workplace that prioritizes people’s wellbeing, personal growth, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging; 
•
Building Trust: We build and foster trust by acting with integrity in everything we do. Always. 
•
Innovation and Tech: We promote innovation and tech for good and drive positive change through creative solutions that address societal and environmental challenges; and
•
Our Communities: We empower and give back to our communities by strengthening and building resilient communities everywhere we operate, and by supporting the causes our game-changers are most passionate about.
We publish an annual Sustainability Report that outlines our long-term ESG goals and how these commitments align with the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations, and updates stakeholders on our progress toward these goals.
