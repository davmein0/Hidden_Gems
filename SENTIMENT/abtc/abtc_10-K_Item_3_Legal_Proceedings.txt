Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Sphere 3D Litigation

On April 7, 2023, Sphere
3D filed an action against Gryphon in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging claims for breach of the
Sphere MSA entered between the parties on August 19, 2021, and subsequently amended on December 29, 2021, as well as claims for breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of fiduciary duty.

On June 15, 2023, Sphere
3D filed an amended complaint in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which clarified certain of Sphere 3D’s prior allegations.
On June 28, 2023, Gryphon requested leave to file a motion to dismiss Sphere 3D’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which the Court granted on August 11, 2023. On August 18, 2023, Gryphon filed:
(i) its motion to dismiss Sphere 3D’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing; and (ii) its answer and counterclaims against Sphere 3D, asserting, among other things, that Sphere had breached the Sphere
MSA, breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in connection with that contract, acted negligently in connection with
a separate incident, and defamed Gryphon. Gryphon’s answer and counterclaims further asserted the defamation counterclaim against
Sphere 3D’s Chief Executive Officer, Patricia Trompeter, personally.

On September 20, 2023, Sphere
3D filed a second amended complaint in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which added a claim against Gryphon alleging that Gryphon’s
counterclaim for defamation against Sphere 3D violated New York’s anti-SLAPP law.

On October 6, 2023, Sphere
3D delivered a purported termination notice to Gryphon (the “Sphere 3D MSA Termination”) regarding the Master Service Agreement
(“MSA”) previously entered by the parties on August 19, 2021, and subsequently amended on December 29, 2021, largely on the
basis of the deficient allegations made by Sphere 3D in the Sphere 3D Litigation. On January 17, 2024, Gryphon filed an amended answer
with fourth amended counterclaims to Sphere 3D’s second amended complaint, in which, among other things, Gryphon alleged that Sphere
3D’s attempted termination of the Sphere MSA was wrongful and ineffective because it violated the express terms of the MSA. Gryphon
is also seeking relief based on Sphere’s repeated breaches of the exclusivity terms of the MSA. Gryphon intends to continue to
vigorously defend against the Sphere 3D Litigation, which it believes is without merit, and to aggressively pursue its counterclaims
against Sphere 3D for Sphere 3D’s repeated violations of the MSA.

On February 1, 2024, Gryphon
filed an amended answer and its own counterclaim against Sphere 3D. Gryphon’s counterclaim alleges that Sphere 3D flagrantly and
repeatedly breached the terms of the MSA, including, among other breaching conduct, entering into multiple bitcoin mining hosting agreements
with third-parties in violation of the MSA’s exclusivity clause and improperly terminating the MSA on October 6, 2023.

On March 25, 2024, Gryphon
filed a pre-motion letter with the Court seeking pre-judgment attachment of the equity shares in Core that Sphere 3D received as a result
of the Core Settlement (as defined below) to secure a judgment against Sphere 3D.

On June 27, 2024, during
a discovery conference, Sphere 3D agreed that it was not seeking to impose any liability against Gryphon for events that occurred in
late February 2023 whereby a hostile actor impersonated Sphere 3D’s chief financial officer in an email sent to both Sphere 3D
and Gryphon’s personnel and requested the transfer of bitcoin (worth approximately $560,000) from a Sphere 3D wallet controlled
by Gryphon.

Subsequent to December 31,
2024, on March 7, 2025, Gryphon and Sphere 3D entered into a settlement and release agreement on mutually acceptable terms. The Settlement
Agreement fully resolved all pending litigation between Gryphon and Sphere, and each party fully released the other party from any known
or unknown and unsuspected claims. The Settlement Agreement further provided that each party will bear its own costs in connection with
the litigation.

PPP Loan

On
April 21, 2020, the Company obtained a loan in the principal aggregate amount of $2.2 million (the “PPP Loan”) pursuant to
the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act, which was forgiven in full, by the SBA, on September 3, 2021.

On
February 5, 2024, the Company received a letter, dated January 25, 2024, from the SBA, on behalf of Key Bank, in which the SBA indicated
that, notwithstanding its prior notification of forgiveness, in full, of repayment of the PPP Loan, it was reviewing its prior determination
of forgiveness for potential reversal. Specifically, the SBA indicated that based on its preliminary findings, the SBA is considering
a full denial of the previously received forgiven amount based on the purported ineligibility of the Company to have received the PPP
Loan under the SBA loan programs because the Company, operating as Akerna at the time of the PPP Loan, provided software support to the
cannabis industry. The Company responded to the SBA on February 6, 2024, providing reasons as to why it believes it was eligible for
the PPP Loan, but has not received any further correspondence from the SBA, since that date, and the SBA has not made any financial demands.
The Company plans to continue to cooperate with any further inquiry from the SBA.

In
January 2024, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking information and documents about the PPP Loan. The
Company is cooperating with the inquiry. At this time, there has been no formal demand for return of the PPP Loan proceeds, and no formal
claim or lawsuit has been initiated against the Company.

Former CEO Litigation

As previously disclosed,
on September 17, 2024, Robby Chang was terminated as Chief Executive Officer and President of Gryphon for cause, with immediate effect,
by the Board. Mr. Chang remains a member of the Board.

On October 21, 2024, the
Company received notice that both it and Ivy Crypto, Inc., a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company, have been named as defendants
in a complaint filed by Mr. Chang in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada, alleging wrongful termination. The Company intends
to defend this matter vigorously.

On October 22, 2024, the
Board created a special committee to oversee the Company’s handling of the claim made by Mr. Chang, made up of Steve Gutterman,
Jimmy Vaiopoulos, Dan Tolhurst and Jessica Billingsley. The Company and Ivy Crypto, Inc. have served their Statement of Defense and the
parties have agreed to proceed with a mediation of the dispute to be held on May 5, 2025. The potential outcome cannot be determined
at this time.

Business Overview

Founded in October 2020,
Gryphon has traditionally been a bitcoin mining company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gryphon launched its mining operations in September
2021 upon the receipt of the first of 12 batches of 600 Bitmain S19j Pro Antminers. Gryphon’s current revenue model is to mine
and hold bitcoin, and then sell only the bitcoin that is necessary to pay its operating expenses and to reinvest in operational expansion.
The bitcoin that is sold to pay operating expenses and to reinvest in operational expansion is typically sold within 24-hours of receipt.

Gryphon operates approximately 9,660 bitcoin ASIC mining computers,
referred to as “miners,” from Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”) that Gryphon has installed at third-party
hosted mining data centers located in New York and Pennsylvania. Revenue generated by the mining of bitcoin is measured on a dollar per
megawatt-hour (“MWh”) basis and is variable based on the price of Bitcoin, the measure of difficulty, transaction volume and
global hash rates.

For the year ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, Gryphon mined approximately 334 and 739 bitcoins, respectively. While Gryphon does not have any plans to acquire digital
assets other than bitcoin, it may do so in the future.

The breakeven analysis is
computed by taking the cost of revenues for the given period and dividing that sum by the number of Bitcoin Equivalent Coins Generated
during the same period. For instance, in (2024 the $15,818,000 cost of revenues is divided by the 334 Bitcoin Equivalent Coins Generated,
resulting in an average of $47,359 per coin). The BTC Equivalent calculation labeled as “Total BTC Equiv” in the table, is
determined by combining Gryphon’s bitcoin-mined during the period with the bitcoin equivalent amount of revenue earned from the
Sphere MSA. To calculate the latter, the revenue earned from the Sphere MSA during the period is divided by the average bitcoin price
as quoted by the Principal Market for that same period (labeled as “MSA BTC Equiv” in the table). The breakeven analysis is
an operational metric that does not take capital expenditures or financing mechanics into consideration. The calculation only considers
direct operational costs, such as electricity and hosting. The mining equipment was originally financed primarily through equity capital
raises and cash flows resulting from the sale of bitcoin generating by mining operations. As of December 31, 2024, there were no financing
agreements outstanding related to financing of mining equipment.

The breakeven analysis is
a non-GAAP measure, similar to the way the gold industry reports gold-equivalent ounces to provide uniform measure of various revenue
streams from different commodities (such as gold, copper, nickel, etc.). Much like the gold industry, the purpose of this calculation
is to offer the reader a bitcoin-equivalent datapoint for Gryphon’s two revenue streams within the context of its primary revenue
stream. This enables readers to easily compare Gryphon’s operations with other bitcoin mining companies. By dividing the total
cost of revenues by the number of bitcoin-equivalent coins generated, one arrives at the breakeven point for total BTC equiv. Therefore,
if Gryphon sells a bitcoin at the same price, it would have achieved a breakeven.

The breakeven cost of mining
bitcoin is influenced primarily by two factors. First, the cost of electricity sourced from Gryphon’s hosting providers, which
encompasses a combination of pass-through market electricity prices and profit-sharing arrangements. Second, it is affected by the global
hashrate of the Bitcoin network. Over the twelve-month period through the fourth quarter of 2024, the cost of electricity plus the profit-sharing
arrangement in place with the hosting provider has fluctuated due to seasonality from $0.0720 per kilowatt hour in the fourth quarter
of 2023 to $0.0447 per kilowatt hour in the fourth quarter of 2024, reaching a high of $0.0905 per kilowatt hour during Q1 of 2024. In
addition, the global hashrate of the Bitcoin network has shown a consistent upward trend, with sequential increases of 21.6%, 19.0%,
6.8% and 4.3% over the last four quarters ending December 31, 2024. This increase in the global hashrate has led to fewer bitcoins being
mined for the same amount of energy consumption. The combined effect of these changes in the two key cost drivers has resulted in an
increase in the overall breakeven level as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.

Recent Developments

Blockfusion Agreement

On December 1, 2024, Gryphon
entered into a Co-Location Mining Services Agreement (the “Blockfusion Agreement”), with Blockfusion USA, Inc. (“Blockfusion”)
for hosting 3,780 of its bitcoin miners at Blockfusion’s facility in Niagara Falls, New York. Pursuant to the Blockfusion Agreement,
the Company is entitled to 12 MW of power at a cost of $156,000 per month, as well as certain other fees set forth in the agreement. At
signing, the Company paid an initial $156,000 facility fee. In addition, the Company will be required to (i) by January 31, 2025, maintain
a cash deposit or (ii) by January 27, 2025, an irrevocable standby letter of credit with Blockfusion’s energy provider, in each
case in the amount of $1,200,000. As of the filing date, the Company has not completed this payment and the amount is currently outstanding.
The Blockfusion Agreement has a term of twelve months and automatically renews for subsequent one-month terms, until terminated on thirty
days’ notice. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, the Company has delivered 3,996 bitcoin miners to Blockfusion.

51

Mawson Agreement

On January 3, 2025, Gryphon entered into a Master Co-Location Agreement
(the “Mawson Agreement”) with Mawson Hosting LLC (“Mawson”) with a right to host up to 5,880 miners in Mawson’s
facility in Midland, Pennsylvania. Pursuant to the Mawson Agreement, the Company is entitled to 20 MW of power at a cost of approximately
$23.50 per MW/hour paid monthly with a minimum fee of approximately $165,521 per month, as well as certain other fees set forth in the
agreement. The Mawson Agreement has an initial term of one year and may be terminated on sixty days’ notice. Subsequent to December
31, 2024, the Company has delivered 6,719 bitcoin miners to Mawson.

Anchorage Loan Agreement

On May 25, 2022, Anchorage
entered into the Anchorage Loan Agreement with Gryphon Opco, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which Anchorage
loaned Gryphon Opco the principal amount of 933.333333 bitcoin. Gryphon Opco’s obligations under the Anchorage Loan Agreement were
secured by certain equipment and software rights of Gryphon Opco and were guaranteed by Gryphon.

On October 25, 2024, Gryphon,
its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as applicable, and Anchorage entered into the New Anchorage Agreements to restructure the Anchorage
Loan and terminate the existing the Anchorage Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the New Anchorage Agreements, (i) approximately $9.1 million
of the Anchorage Loan was converted into shares of Common Stock, at an ascribed value of $1.10 per share, resulting in the issuance of
8,287,984 shares of Common Stock to Anchorage in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, (ii) approximately
$3.9 million of the Anchorage Loan was converted into warrants to purchase 3,530,198 shares of Common Stock, which warrants are exercisable
immediately, have an unlimited term and an exercise price of $0.01 per shar e(the “Pre-Funded Warrants”), in a private placement
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and (iii) the remaining $5 million of the Anchorage Loan was exchanged for a new $5
million loan (the “Restructured Loan”) pursuant to the New Loan Agreement.

Pursuant to the New Loan
Agreement:

●

the outstanding principal and interest are denominated in dollars;

●

the interest rate is 4.25% payable monthly;

●

Anchorage has been given a first priority lien on all of Gryphon and
    its subsidiaries’ assets;

●

covenants related to mining machine locations and covenant ratios in
    the Anchorage Loan Agreement have been removed; and

●

Anchorage may convert half of the outstanding principal at a price
    of $1.10 per share of Common Stock and the remaining half at a price of $1.50 per share of Common Stock.

52

The New Loan Agreement contains
customary representations, warranties and agreements by Gryphon, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the
Company and the purchasers, including for liabilities arising under the Securities Act, other obligations of the parties and termination
provisions. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Loan Agreement were made only for the purposes of such agreements
and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon
by the contracting parties.

Pursuant to the New Anchorage
Agreements, Gryphon also issued Anchorage the Warrants.

The Restructured Loan and
the Warrants cannot be converted or exercised, respectively, if Anchorage (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess
of 19.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of the New Anchorage Agreements after giving effect to such
conversion or exercise without the approval of Gryphon’s stockholders. Gryphon has agreed to seek such approval at its next annual
meeting of stockholders.

Mining revenues

Mining revenues decreased
to $20,539,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $21,052,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in mining revenues
of $513,000 is due to a combination of factors. The average value of bitcoin mined for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $66,000 compared
to $29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $37,000, or 128%. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately
8,800 miners compared to approximately 8,300 as of December 31, 2023. However, these increases in operational miners and revenue recognized
per bitcoin earned were offset by the increase in global hashrate as well as the 50% reduction in block rewards due to the halving event
in April 2024. .

During the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, the average daily global hashrate was 633.4 exahash and 381.4 exahash, respectively, an increase of 66%.

Management services

Management services revenue
decreased to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $873,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management services revenue
relates to the Sphere MSA, regarding which Sphere 3D delivered a termination notice to the Company on October 6, 2023. See Note 8 - Commitments
and Contingencies.

Cost of revenues

Cost of revenues increased
to $15,818,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $13,462,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $2,356,000
was primarily due to (i) an increase in the deployment of miners, (ii) an increase in Bitcoin network hashrate and (iii) higher energy
costs.

was due to (i) an increase of $301,000 for accounting and other related services, (ii) an increase in legal fees of $1,073,000 and (iii)
$388,000 of professional fees related to the Merger.

Investor and public relations
expenses increased to $4,088,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $0 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is
due to management hiring consulting firms to increase the Company’s public exposure as a result of the Merger. Included in the
$4,088,000 investor and public relations expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 is $1,884,000 of non-cash expense related to the
fair value of common stock issued to consultants.

Salaries and wages increased
to $1,337,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $1,061,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $276,000 is
due to compensation for three new directors, hiring one additional executive employee and estimated bonus accruals for the Company’s
officers.

Insurance expense increased
to $671,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $157,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase of $514,000 was attributable

Stock-based compensation expense

Stock-based compensation
expense increased to $1,588,000 for the year December 31, 2024, from a benefit of $152,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The
increase is due to a one-time forfeiture of stock-based compensation of $1,910,000 in connection with the termination of an employment
agreement in the prior year period.

Depreciation expense

Depreciation decreased to
$11,179,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $14,958,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The average remaining useful
life of the mining fleet as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 30 months and 55 months, respectively. Therefore, the depreciation
expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was reduced in comparison to the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Impairment of digital assets

Impairment of digital assets
decreased to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $275,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to the
implementation of ASU 2023-08 issued in December 2023.

Impairment of miners

Impairment of miners decreased
to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $8,335,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to the carrying
amount of the Bitcoin miners being equal to or below the fair market value of the asset group. As such, pursuant to ASC 360, the Company
determined no impairment losses occurred during 2024.

Unrealized gain on digital assets

As of January 1, 2024, the
Company implemented ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Topic 350-60) (“ASU 2023-08”): Accounting

Change in fair value of BTC Note

The Company has a note payable
denominated in Bitcoin, which is accounted for under the fair value method of accounting. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company
recognized an $8,058,000 decrease in the fair value of notes payable, compared to a $13,297,000 decrease for the year ended December
31, 2023. Under the fair value method of accounting, the Company is required to adjust the note to fair value as of each reporting period.
Since the note is denominated in Bitcoin, the fair value is calculated by multiplying the number of Bitcoin outstanding times the closing
price of Bitcoin as of the reporting period.

Interest expense

Interest expense increased
to $915,000 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $758,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The interest is paid with Bitcoin,

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024 and
2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $735,000 and $915,000, respectively, and an accumulated deficit of approximately $67,735,000
and $47,175,000, respectively. Through December 31, 2024, the Company financed its operations primarily through proceeds from the sales
of its equity securities through private placements, its at-the-market program as described below, borrowings pursuant to the Sphere
3D Note and the BTC Note and cash flow from its digital currency mining operations (including revenue received under the Sphere 3D MSA).

The Company believes that
its current levels of cash will not be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for its operations for at least the next 12 months.
The Company will require additional capital resources to fund its operations and pay its obligations as they come due over the next twelve
months. The Company may also need to implement a strategy to expand its business or other investments or acquisitions. The Company may
sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into a credit facility to satisfy its capital requirements. The sale of additional
equity securities could result in dilution to its shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service
obligations and could require the Company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict its operations. Financing
may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company if at all. Any failure by the Company to raise additional funds
on terms favorable to it, or at all, could limit its ability to expand its business operations and could harm its overall business prospects.

On June 10, 2024, the Company
filed a prospectus supplement for the offering, issuance and sale of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $70.0 million of common
stock that may be issued and sold under an at-the-market issuance sales agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Kingswood Investments,
a division of Kingswood Capital Partners, LLC, PI Financial (US ) Corp. and ATB Capital Markets USA Inc., each respectively acting as
sales agents, (the “ATM”). The Company has used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds from the ATM for general corporate
purposes, including without limitation, capital expenditures, funding potential acquisitions of additional new mining equipment, other
potential acquisitions, investments in existing and future Bitcoin mining projects and repurchases and redemptions of our common stock
and general working capital. The ATM will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the issuance and sale of all of the shares of the common
stock subject to the conditions set forth in the ATM or (ii) termination of the ATM as otherwise permitted thereunder. The ATM may be
terminated at any time by either the Company or any sales agent with respect to itself upon five days’ prior notice, or by the
sales agents at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse effect on us. As of March __, 2025,
approximately $63.5 million in capacity remains under the ATM.

of the Company, pursuant to which Anchorage loaned Gryphon Opco the principal amount of 933.333333 bitcoin. Gryphon Opco’s obligations
under the Anchorage Loan Agreement were secured by certain equipment and software rights of Gryphon Opco and were guaranteed by Gryphon.

On
October 25, 2024, Gryphon, its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as applicable, and Anchorage entered into the New Anchorage Agreements
to restructure the Anchorage Loan and terminate the existing the Anchorage Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the New Anchorage Agreements,
(i) approximately $9.1 million of the Anchorage Loan was converted into shares of Common Stock, at an ascribed value of $1.10 per share,
resulting in the issuance of 8,287,984 shares of Common Stock to Anchorage in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act, (ii) approximately $3.9 million of the Anchorage Loan was converted into warrants to purchase 3,530,198 shares of Common
Stock, which warrants are exercisable immediately, have an unlimited term and an exercise price of $0.01 per share, in a private placement
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and (iii) the remaining $5 million of the Anchorage Loan was exchanged for a new $5
million loan pursuant to the New Loan Agreement.

Pursuant
to the New Loan Agreement:

●

the outstanding principal and interest are denominated in dollars;

●

the interest rate is 4.25% payable monthly;

●

Anchorage has been given a first priority lien on all of Gryphon and
    its subsidiaries’ assets;

●

covenants related to mining machine locations and covenant ratios in
    the Anchorage Loan Agreement have been removed; and

●

Anchorage may convert half of the outstanding principal at a price
    of $1.10 per share of Common Stock and the remaining half at a price of $1.50 per share of Common Stock.

The
New Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Gryphon, customary conditions to closing, indemnification
obligations of the Company and the purchasers, including for liabilities arising under the Securities Act, other obligations of the parties
and termination provisions. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Loan Agreement were made only for the purposes
of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements, and may be subject to limitations
agreed upon by the contracting parties.

Pursuant
to the New Anchorage Agreements, Gryphon also issued Anchorage warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock, which warrants
are exercisable immediately, will expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The $1.50
Warrants were issued in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

59

The
Restructured Loan and the Warrants cannot be converted or exercised, respectively, if Anchorage (together with its affiliates) would
beneficially own in excess of 19.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of the New Anchorage Agreements
after giving effect to such conversion or exercise without the approval of Gryphon’s stockholders. Gryphon has agreed to seek such
approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual
results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing
basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable after taking into
account our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. Our actual results could differ from these
estimates.

We consider an accounting
estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the
time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or
use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined
above.

The critical accounting policies,
and the judgements, estimates, and assumptions associated with such policies, that we believe have the greatest potential impact on the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements	

From time to time, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards-setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the
FASB ASC are communicated through the issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”). The Company considers the applicability
and impact of all ASUs on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Described
below are ASUs that are not yet effective but may be applicable to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash
flows, or presentation thereof. As of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, there were no ASUs that management assessed
and determined to be applicable to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to the
Company’s results determined in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of
financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Company provides investors with
reconciliations from net loss to adjusted EBITDA as components of Management’s Discussion and Analysis. The Company defines
adjusted EBITDA as (a) GAAP net income (loss) plus (b) adjustments to add back the impacts of (1) depreciation and amortization, (2)
interest expense, (3) income tax expense (benefit) and (4) adjustments for non-cash and non-recurring items which currently include
(i) stock compensation expense, (ii) change in fair value of notes payable (iii) gain on restructuring of bitcoin denominated note
payable and (iv) unrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity securities. 

Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial
measure of performance under GAAP and, as a result, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements
prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction
with the Company’s Interim Reports on Form 10-Q and its Annual Reports on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management uses adjusted EBITDA and the supplemental information provided herein as a means of understanding, managing, and evaluating
business performance and to help inform operating decision making. The Company relies primarily on its consolidated financial statements
to understand, manage, and evaluate its financial performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.

Recently Adopted Pronouncements

On December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Topic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets. ASU 2023-08 requires entities to measure crypto assets that meet specific criteria at fair value with changes recognized in net income each reporting period. Additionally, ASU 2023-08 requires an entity to present crypto assets measured at fair value separately from other intangible assets in the balance sheets and record changes from remeasurement of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets in the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024. The adoption of the ASU 2023-08 was a $740,000 increase of our digital assets, as of January 1, 2024.

In November 2023, the FASB
issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (ASC Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The amendments require
the disclosure of significant segment expenses as well as expanded interim disclosures, along with other changes to segment disclosure
requirements. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2024. We have implemented the provisions of the ASU 2023-07. See Note 1.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.

Not applicable.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.

The independent registered
public accounting firm’s report and, consolidated financial statements listed in the “Index to Financial Statements”
on page F-1 of this Report are filed as part of this report and incorporated herein by this reference.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

On
April 26, 2024, as recommended and approved by the Audit Committee and the Board, the Company engaged RBSM LLP (“RBSM”) as
the Company’s independent public accounting firm to audit the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2024 and to review the Company’s quarterly consolidated financial statements for each of the quarters
ending March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024. RBSM previously served as the independent registered public accounting
firm of Ivy prior to the closing of the Merger.

61

For
the Company’s two most recent fiscal years, and in the subsequent interim period through the Dismissal Date, neither the Company
nor anyone on its behalf consulted with RBSM regarding: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either
completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, and neither a
written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that RBSM concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching
a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement
(as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v)
of Regulation S-K).

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange
Act”)), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation and as a result of the unremediated material
weaknesses described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of such period,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for accurate
and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management determined that
our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
as set forth below.

Management
’
s Annual Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive
and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

●

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
    and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

●

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

●

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
    of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

62

Management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013 Framework).

Based on this assessment,
management concluded that as of December 31, 2024, we have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

Material Weaknesses

A material weakness is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Pursuant to management’s
review of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management determined that the following
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and prevented management from concluding that our disclosure controls
and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report: not
effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Notwithstanding the identified
material weaknesses described above, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Report on Form 10-K
are fairly presented in all material respects in accordance with GAAP, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
certified that, based on their knowledge, the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material
respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented in this report.

Remediation

The Company is in the process
of developing a more comprehensive risk assessment process to identify emerging risks while working with outside counsel and third-party
vendors. The Company has implemented dual authorization controls for high-value transactions. The Company is in the process of developing
additional policies and procedures for key processes while hiring additional full time employees to mitigate any segregation of duties
risks for critical functions.  

Attestation Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

An attestation report on
our internal control over financial reporting by our independent registered public accounting firm is not included herein, because, as
a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from the requirement to provide such report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

During the most recently
completed fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of

Controls

Management recognizes that
a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of
a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under
all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

There are no family relationships

Composition of our Board of Directors

Our Board currently consists
of eight directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended, provide that the total
number of directors constituting the entire Board shall be seven directors; provided that, the total number of directors constituting
the entire Board of Directors may be changed to such number as may be fixed from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Board. Our Board is divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class
III directors, with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class serving a three-year term. The term of office
of the Class I directors, consisting of Steve Gutterman, Daniel Tolhurst and Heather Cox, will expire at our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders.
The term of office of the Class II directors, consisting of Brittany Kaiser and Rob Chang, will expire at our 2026 annual meeting of
stockholders. The term of office of the Class III directors, consisting of Jessica Billingsley, Dan Grigorin and Jimmy Vaiopoulos, will
expire at our 2027 annual meeting of stockholders. When considering whether directors have the experience, qualifications, attributes
or skills, taken as a whole, to enable our Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure,
the Board focuses primarily on each person’s background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in each of the
directors’ individual biographies set forth above. We believe that our directors provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills
relevant to the size and nature of our business.

Director Independence

As our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our determination
of the independence of directors is made using the definition of “independent director” contained in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2).
Our Board has affirmatively determined that each of Ms. Kaiser, Ms. Billingsley, Ms. Cox and Mr. Jimmy Vaiopoulos are “independent
directors,” as that term is defined in the Nasdaq rules. Under the Nasdaq rules, our Board must be composed of a majority of “independent
directors.” Additionally, subject to certain limited exceptions, our Board’s audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate
governance committees also must be composed of all independent directors.

Audit committee members must
also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. Under the rules of Nasdaq, a director will only
qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of that company’s board of directors, that person does not
have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

To be considered to be independent
for purposes of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his capacity
as a member of our audit committee, our Board, or any other committee of our Board: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting,
advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed
company or any of its subsidiaries.

Committees of the Board of Directors

Presently, our board of directors
has the following standing committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each
of the standing committees is composed solely of independent directors.

67

Audit Committee

We have established an audit committee of the Board of Directors. Mr.
Vaiopoulos, Ms. Kaiser and Ms. Billingsley serve as the members of our audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable
SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Mr. Vaiopoulos, Ms.
Kaiser and Ms. Billingsley are independent.

Mr. Vaiopoulos serves as
the chair of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our Board has determined that Mr. Vaiopoulos
qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules.

We have adopted an audit
committee charter, which details the principal responsibilities of the audit committee, including:

●

To assist board oversight of (i) the integrity of our financial statements,
    (ii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) our independent auditor’s qualifications and independence,

    independence of the Company’s independent auditors, including an evaluation of the lead audit partner; and to assure the regular
    rotation of the lead audit partner at the Company’s independent auditors and consider regular rotation of the accounting firm
    serving as the Company’s independent auditors.

●

To review and discuss with the Company’s independent auditors
    and management the Company’s quarterly financial statements and the disclosure under “Management’s Discussion and

    before such Form 10-Q is filed; and to review and discuss the Form 10-Q for filing with the SEC.

●

To review, approve and oversee any transaction between the Company
    and any related person (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) and any other potential conflict of interest
    situations on an ongoing basis, in accordance with Company policies and procedures, and to develop policies and procedures for the
    Committee’s approval of related party transactions.

●

To review with management and the Company’s independent auditors:
    (i) any major issues regarding accounting principles and financial statement presentation, including any significant changes in the
    Company’s selection or application of accounting principles; (ii) any significant financial reporting issues and judgments
    made in connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, including the effects of alternative GAAP methods;
    and (iii) the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives and off-balance sheet structures on the Company’s financial statements.

●

To assist and advise the Board and the Compensation Committee thereof
    in enforcing the Company’s executive compensation clawback policy and related laws, rules and regulations.

68

Compensation Committee

We have established a compensation
committee of our Board of Directors. The members of our compensation committee are Ms. Billingsley, Ms. Cox and Ms. Kaiser. Ms. Billingsley

of the compensation committee, including:

To review and approve the Company’s compensation programs and
    arrangements applicable to its executive officers, including without limitation salary, incentive compensation, equity compensation
    and perquisite programs, and amounts to be awarded or paid to individual officers under those programs and arrangements, or make
    recommendations to the Board regarding approval of the same. 

●

To determine the objectives of the Company’s executive officer
    compensation programs, identify what the programs are designed to reward, and modify (or recommend that the Board modify) the programs
    as necessary and consistent with such objectives and intended rewards.

●

To ensure appropriate corporate performance measures and goals regarding
    executive officer compensation are set and determine the extent to which they are achieved and any related compensation earned.

●

To at least annually review and approve the Company’s goals and
    objectives relevant to CEO compensation, evaluate the CEO’s performance in light of such goals and objectives, and determine
    and approve the CEO’s compensation level based on this evaluation.

●

To review and approve any new equity compensation plan or any material
    change to an existing plan where stockholder approval has not been obtained.

●

To assist management in complying with our proxy statement and annual
    report disclosure requirements;

●

To implement and enforce the Company’s executive compensation
    clawback policy and related laws, rules and regulations, including determining what constitutes “incentive-based compensation”
    and, if a clawback is triggered due to a financial statement restatement, the amount of any clawback.

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may select, retain and terminate independent legal counsel and other experts or consultants, as it deems
appropriate, without seeking approval of the Board or management, including the authority to approve the fees payable to such counsel,
experts or consultants and any other term of retention. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant,
external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including
the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

We have established a nominating
and corporate governance committee of the Board of Directors. The members of our nominating and corporate governance are Ms. Kaiser,
Ms. Cox and Ms. Billingsley. Ms. Kaiser serves as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee.

We have adopted a nominating
and corporate governance committee charter, which details the principal responsibilities of the nominating and corporate governance committee,
including:

●

The identification, evaluation and recommendation of qualified candidates
    to become Board members.

●

The oversight of the implementation of and monitoring compliance with
    the Company’s Code of Business Conduct (other than with respect to complaints regarding accounting or auditing issues).

●

Coordinating and overseeing Board, committee, and director evaluations.

●

Periodic review of the Company’s governance documents as appropriate.

The charter also provides
that the nominating and corporate governance committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of, and terminate, any
search firm to be used to identify director candidates, and will be directly responsible for approving the search firm’s fees and
other retention terms.

We have not formally established
any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying
and evaluating nominees for director, our Board of Directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience,
knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests
of our shareholders. Prior to our initial Business Combination, holders of our Public Shares do not have the right to recommend director
candidates for nomination to our Board of Directors.

69

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider

compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the
past year has served, as a member of the Board’s compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions)

involving members of our compensation committee or their affiliates.

Code of Ethics

We have adopted a code of
ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees (the “Code of Ethics”). We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics

are also able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC’s website at

Trading Policies

We have

Steve Gutterman Employment Agreement 

On
September 17, 2024, the Company entered into an executive employment agreement with Steve Gutterman (the “Gutterman Agreement”),
pursuant to which Mr. Gutterman serves as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reporting to the Company’s Board. The Gutterman
Agreement has a three-year term that may be renewed for successive one-year periods by written agreement.

71

The Gutterman Agreement provides
for (A) a $450,000 annual base salary paid in accordance with our normal payroll practices and which may be increased in the discretion
of our Board, but not reduced, (B) for 2024, a pro-rated bonus based on the Company’s and/or Mr. Gutterman’s achievement of
performance goals, with the sum of the 2024 and 2025 bonuses being no less than 40% of Mr. Gutterman’s base salary, (C) a target
annual bonus beginning in 2025 equal to 100% of base salary, with the actual amount of such bonus determined in the discretion of our
Board, based on the achievement of individual and/or company performance goals determined by our Board and payable on the date annual
bonuses are paid to our other senior executives, but in no event later than March 15th and conditioned upon Mr. Gutterman’s continued
employment through the payment date, (D) a target annual stock bonus beginning in 2025 equal to 100% of Mr. Gutterman’s base salary,
which may be paid in performance stock units or restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and which shall be subject to vesting conditions
following the grant of such units, (E) a recommendation to the Board that the Board make a sign-on equity grant valued at $1,000,000 in
the form RSUs, which will vest as to (1/3) of the RSUs (rounded down to the nearest whole share) (x) on each of the first two anniversaries
of the grant date and (y) upon the Company’s remediation of certain stock exchange listing qualification failures that exist as
of the effective date of the Gutterman Agreement, and (F) eligibility to participate in customary health, welfare, and fringe benefit
plans we provide to our employees.

The
Gutterman Agreement also provides Mr. Gutterman with the opportunity to earn an incentive bonus (the “Incentive Bonus”), which
will become payable, if ever, in tranches following the Company’s attainment of certain stock price and market capitalization goals.
The specific goals are as follows:

Company Stock Price Goal

Company
    Market

 Capitalization Goal

Amount of Incentive Bonus
 Payable for Achievement of
 Tranche Goals

Tranche 1

$2.50 based on 30-day VWAP

$150 Million

100% of Base Salary

Tranche 2

$2.50 based on 30-day VWAP

$250 Million

200% of Base Salary

Tranche 3

$5.00 based on 30-day VWAP

$500 Million

300% of Base Salary

Tranche 4

$10.00 based on 30-day VWAP

$1 Billion

500% of Base Salary

For
the avoidance of doubt, no Incentive Bonus tranche will become payable unless both the stock price goal and the market capitalization
goal for the applicable tranche are satisfied, and the market capitalization goal is attained simultaneously with the stock price goal.
Additionally, the Incentive Bonus may be earned in a change in control if the consideration paid per share of Company common stock exceeds
an Incentive Bonus tranche stock price goal and the total value received in the transaction exceeds an Incentive Bonus tranche market
capitalization goal. Under no circumstances may the performance goals for an Incentive Bonus tranche be achieved more than one time. The
Incentive Bonus, to the extent any tranche becomes payable, will be paid within thirty days of the attainment of the applicable goals,
subject to Mr. Gutterman remaining in continuous employment with the Company through each payment date.

All
bonuses payable under the Gutterman Agreement, except the stock bonus, may be paid in cash, Bitcoin, Company equity, or a mix of any of
the foregoing.

Under
the Gutterman Agreement, Mr. Gutterman will be entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits upon a termination of
his employment by the Company without “cause”, by Mr. Gutterman for “good reason” (each, as defined in the Gutterman
Agreement and collectively, a “Qualifying Termination”), that does not occur in connection with a change in control (i) the
Accrued Obligations (as defined in the Gutterman Agreement), (ii) Mr. Gutterman’s annual base salary, and (iii) the product of (x)
12 and (y) Mr. Gutterman’s monthly cost for health and welfare benefits pursuant to his elections under the Company’s health
and welfare benefit plans, as in effect on the termination date (collectively, the “Non-CIC Severance”).

72

The
Non-CIC Severance will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the effective date of a release but no later than 74 days
following Mr. Gutterman’s termination. If Mr. Gutterman incurs a Qualifying Termination within 30 days prior to or 12 months following
a change in control, then in addition to the Non-CIC Severance, Mr. Gutterman will be entitled to the following: (i) an amount equal to
0.5 times Mr. Gutterman’s target bonus, and (ii) acceleration and vesting on a prorated basis (performance goals will be assumed
to have been achieved at target) of each outstanding equity award held by Mr. Gutterman as of the termination date (but excluding the
Incentive Bonus) (collectively, the “CIC Severance”).

To
the extent payable in cash, the CIC Severance will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the effective date of a release,
but no later than 74 days after Mr. Gutterman’s termination date. The severance payments and benefits described above are subject
to Mr. Gutterman’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance
with his restrictive covenant obligations.

The Gutterman Agreement includes
certain restrictive covenants, which include non-solicitation and non-competition covenants during the term of the Gutterman Agreement
and for the 12 months following. Further, the Gutterman Agreement includes a “best pay” provision under Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code, pursuant to which any “parachute payments” that become payable to Mr. Gutterman will either be paid
in full or reduced so that such payments are not subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever
results in the better after-tax treatment to Mr. Gutterman.

Simeon Salzman Employment Agreement

On June 19, 2023, we entered
into an Executive Employment Agreement (the “Salzman Agreement”) with Simeon Salzman to serve as the Chief Financial Officer
of Gryphon (and, under certain circumstances, such other position as Gryphon’s Chief Executive Officer may designate), reporting
to our Chief Executive Officer. On July 29, 2024, Mr. Salzman informed the Company that he intended to resign on November 15, 2024, and
entered into a letter agreement that specified the terms and conditions of his planned separation from the Company. Subsequently, on September
26, 2024, Mr. Salzman and the Company rescinded Mr. Salzman’s resignation in connection with Mr. Salzman’s decision to remain
with the Company. In connection with such rescission, the Company and Mr. Salzman amended the Salzman Agreement. The terms of the amended
Salzman Agreement are described below.

Mr. Salzman receives a base
salary of $275,000 and is eligible to receive an annual bonus with a target of up to 50% of his then-current base salary. Mr. Salzman
received a time-based equity grant covering 390,800 Shares (the “Equity Grant”), vesting as follows (subject to Mr. Salzman’s
continued employment with the Company through the relevant vesting date): 1/6 of the Equity Grant will vest upon the 6-month anniversary
of the effective date of the Salzman Agreement and the remainder of the Equity Grant will vest in substantially equal quarterly installments
commencing with the first quarter following the 6 month anniversary of the effective date of the Salzman Agreement. The vesting of the
Equity Grant will be accelerated if Mr. Salzman is continuously employed through a change in control (excluding a reverse takeover transaction
or merger for the purposes of listing Gryphon on a public exchange). Mr. Salzman will be entitled to receive those benefits that are made
available to the other similarly situated executive employees, and will be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Upon the termination of the
Salzman Agreement during the our first two full financial reporting quarters by (a) Mr. Salzman for good reason (as defined in the Salzman
Agreement) or (b) by the Company without cause (as defined in the Salzman Agreement), then, subject to Mr. Salzman’s execution and
non- revocation of and compliance with a separation and release agreement in a form provided by the Company, the Company will pay Mr.
Salzman an amount equal to 3 months of his then-current base salary. Upon such a termination of the Salzman Agreement following the first
two full financial reporting quarters of the Company, the Company will pay Mr. Salzman an amount equal to (a) 12 months of his then-current
base salary, plus (b) Mr. Salzman’s then-current annual bonus target. 

Pursuant to the Salzman Agreement,
Mr. Salzman is subject to standard restrictive covenants, including a nondisparagement covenant and non-competition and customer and employee
non-solicitation covenants for the period of Mr. Salzman’s employment and for the six months thereafter.

73

Eric Gallie Employment Agreement 

On December 12, 2024, we entered
into a letter agreement (the “Gallie Agreement”) with Eric Gallie, pursuant to which Mr. Gallie will serve as the Company’s
Senior Vice President, Energy. The Agreement became effective on December 12, 2024 (the “Gallie Effective Date”)) and will
remain in effect indefinitely until terminated by either party.

The Gallie Agreement provides
for (A) a $250,000 annual base salary paid in equal installments on the Company’s regular pay dates no less frequently than semi-monthly,
(B) an annual discretionary bonus targeted at 100% of Mr. Gallie’s base salary, which may be paid in the form of 50% cash and 50%
RSUs, provided that to be eligible for any bonus, Mr. Gallie must be employed on the date any such bonus is paid, (C) five (5) weeks of
paid time off in accordance with the Company’s PTO policy and applicable state law, (D) eligibility to participate in customary
health, welfare, and fringe benefit plans provided to other similarly situated executive employees of the Company, and (E) within thirty
days following the Effective Date, the Company will recommend to the Company’s Board of Directors that it make a one-time equity
grant to Mr. Gallie in the form of 500,000 RSUs (the “Gallie Initial Award”). The Gallie Initial Award will vest as to one-fourth
(1/4
th
) of the RSUs on each of the first four (4) annual anniversaries of the Gallie Initial Award grant date. The Gallie Initial
Award and any RSUs granted to Mr. Gallie as a bonus shall be granted pursuant to the Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. 2024 Omnibus Incentive
Plan (the “Plan”).

If the Company terminates
Mr. Gallie without “cause” (as defined in the Plan) and Mr. Gallie executes and does not revoke a release of claims in favor
of the Company, the Company will pay Mr. Gallie one year of his base salary over the twelve months following his termination date.

The Gallie Agreement also requires Mr. Gallie
to execute the Company’s standard non-competition agreement.

Chang Advisory, Inc. Consulting Agreement 

Mr. Chang served as the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer through September 17, 2024. The Company terminated Mr. Chang for cause and did not provide any severance to Mr.
Chang. The terms of Mr. Chang’s agreement with the Company is described herein in accordance with SEC rules.

Mr. Chang served as Gryphon’s
Chief Executive Officer pursuant to a Consulting Agreement between Gryphon and Chang Advisory, Inc. (“Chang Advisory”), effective
January 14, 2021 (the “Chang Agreement”). Mr. Chang is the sole owner of Chang Advisory. Under the agreement, Chang Advisory’s
base fee was initially CAD $175,000 per year. The agreement provided that the base fee would increase to CAD $300,000 per year upon the
closing of either: (i) an equity financing totaling at least CAD $5 million or (ii) a debt and equity financing totaling at least CAD
$10 million. This condition was met in March 2021 and, accordingly, the base fee was raised to CAD $300,000 per year, which was later
raised to USD $300,000. Under the agreement, Chang Advisory’s base fee for any year could not be reduced without the written consent
of both Chang Advisory and Gryphon, and Chang Advisory was entitled to an annual cash incentive opportunity with a target equal to 100%
of Chang Advisory’s base fee for such year. The agreement further provided that Gryphon would pay to Chang Advisory harmonized sales
tax on any invoice or other compensation paid to Chang Advisory in the event that Gryphon’s head office becomes located in Canada
or in the event that any law or governmental authority requires that such tax be remitted by Chang Advisory in respect of any such compensation.

On the effective date of the
agreement, Chang Advisory became entitled to purchase, for USD $0.004 per share, 15.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Gryphon
as of such date. In the event that Chang Advisory’s engagement with Gryphon terminated by reason of Chang Advisory’s resignation
or by reason of a material breach by Chang Advisory of the agreement, or for cause (as defined in the Chang Agreement), prior to the one-year
anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, Gryphon or any other affiliate of Gryphon had the right (but not the obligation) to
repurchase (i) 75% of such shares if such termination occurred within six months of the effective date of the agreement; and (ii) 50%
of such shares if such termination occurred after six months and within one year of such effective date, in each case for a price of USD
$0.004 per share. Such repurchase right expired on the one-year anniversary of the effective date of the agreement.

In the event that Chang Advisory’s
engagement was terminated by Gryphon without cause, was terminated by Chang Advisory for good reason, or in the event that there was a
change in control (as defined in the agreement), all unvested equity awards held by Chang Advisory would have accelerated vesting and,
with respect to any stock options, such options would remain fully exercisable until their original expiry date. In the event of Chang
Advisory’s termination for cause or voluntary resignation, all equity awards granted to Chang Advisory that are outstanding on the
date of such termination or resignation would have continued to vest on the original schedule and any stock options would have remained
exercisable until the earlier of (i) the expiration date set forth in the applicable stock option agreement; or (ii) the expiration of
6 months measured from the date of such termination or resignation. 

The agreement also provided
that Chang Advisory will be entitled to receive reimbursement from Gryphon for all reasonable business expenses, and Mr. Chang and his
partner and dependents would be eligible to participate in the benefit plans that are available to the executive officers of Gryphon.
Under the agreement, Gryphon would have indemnified Chang Advisory and Mr. Chang to the fullest extent permitted by law against all costs,
charges, awards, legal fees and expenses which Chang Advisory and/or Mr. Chang were involved because of its/his/their association with
Gryphon, and Gryphon would have at all times maintain a Directors and Officers Insurance Policy under which Chang Advisory and Mr. Chang
would be insured.

74

Upon termination of engagement
due to the death or disability (as defined in the agreement) of Chang Advisory, Chang Advisory would have been entitled to receive: (i)
any unpaid annual bonus for the year immediately prior to the year of such termination (in an amount equal to the greater of the bonus
percentage accrued by Gryphon or Chang Advisory’s target annual bonus) and (ii) a pro-rated share of Chang Advisory’s target
annual bonus for the year of such termination (in an amount equal to the bonus percentage accrued by Gryphon through the last closed accounting
month prior to such termination but with such bonus percentage being deemed to be fully accrued if Gryphon was at least on target to attain
the appropriate financial targets for such year). In addition, in the case of termination due to disability, Gryphon would have continued
Chang Advisory’s and/or Mr. Chang’s participation in the benefit plans for so long as he remained disabled as defined under
those plans.

Under the agreement, if Gryphon
terminated Chang Advisory’s engagement (other than for cause or as a result of Chang Advisory’s death or disability), or in
the event Chang Advisory resigns for good reason, or in the event of a termination of Chang Advisory’s engagement whether by Chang
Advisory or by Gryphon for any reason other than cause within 6 months of a change in control, then Gryphon would have paid to Chang Advisory
(i) a termination fee equal to the annual fee; (ii) bonus for any prior year that has been earned but was unpaid (in an amount equal to
the greater of the bonus percentage accrued by Gryphon or Chang Advisory’s target annual bonus); and (iii) a pro-rated share of
Chang Advisory’s target annual bonus for the year of such termination (in an amount equal to the bonus percentage accrued by Gryphon
through the last closed accounting month prior such termination but with such bonus percentage being deemed to be fully accrued if Gryphon
was at least on target to attain the appropriate financial targets for such year). As mentioned above, the Company terminated Mr. Chang
for cause and as such, no severance payments were made to Mr. Chang. The Chang Agreement was terminated in connection with the Company’s
termination of Mr. Chang and is therefore no longer in effect. Mr. Chang continues to serve the Company as a non-employee member of the
Board.

Jessica Billingsley Employment Agreement 

Ms. Billingsley served as
the Chief Executive Officer of Akerna through Akerna’s merger with the Company pursuant to an employment agreement with Akerna (the
“Billingsley Agreement”). The Billingsley Agreement was terminated in connection with the merger, but the terms of the Billingsley
Agreement are described below in compliance with SEC rules. Ms. Billingsley now serves as a member of the Company’s Board.

Akerna paid Ms. Billingsley
an annual base salary in the amount of $300,000. The base salary was subject to (1) review at least annually by the Board for increase,
but not decrease, and (2) automatic increase by an amount equal to $50,000 from its then current level on the date upon which Akerna’s
aggregate, gross consolidated trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue equals the product of (x) two 
multiplied
 by (y) Akerna’s
TTM revenue as of the closing.

Ms. Billingsley was eligible
for an annual bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) with respect to each fiscal year ending during her employment. Her target annual
cash bonus was in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of her base salary (the “Target Bonus”) with the opportunity to
earn greater than the Target Bonus upon achievement of above target performance. The amount of the Annual Bonus was determined by the
Board on the basis of fulfillment of the objective performance criteria established in its reasonable discretion. The performance criteria
for any particular fiscal year was set no later than ninety days after the commencement of the relevant fiscal year.

Ms. Billingsley was entitled
to participate in annual equity awards and employee benefits. She was indemnified by Akerna for any and all expenses (including advancement
and payment of attorneys’ fees) and losses arising out of or relating to any of her actual or alleged acts, omissions, negligence,
or active or passive wrongdoing, including the advancement of expenses she incurred. The foregoing indemnification was in addition to
the indemnification provided to her by Akerna pursuant to her Indemnification Agreement.

In the event of Ms. Billingsley’s
termination for cause or without good reason, Akerna was obligated to pay any accrued but unpaid base salary and any annual bonus earned
and awarded for the fiscal year prior to that in which the termination occurs. In the event of Ms. Billingsley’s termination without
cause or with good reason, Akerna was obligated to pay any accrued but unpaid base salary, any annual bonus earned and awarded for the
fiscal year prior to that in which the termination occurs, a cash severance payment equal to her base salary, pro-rated annual bonus
for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs through the date of termination, and twelve months of health benefits.

75

The Billingsley Employment
Agreement also contained non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that applied through her employment and for a term of one
year thereafter, and which were in addition to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions prescribed under a certain Non-Competition Agreement
between Ms. Billingsley and Akerna. The Billingsley Employment Agreement also contained a non-disparagement provision that applies
through her employment and for a term of two years thereafter.

Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. 2024 Omnibus Incentive
Plan

Set forth below is a summary
of the material features of the Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”), which was adopted
in connection with the closing of the Business Combination.

The 2024 Plan provides for
the following grants: (a) incentive stock options (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”))
(“ISO” or “ISOs”); (b) nonstatutory stock options (i.e., options other than ISOs) (“NSO” or “NSOs”),
(c) stock appreciation rights (“SAR” or “SARs”), (d) restricted stock grants, (e) restricted stock unit grants
(“RSU” or “RSUs”), (f) performance grants, and (g) other grants based in whole or in part by reference to shares
that are granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2024 Plan.

Subject to any Capitalization
Adjustment (as defined and described below) and the automatic increase (as described later in this paragraph), and any other applicable
provisions in the 2024 Plan, the total number of shares reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the 2024 Plan is 5,810,033 shares
which was 15% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the closing of the Business Combination (the “Share Reserve”).
The Share Reserve will automatically increase on January 1
st
 of each year, for a period of not more than ten years, commencing
on January 1, 2025 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2033 by the lesser of (a) 3% of the total number of the shares of Common Stock
outstanding on December 31
st
 of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (b) such number of shares determined by the Board.

Following the effective date
of the 2024 Plan (the “Plan Effective Date”), any shares subject to an outstanding grant or any portion thereof granted under
the 2024 Plan will be returned to the Share Reserve and will be available for issuance in connection with subsequent grants under the
2024 Plan to the extent such shares: (a) are cancelled, forfeited, or settled in cash; (b) are used to pay the exercise price of such
outstanding grant or any Tax-Related Items (as defined below) arising in connection with vesting, exercise or settlement of such outstanding
grant; (c) are surrendered pursuant to an Exchange Program (as defined below); (d) expire by their terms at any time; or (e) are reacquired
by the Company pursuant to a forfeiture provision or repurchase right by the Company (collectively, “Returning Shares”). Shares
subject to Substitute Grants (as defined below) will not be deducted from the Share Reserve and may not be returned to the Share Reserve
as Returning Shares.

Subject to the provisions
relating to Capitalization Adjustments described below, the maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs
is 5,810,033 shares which was 15% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at the closing of the Merger (the “Incentive
Stock Option Limit”).

If, after the Plan Effective
Date, the number of outstanding shares is changed or the value of the shares is otherwise affected by a stock dividend, extraordinary
dividend or distribution (whether in cash, shares or other property, other than a regular cash dividend) recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, consolidation, reclassification, spin-off or similar change in the capital structure of
the Company or any similar equity restructuring transaction, as that term is used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor thereto), without consideration (a “Capitalization Adjustment”),
then (a) the maximum number and class of shares or type of security reserved for issuance and future grant from the Share Reserve, (b)
the exercise price, purchase price, and number and class of shares or type of security subject to outstanding grants, and (c) the number
and class of shares subject to the Incentive Stock Option Limit, will be proportionately adjusted, subject to any required action by the
board of directors or the stockholders of the Company and in compliance with applicable laws; provided that fractions of a share will
not be issued.

77

The shares issuable under
the 2024 Plan will be authorized but unissued or forfeited shares, treasury shares or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner.

Incentive stock options may
be granted only to employees of the Company, and its parent and any subsidiary entities (to the extent permitted under Section 422 of
the Code). All other grants may be granted to employees, consultants and directors, provided such consultants and directors render bona
fide services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction.

The maximum number of shares
subject to grants (and of cash subject to cash-settled grants) granted under the 2024 Plan or otherwise during any one calendar year to
any non-employee director for service on the board of directors, taken together with any cash fees paid by the Company to such non-employee
director during such calendar year for service on the board of directors, will not exceed $1,000,000 in total value (calculating the value
of any such grants based on the grant date fair value of such grants for financial reporting purposes).

Each option or SAR will be
in such form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Administrator (defined below) deems appropriate. Each SAR will be denominated
in share equivalents. The provisions of separate options or SARs need not be identical.

Options and SARs may be exercisable
within the times or upon the events determined by the Administrator and as set forth in the grant agreement governing such grant. No option
or SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date the option or SAR is granted, or such shorter period specified
in the grant agreement. In addition, in the case of an ISO granted to a person who, at the time the ISO is granted, directly or by attribution
owns more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any parent or subsidiary
(“Ten Percent Holder”), such option may not be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date the ISO is
granted.

The exercise price of an option
or SAR will be such price as is determined by the Administrator and set forth in the grant agreement; provided that (a) in the case of
an ISO (i) granted to a Ten Percent Holder, the exercise price will be no less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair market
value (as defined in the 2024 Plan) on the date of grant and (ii) granted to any other employee, the exercise price will be no less than
one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value on the date of grant, and (b) in the case of an NSO or SAR, the exercise price will
be such price as is determined by the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an option or SAR that is a Substitute Grant (as defined
below) may be granted with an exercise price lower than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value.

Upon exercise of a SAR, a
grantee will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying (a) the difference between the fair
market value of a share on the date of exercise over the exercise price, by (b) the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is
exercised. At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment from the Company for the SAR exercise may be in cash, in shares of equivalent
value, or in some combination thereof.

Unless explicitly provided
otherwise in a grantee’s grant agreement, if a grantee’s continuous service status (as defined in the 2024 Plan) is terminated,
the grantee (or his or her legal representative, in the case of death) may exercise his or her option or SAR (to the extent such grant
was exercisable on the termination date) within the following period of time following the termination of the grantee’s continuous
service status: (a) three (3) months following a termination of a grantee’s continuous service status by the Company or any parent
or subsidiary without cause (as defined in the 2024 Plan) or by the grantee for any reason (other than due to death or disability (as
disability is defined in the Plan)); (b) six (6) months following a termination due to the grantee’s disability; (c) twelve (12)
months following a termination due to the grantee’s death; and (d) twelve (12) months following the grantee’s death, if such
death occurs following the date of such termination but during the period such grant is otherwise exercisable (as provided in clauses
(a) or (b) above). 

78

Except as otherwise provided
in the grant agreement, if a grantee’s continuous service status is terminated by the Company or any parent or subsidiary for cause,
the grantee’s options or SARs will terminate and be forfeited immediately upon such grantee’s termination of continuous service
status, and the grantee will be prohibited from exercising any portion (including any vested portion) of such grants on and after the
date of such termination of continuous service status.

To the extent that the aggregate
fair market value of shares with respect to which options designated as ISOs are exercisable for the first time by any grantee during
any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000),
such excess options will be treated as NSOs. For this purpose, ISOs will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted,
and the fair market value of the shares subject to an ISO will be determined as of the date of the grant of such option.

Without stockholder approval,
the Administrator may modify, extend or renew outstanding options or SARs, and authorize the grant of new options or SARs in substitution
therefor, including in connection with an Exchange Program. Any such action may not, without the written consent of a grantee, materially
impair any of such grantee’s rights under any grant previously granted, except that the Administrator may reduce the exercise price
of an outstanding option or SAR without the consent of a grantee by a written notice (notwithstanding any adverse tax consequences to
the grantee arising from the repricing); provided, however, that the exercise price may not be reduced below the fair market value on
the date the action is taken to reduce the exercise price.

A restricted stock grant is
an offer by the Company to sell or issue (with no payment required, unless explicitly provided otherwise in a grantee’s grant agreement)
shares to a grantee that are subject to certain specified restrictions. Each restricted stock grant will be in such form and will contain
such terms and conditions as the Administrator will deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of restricted stock grants may change from
time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate grant agreements need not be identical.

The purchase price for shares
issued pursuant to a restricted stock grant, if any, will be determined by the Administrator on the date the restricted stock grant is
granted and, if permitted by applicable law, no cash consideration will be required in connection with the payment for the purchase price
where the Administrator provides that payment will be in the form of services previously rendered.

Grantees holding restricted
stock grants will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares, unless the Administrator
provides otherwise at the time the grant is granted. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in shares, the shares will be subject
to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the restricted stock grants with respect to which they were paid.

An RSU grant is a grant covering
a number of shares that may be settled in cash, or by issuance of those shares at a date in the future. Each RSU grant will be in such
form and will contain such terms and conditions as the Administrator will deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of RSU grants may
change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate grant agreements need not be identical. Unless otherwise determined
by the Administrator, no purchase price will apply to an RSU settled in shares. Payment of vested RSUs will be made as soon as practicable
after the date(s) determined by the Administrator and set forth in the grant agreement. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
settle vested RSUs in cash, shares, or a combination of both.

The Administrator may permit
grantees holding RSUs to receive dividend equivalent rights (as defined in the 2024 Plan) on outstanding RSUs if and when dividends are
paid to stockholders on shares. In the discretion of the Administrator, such dividend equivalent rights may be paid in cash or shares,
and may either be paid at the same time as dividend payments are made to stockholders or delayed until shares are issued pursuant to the
underlying RSUs, and may be subject to the same vesting or performance requirements as the RSUs. If the Administrator permits dividend
equivalent rights to be made on RSUs, the terms and conditions for such dividend equivalent rights will be set forth in the applicable
grant agreement.

79

A performance grant is a grant
that may be granted, may vest or may become eligible to vest contingent upon the attainment during a performance period of performance
goals determined by the Administrator. Performance grants may be granted as options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs or other grants, including
cash-based grants. 

Performance grants will be
based on the attainment of performance goals that are established by the Administrator for the relevant performance period. Prior to the
grant of any performance grant, the Administrator will determine and each grant agreement will set forth the terms of each performance
grant. A performance grant may but need not require the grantee’s completion of a specified period of service. The Administrator
will determine the extent to which a performance grant has been earned in its sole discretion. The Administrator may reduce or waive any
criteria with respect to a performance goal, or adjust a performance goal (or method of calculating the attainment of a performance goal)
to take into account unanticipated events, including changes in law and accounting or tax rules, as the Administrator deems necessary
or appropriate, or to reflect the impact of extraordinary or unusual items, events or circumstances to avoid windfalls or hardships. The
Administrator may also adjust or eliminate the compensation or economic benefit due upon attainment of performance goals in its sole discretion,
subject to any limitations contained in the grant agreement and compliance with applicable law.

Other forms of grants valued
in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, shares, including the appreciation in value thereof (e.g., options or stock
rights with an exercise price or strike price less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares at the time of grant) may be granted
either alone or in addition to other grants provided for in the 2024 Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2024 Plan and applicable law,
the Administrator may determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such other grants will be granted, the number of shares
(or the cash equivalent thereof) to be granted pursuant to such other grants and all other terms and conditions of such other grants.

Payment from a grantee for
shares acquired pursuant to the 2024 Plan may be made in cash or cash equivalents or, where approved for the grantee by the Administrator
and where permitted by applicable law (and to the extent not otherwise set forth in the applicable grant agreement): (a) by cancellation
of indebtedness of the Company owed to the grantee; (b) by surrender of shares held by the grantee that are clear of all liens, claims,
encumbrances or security interests and that have a fair market value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate payment required;
(c) by waiver of compensation due or accrued to the grantee for services rendered or to be rendered to the Company or an affiliate; (d)
by consideration received by the Company pursuant to a broker-assisted or other form of cashless exercise program implemented by the Administrator
in connection with the 2024 Plan; (e) by the Company withholding otherwise deliverable shares having a fair market value on the date of
withholding equal to the aggregate payment required; (f) by any combination of the foregoing; or (g) by any other method of payment as
is permitted by applicable law.

Regardless of any action taken
by the Company or any affiliate, the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment
on account, employment tax, stamp tax or other Tax-Related Items related to the grantee’s participation in the 2024 Plan and legally
applicable to the grantee, including any employer liability for which the grantee is liable (the “Tax-Related Items”) is the
grantee’s responsibility.

Unless otherwise provided
in the grantee’s grant agreement, the Administrator, or its delegate(s) (as permitted by applicable law), in its sole discretion
and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time and subject to limitations of applicable law, may require or permit
a grantee to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items, in whole or in part by (without limitation): (a) requiring
the grantee to make a cash payment; (b) withholding from the grantee’s wages or other cash compensation paid to the grantee by the
Company or any affiliate; (c) withholding from the shares otherwise issuable pursuant to a grant; (d) permitting the grantee to deliver
to the Company already-owned shares or (e) withholding from the proceeds of the sale of otherwise deliverable shares acquired pursuant
to a grant either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company. The Company or an affiliate may withhold
or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates,
including up to the maximum applicable rate in the grantee’s jurisdiction.

Except as expressly provided
in the 2024 Plan or an applicable grant agreement, or otherwise determined by the Administrator, grants granted under the 2024 Plan will
not be transferable or assignable by the grantee, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Any options, SARs or
other grants that are exercisable may only be exercised: (a) during the grantee’s lifetime only by (i) the grantee, or (ii) the
grantee’s guardian or legal representative; (b) after the grantee’s death, by the legal representative of the grantee’s
heirs or legatees. The Administrator may permit transfer of grants in a manner that is not prohibited by applicable law.

80

No grantee will have any of
the rights of a stockholder with respect to any shares until the shares are issued to the grantee, except for any dividend equivalent
rights permitted by an applicable grant agreement. After shares are issued to the grantee, the grantee will be a stockholder and have
all the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares, including the right to vote and receive all dividends or other distributions
made or paid with respect to such shares, subject to any repurchase or forfeiture provisions in any restricted stock grant, the terms
of the Company’s insider trading policy, and applicable law. 

Without prior stockholder
approval, the Administrator may conduct an Exchange Program, subject to consent of an affected grantee (unless not required in connection
with a repricing pursuant to the 2024 Plan, or under the terms of a grant agreement) and compliance with applicable law. For purposes
of the 2024 Plan, “Exchange Program” means a program pursuant to which (a) outstanding grants are surrendered, cancelled or
exchanged for cash, the same type of grant or a different grant (or combination thereof) or (b) the exercise price of an outstanding grant
is increased or reduced.

All grants granted under the
2024 Plan will be subject to clawback or recoupment under any clawback or recoupment policy adopted by the board of directors or the Administrator
or required by applicable law during the term of grantee’s employment or other service with the Company that is applicable to officers,
employees, directors or other service providers of the Company. In addition, the Administrator may impose such other clawback, recovery
or recoupment provisions in a grant agreement as the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate.

Except as otherwise provided
in the applicable grant agreement or as determined by the Administrator, if a grantee’s continuous service status terminates for
any reason, vesting of a grant will cease and such portion of a grant that has not vested will be forfeited, and the grantee will have
no further right, title or interest in any then-unvested portion of the grant. In addition, the Company may receive through a forfeiture
condition or a repurchase right any or all of the shares held by the grantee under a restricted stock grant that have not vested as of
the date of such termination, subject to the terms of the applicable grant agreement.

In the event that the Company
is subject to a change in control (as defined in the 2024 Plan), outstanding grants acquired under the 2024 Plan will be subject to the
agreement evidencing the change in control, which need not treat all outstanding grants in an identical manner. Such agreement, without
the grantee’s consent, may provide for one or more of the following with respect to all outstanding grants as of the effective date
of such change in control: (a) the continuation of an outstanding grant by the Company (if the Company is the successor entity); (b) the
assumption of an outstanding grant by the successor or acquiring entity (if any) of such change in control (or by its parents, if any);
(c) the substitution by the successor or acquiring entity in such change in control (or by its parents, if any) of equivalent awards with
substantially the same terms for such outstanding grants; (d) the full or partial acceleration of exercisability or vesting and accelerated
expiration of an outstanding grant and lapse of the Company’s right to repurchase or re-acquire shares acquired under a grant or
lapse of forfeiture rights with respect to shares acquired under a grant; (e) the settlement of such outstanding grant (whether or not
then vested or exercisable) in cash, cash equivalents, or securities of the successor entity (or its parent, if any) with a fair market
value equal to the required amount provided in the definitive agreement evidencing the change in control, followed by the cancellation
of such grants; or (f) the cancellation of outstanding grants in exchange for no consideration.

81

The Company, from time to
time, may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other
company or otherwise, by either (a) granting a grant under the 2024 Plan in substitution of such other company’s award; or (b)
assuming such award as if it had been granted under the 2024 Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to a grant granted
under the 2024 Plan (a “Substitute Grant”). Such substitution or assumption will be permissible if the holder of the Substitute
Grant would have been eligible to be granted a grant under the 2024 Plan if the other company had applied the rules of the 2024 Plan
to such grant. The exercise price and the number and nature of shares issuable upon exercise or settlement of any such Substitute Grant
will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to Section 424(a) of the Code and/or Section 409A of the Code, as applicable.

The 2024 Plan will be administered
by the Compensation Committee or the Board acting as the Compensation Committee (the “Administrator”). Without limitation,
the Administrator will have the authority to, subject to the preceding sentence: construe and interpret the 2024 Plan, any grant agreement
and any other agreement or document executed pursuant to the 2024 Plan; prescribe, amend, expand, modify and rescind or terminate rules
and regulations relating to the 2024 Plan or any grant (including the terms or conditions of any grant); approve persons to receive grants;
determine the form, terms and conditions of grants; determine the number of shares or other consideration subject to grants; determine
the fair market value in good faith and interpret the applicable provisions of the 2024 Plan and the definition of fair market value in
connection with circumstances that impact the fair market value, if necessary; determine whether grants will be granted singly, in combination
with, in tandem with, in replacement of, or as alternatives to, other grants under the 2024 Plan or awards under any other incentive or
compensation plan of the Company or any affiliate; grant waivers of any conditions of the 2024 Plan or any grant; determine the vesting,
exercisability and payment of grants; correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2024 Plan, any grant
or any grant agreement; determine whether a grant has been earned or has vested; determine the terms and conditions of any, and to institute
any exchange program; adopt or revise rules and/or procedures (including the adoption or revision of any subplan under the 2024 Plan)
relating to the operation and administration of the 2024 Plan to facilitate compliance with requirements of local law and procedures outside
the United States (provided that board of directors approval will not be necessary for immaterial modifications to the 2024 Plan or any
grant agreement made to ensure or facilitate compliance with the laws or regulations of the relevant foreign jurisdiction); delegate any
of the foregoing to one or more persons pursuant to a specific delegation as permitted by the terms of the 2024 Plan and applicable law,
including Section 157(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law; and make all other determinations necessary or advisable in connection
with the administration of the 2024 Plan. We expect that our Compensation Committee will administer the 2024 Plan. 

To the maximum extent permitted
by applicable laws, each member of the Administrator (including officers of the Company or an affiliate of the Company, if applicable),
or of the board of directors, as applicable, will be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from (i) any loss, cost,
liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action,
suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to
act under the 2024 Plan or pursuant to the terms and conditions of any grant except for actions taken in bad faith or failures to act
in good faith, and (ii) any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company’s approval, or paid by him
or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided that such member will
give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend any such claim, action, suit or proceeding before he or she
undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification will not be exclusive of any other
rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract,
as a matter of law or otherwise, or under any other power that the Company may have to indemnify or hold harmless each such person.

82

The 2024 Plan and all grants
granted thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to that
body of laws pertaining to conflict of laws.

The Administrator may amend
the 2024 Plan or any grant in any respect the Administrator deems necessary or advisable, subject to the limitations of applicable law
and the 2024 Plan. If required by applicable law, the Company will seek stockholder approval of any amendment of the 2024 Plan that (a)
materially increases the number of shares available for issuance under the 2024 Plan (excluding any capitalization adjustment); (b) materially
expands the class of individuals eligible to receive grants under the 2024 Plan; (c) materially increases the benefits accruing to grantees
under the 2024 Plan; (d) materially reduces the price at which shares may be issued or purchased under the 2024 Plan; (e) materially extends
the term of the 2024 Plan; (f) materially expands the types of grants available for issuance under the 2024 Plan; or (g) as otherwise
required by applicable law.

The 2024 Plan will terminate
automatically on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Plan Effective Date. No grant will be granted pursuant to the 2024 Plan after such
date, but grants previously granted may extend beyond that date. The Administrator may suspend or terminate the 2024 Plan at any earlier
date at any time. No grants may be granted under the 2024 Plan while the 2024 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.

No amendment, suspension or
termination of the 2024 Plan or any grant may materially impair a grantee’s rights under any outstanding grant, except with the
written consent of the affected grantee or as otherwise expressly permitted in the 2024 Plan. Subject to the limitations of applicable
law, if any, the Administrator may amend the terms of any one or more grants without the affected grantee’s consent (a) to maintain
the qualified status of the grant as an ISO under Section 422 of the Code; (b) to change the terms of an ISO, if such change results in
impairment of the grant solely because it impairs the qualified status of the grant as an ISO; (c) to clarify the manner of exemption
from, or to bring the grant into compliance with, Section 409A of the Code; or (d) to facilitate compliance with other applicable laws.

Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

The following summary is intended
only as a general guide to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of participation in the 2024 Plan. The summary is based on existing
U.S. laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that those laws and regulations will not change. The summary is not complete
and does not discuss the tax consequences upon a grantee’s death, or the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country
in which the grantee may reside. Tax consequences for any particular grantee may vary based on individual circumstances.

Incentive Stock Options.

A grantee recognizes no taxable income for regular income tax purposes because of the grant or exercise of an option that qualifies
as incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code. If a grantee exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes
of the shares acquired through the exercise of the option after both the two-year anniversary of the date the option was granted and the
one-year anniversary of the exercise, the grantee will recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the sale price
of the shares and the exercise price, and we will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes. 

However, if the grantee disposes
of such shares either on or before the two-year anniversary of the date of grant or on or before the one-year anniversary of the date
of exercise (a “disqualifying disposition”), any gain up to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date
of exercise over the exercise price generally will be taxed as ordinary income, unless the shares are disposed of in a transaction in
which the grantee would not recognize a loss (such as a gift). Any gain in excess of that amount will be a capital gain. If a loss is
recognized, there will be no ordinary income, and such loss will be a capital loss. Any ordinary income recognized by the grantee upon
the disqualifying disposition of the shares generally should be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes, except to the
extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.

83

For purposes of the alternative
minimum tax, the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date is treated
as an adjustment item in computing the grantee’s alternative minimum taxable income in the year of exercise. In addition, special
alternative minimum tax rules may apply to certain subsequent disqualifying dispositions of the shares or provide certain basis adjustments
or tax credits for purposes.

Nonstatutory Stock Options.

A grantee generally recognizes no taxable income as the result of the grant of such an option. However, upon exercising the option,
the grantee normally recognizes ordinary income equal to the amount that the fair market value of the shares on such date exceeds the
exercise price. If the grantee is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes.
Upon the sale of the shares acquired by exercising a nonstatutory stock option, any gain or loss (based on the difference between the
sale price and the fair market value on the exercise date) will be taxed as capital gain or loss. Any ordinary income recognized by the
grantee upon exercising a nonstatutory stock option generally should be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes, except
to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code. No tax deduction is available to the Company with respect
to the grant of a nonstatutory stock option or the sale of the shares acquired through the exercise of the nonstatutory stock option.

Stock Appreciation Rights.

In general, no taxable income is reportable when a stock appreciation right is granted to a grantee. Upon exercise, the grantee generally
will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of any shares received. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any
later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss.

Restricted Stock Awards.

A grantee acquiring shares of restricted stock generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares
on the vesting date, reduced by any amount paid by the grantee for such shares. If the grantee is an employee, such ordinary income generally
is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. The grantee may elect, under Section 83(b) of the Code to accelerate the ordinary
income tax event to the date of acquisition by filing an election with the Internal Revenue Service no later than thirty (30) days after
the date the shares are acquired. Upon the sale of shares acquired under a restricted stock award, any gain or loss, based on the difference
between the sale price and the fair market value on the date the ordinary income tax event occurs, will be taxed as capital gain or loss.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards.

There are no immediate tax consequences of receiving an award of restricted stock units. A grantee who is awarded restricted stock
units generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of shares issued to such grantee at the end of the applicable
vesting period or, if later, the settlement date elected by the administrator or a grantee. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon
any later disposition of any shares received would be capital gain or loss.

Performance Shares and
Performance Unit Awards. 
A grantee generally will recognize no income upon the grant of a performance share or a performance unit
award. Upon the settlement of such awards, grantees normally will recognize ordinary income in the year of receipt in an amount equal
to the cash received and the fair market value of any cash or unrestricted shares received. If the grantee is an employee, such ordinary
income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of any shares received, any gain or loss, based
on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the date the ordinary income tax event occurs, will be taxed as
capital gain or loss.

Section 409A. 
Section
409A of the Code provides certain requirements for non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements with respect to an individual’s
deferral and distribution elections and permissible distribution events. Awards granted under the 2024 Plan with a deferral feature will
be subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. If an award is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section
409A of the Code, the recipient of that award may recognize ordinary income on the amounts deferred under the award, to the extent vested,
which may be before the compensation is actually or constructively received. Also, if an award subject to Section 409A of the Code violates
the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, Section 409A of the Code imposes an additional 20% federal income tax on compensation recognized
as ordinary income, and interest on such deferred compensation.

Tax Effect for the Company.

We generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the 2024 Plan equal to the ordinary income realized
by a grantee when the grantee recognizes such income (for example, the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option) except to the extent such
deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code. Special rules limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our chief executive
officer, chief financial officer and other “covered employees” as determined under Section 162(m) of the Code and applicable
guidance. Under Section 162(m) of the Code, the annual compensation paid to any of these specified executives will be deductible only
to the extent that it does not exceed $1,000,000.

THE FOREGOING IS ONLY A SUMMARY
OF THE EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION UPON GRANTEES AND THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO AWARDS UNDER THE 2024 PLAN. IT DOES NOT PURPORT
TO BE COMPLETE AND DOES NOT DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER TAX REQUIREMENTS, THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF A GRANTEE’S DEATH,
OR THE PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, STATE, OR FOREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH THE GRANTEE MAY RESIDE.

Benefits and Perquisites

The Company offers a standard
benefits program for its named executive officers, which includes medical, dental, vision, life and AD&D insurance, short- and long-term
disability coverage, flexible spending accounts, vacation time, paid holidays, and participation in a 401(k) plan, when   established.

Pay versus Performance

Pursuant to Section 953(a) of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the
following information regarding “compensation actually paid”, as defined in Item 402(v). In accordance with SEC rules,
the “compensation actually paid” amounts shown in the table below for each applicable year reflect certain adjustments to
the values reported in the Summary of Compensation Table as described in the footnotes to the following table. 

Compensation actually paid
differs materially from the amount of cash actually paid to the Company’s officers. In 2024, this difference can be summarized
as follows:

●
Jimmy Vaiopoulos (Chairman)

●
Brittany Kaiser

●
Jessica Billingsley

●
Robby Chang

●
Heather Cox

●
Daniel Tolhurst

●
Dan Grigorin

From the Closing to October
1, 2024, our Board members were compensated pursuant to our former director compensation program, which provided for (i) an annual cash
retainer of $35,000, (ii) an additional committee chairperson retainer of $12,500, and (iii) an additional committee member retainer of
$10,000. A director could not receive both a committee chairperson and a member retainer for service on the same committee. The retainers
were earned on a quarterly basis and paid in arrears not later than 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter. Prior to the Closing,
Gryphon did not have a formal compensation policy for non-employee directors and instead entered into Director Agreements with its directors.

On October 1, 2024, based

or otherwise had a material business relationship with Gryphon. Ms. Kaiser is also subject to a customary non-competition covenant in

6,941,856 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share (the “Common Warrants”), at a combined purchase
price per share and accompanying Common Warrant equal to $0.40 for third-party investors and $0.516 for directors and officers of the
Company. The offering closed on January 14, 2025. Jessica Billingsley purchased 48,412 shares of Common Stock and 48,412 accompanying

Indemnification

Our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting the liability of directors, and our amended and restated bylaws provides that
we will indemnify the directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and bylaws also provide the Board with discretion to indemnify the other officers, employees, and agents when determined
appropriate by the Board.

Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedure

Our Code of Ethics requires
us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except
under guidelines approved by the Board (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1)
the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) the Company or any of its subsidiaries
is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner
of shares of Common Stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct
or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity).
A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper
personal benefits as a result of his or her position.

Our audit committee, pursuant
to its written charter, is responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions.
The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether
the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under
the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction.

interim periods through April 26, 2024. As previously disclosed, the Company dismissed Marcum on April 26, 2024. The dismissal of Marcum
was approved by the audit committee and was not the result of any disagreement with Marcum. Marcum’s audit reports on the financial
statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 of the Company did not provide an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion to the Company’s
financial statements, nor did it modify its opinion as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that such report

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements
of operations stockholders’ equity/(deficit) and cash flows for each of the years the two-year period ended December 31, 2024, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements,
the Company has incurred a loss from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's evaluation of the events and conditions and management's plans regarding these matters
are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for digital assets (crypto currencies) to fair value,
with changes in fair value recognized in net income, effective as of January 1, 2024 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) No. 2023-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto
Assets (“ASU 2023-08”).

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

F-
2

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter
communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in
any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relate.

Evaluation of Accounting
for and Disclosure of Cryptocurrency Mining Revenue Recognized

As discussed in Note
1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
For cryptocurrency mining revenue, the Company provides computing power services to the mining pools and in exchange for providing such
computing power, the Company is entitled to considerations in the form of cryptocurrencies from the mining pools. The Company’s
management has exercised significant judgments in their determination of how existing accounting guidance should be applied to the accounting
for and disclosure of cryptocurrency mining revenue recognized.

We identified the accounting
for and disclosure of cryptocurrency mining revenue recognized as a critical audit matter due to the nature and extent of audit effort
required to address the matter, which includes significant involvement of more experienced engagement team members. Subjective auditor
judgment was required in determining the nature and extent of audit procedures to test the occurrence of the revenues recognized by the
Company.

The primary procedures we performed to address
this critical audit matter included the following:

●
Evaluated the design of the Company’s information
technology (“IT”) environment that is relevant to the cryptocurrency mining revenue with the assistance of our IT professional;

●
Performed site visit of the facility where the
Company’s mining machines were located, which included an observation of the physical and environmental controls and mining machines
observation procedures;

●
Evaluated management’s rationale for the
application of ASC 606 to account for its cryptocurrency mining revenue, which included evaluating the contracts between the Company and
the mining pool operator;

●
Evaluated and tested management’s rationale
and supporting documentation associated with the valuation of cryptocurrency awards earned;

●
Compared the Company’s wallet records of
cryptocurrency mining revenue received to publicly available blockchain records and evaluated the relevance and reliability of audit evidence
obtained from public blockchains;

●
Performed certain substantive analytical procedures
to determine completeness and existence of cryptocurrency assets earned by the Company as consideration for services rendered; and

●
Evaluated management’s disclosures of its
cryptocurrency mining revenue in the financial statement footnotes.

Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc.

Notes to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements

For the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Organization and Nature of Operations

Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (“Gryphon”), which
originally began operations as Ivy Crypto, Inc., was incorporated under the provisions and by the virtue of the provisions
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware on October 22, 2020, with its office located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gryphon
operates a digital asset (commonly referred to as cryptocurrency) mining operation using specialized computers equipped with application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) chips (known as “miners”) to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in
a process known as “solving a block”) in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards (primarily Bitcoin). Gryphon became
a publicly held entity in February 2024 upon the completion of a reverse merger transaction (the “Merger”) with Akerna Corp.,
herein referred to as we, us, our, the Company or Akerna. These consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including
disclosures for certain activities up to and including the February 9, 2024 (the “Effective Date”) the date of the Merger,
are exclusively attributable to the operations of Ivy Crypto, Inc. The common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”) is
traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “GRYP” after February 9, 2024.

The legacy Akerna (“Legacy Akerna’)
was formed upon completion of the mergers between MTech Acquisition Corp. (“MTech”) and MJ Freeway, LLC (“MJF”)
on June 17, 2019 as contemplated by the Merger Agreement dated October 10, 2018, as amended (the “Formation Mergers”). Akerna
provided software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions within the cannabis industry that enabled regulatory compliance and
inventory management through several wholly-owned subsidiaries including MJF, Trellis Solutions, Inc. (“Trellis”), Ample
Organics, Inc. (“Ample”), Last Call Analytics (“LCA”), solo sciences, inc. (“Solo”),
Viridian Sciences, Inc. (“Viridian”), and The NAV People, Inc. d.b.a. 365 Cannabis (“365 Cannabis”).
Our common stock, $
0.0001
 par value (“Common Stock”) was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market
(the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “KERN” through February 9, 2024.

Prior to the merger date of February 9, 2024,
Legacy Akerna committed to a number of significant actions that collectively represented a strategic shift in its business strategy and
a complete exit from the SaaS business serving the cannabis industry. The shift was effectuated in a two-part exit strategy
whereby Legacy Akerna management (i) disposed of its component SaaS business units in advance of (ii) the Merger with Gryphon, an
entity unaffiliated with the SaaS and cannabis industries.

Reverse Merger with Legacy Ivy Crypto, Inc.

On January 27, 2023, Akerna entered into an agreement and
plan of merger, as amended on April 28, 2023 and June 14, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”) with Ivy Crypto, Inc. (formerly known
as Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (“Ivy”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Gryphon Opco I LLC. On February 9, 2024, concurrent
with the closing of the Sale Transaction, Legacy Akerna merged with and into Ivy, with Ivy surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Akerna. Following the closing of the Merger, the former Ivy and Akerna stockholders immediately before
the Merger owned approximately 
92.5
 percent and 
7.5
 percent, respectively, of the outstanding capital stock
on a fully diluted basis which effectively resulted in a change in control of the Company. Upon completion of the Merger, Akerna changed
its name to Gryphon.

F-
8

On February 9, 2024, the Company completed the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Merger”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Akerna Merger Co.
(“Merger Sub”) merged with and into Ivy, with Ivy surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akerna. On the Effective Date
of the Merger, each share of Ivy’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “Ivy Common Stock”), and Ivy’s
preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “Ivy Preferred Stock,” collectively referred to herein with the Ivy
Common Stock as the “Ivy Shares”), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date was converted into the right to receive
approximately 
1.7273744
 shares of Gryphon common stock. Each warrant to purchase common stock of Ivy that was issued and outstanding
at the Effective Date remained issued and outstanding and were assumed by the Company and is exercisable for shares of common stock pursuant
to its existing terms and conditions as adjusted to reflect the ratio of exchange of Ivy Shares for shares of common stock. In connection
with the Merger, on February 8, 2024, Akerna filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the
“Reverse Stock Split Amendment”). Because the Reverse Stock Split Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares
of common stock, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance relative
to the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split did not modify any voting rights or other terms of the common
stock. Eighty thousand and eight hundred and sixty-four (
80,864
) fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.
Immediately after giving effect to the Merger and the Reverse Stock Split, the Company had 
38,038,533
 shares of common stock
outstanding. On February 9, 2024, the common stock began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “GRYP.” All
share and per-share data presented in these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted for the exchange ratio.

As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Akerna’s
operations were sold concurrently with the closure of the merger, so the Company’s operations after the Merger are those of Ivy. 

Ivy is treated as the accounting acquirer in
the Merger as its stockholders, board of directors, and management control the Company after the Merger, even though Akerna was the legal
acquirer. The Merger was treated as a reverse recapitalization of Ivy effected by a share exchange for a financial account and reporting
purposes since all of Akerna’s operations were disposed of as part of the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, Ivy recorded no
goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of the merger. The Merger was treated as if Ivy issued 
2,921,362
 shares of
common stock for the $(
2,256,000
) net book value of Akerna. As a result, the assets, liabilities, and historical operations reflected
in these financial statements are those of Ivy, as if Ivy had always been the reporting company.

The Akerna net book value of approximately $(
2,256,000
)
consisted of $
500,000
 of cash, prepaid expense of approximately $
98,000
 and liabilities of approximately $
2,854,000
.

On April 20, 2022, Ivy formed a limited liability
company named Gryphon Opco I LLC (“GOI”). GOI aims to engage in any activity for which limited liability companies may be
organized in the State of Delaware.

On December 20, 2024, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary
Canada corporation named 2670786 Alberta LTD (“Alberta LTD”). Alberta LTD was formed to be the holding company for the prospective
acquisition of Captus Energy, as further described in Note 13 – Subsequent Events.

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications have been made to the
2023 consolidated financial statements in order to conform to the current period presentations.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”),
which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in
the ordinary course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily
purport to represent realizable or settlement values. 

Since the Company began revenue generation in
September 2021, management has financed the Company’s operations through equity and debt financing and the sale of the digital
assets earned through mining operations. On December 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $
735,000
 and digital
assets totaling $
1,016,000
.

F-
9

The Company may incur additional losses from
operations and negative cash outflows from operations in the foreseeable future. In the event the Company continues to incur losses,
it may need to raise debt or equity financing to finance its operations until operations are cashflow positive. However, there can be
no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms, when and if needed, or at all. The
precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time and will depend on several factors, including
the market price for the underlying commodity mined by the Company and its ability to procure the required mining equipment and operate
profitably. The Company’s financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company’s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. 

Segment Reporting

The Company adopted FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting
(ASC Topic 280) for the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2024. The most significant provision was for the Company to disclose
significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The Company’s
CODM group is composed of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company operates as one operating segment
and uses net income or loss as measures of profit or loss on a consolidated basis in making decisions regarding resource allocation and
performance assessment. Additionally, the Company’s CODM regularly reviews the Company’s expenses on a consolidated basis.
The financial metrics used by the CODM help make key operating decisions, such as determination of significant acquisitions and allocation
of budget between cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses.

Since the Company operates as one reportable segment, all financial
information required by “Segment Reporting” can be found in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The CODM
does not review segment assets at a level other than that presented in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. There are no
intra-entity sales or transfers and no significant expense categories regularly provided to the CODM beyond those disclosed in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825-10”) which defines fair value
as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.

ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy
that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level
1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions
(less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation
methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all short-term highly liquid
investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
are recorded at cost, which approximates their fair value. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in accounts that at times may be in excess of the federally insured limit
of $
250,000
 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions. As of December
31, 2024, and 2023, the Company had $
435,000
 and $
665,000
 in excess of the federal insurance limit, respectively. Also, the
Company held cash for third parties in the amount of $
8,000
 as of December 31, 2023. The Company has never suffered a loss
due to such excess balances.

Accounts Receivable

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no accounts
receivable.

As of December 31, 2023, accounts receivable
includes amounts due from Sphere 3D under the Company’s master services agreement with Sphere 3D. The Company collected these amounts
in the first quarter of 2024.

Prepaid Expenses

Prepaid expenses consist of payments for an insurance
policy and are expected to be realized and consumed within twelve months after the reporting period.

Digital Assets Held for Other Parties

In accordance with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, the Company records an obligation liability, and a corresponding digital asset held
for other parties’ assets based on the fair value of the cryptocurrency held for other parties at each reporting date. In accordance
with ASC 820, the Company has fair valued these digital assets and the associated liability by using the quoted price of Bitcoin
at closing by its Principal Market, Coinbase, on the reporting date. This balance also includes the cash balance held for other parties.

Digital Assets

Digital assets or cryptocurrencies (including
Bitcoin, Ethereum, DAI, and USDT) are included in current assets in the accompanying balance sheets. Cryptocurrencies purchased are recorded
at cost and cryptocurrencies obtained by the Company through its sale of common stock are accounted for based on the value of the specific
digital asset on the date received.

Digital assets are included in current assets
in the consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability to sell bitcoin in a highly liquid marketplace and the sale of
bitcoin to fund operating expenses to support operations. Following the adoption of ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024, the Company measures
digital assets at fair value with changes recognized in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

Mining Equipment

Mining equipment is stated at cost, including
purchase price and all shipping and customs fees, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally three years for cryptocurrency mining equipment.

The Company reviews the carrying amounts of mining
equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where it is not possible to estimate
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
asset belongs.

F-
11

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair
value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows to be derived from continuing
use of the asset or cash-generating unit are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Fair value less costs of disposal is the amount obtainable
from the sale of an asset or cash-generating unit in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the
cost of disposal. When a binding sale agreement is not available, fair value less costs of disposal is estimated using a discounted cash
flow approach with inputs and assumptions consistent with those of a market participant. If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating
unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in net income.

At the point in time a miner becomes inoperable
and not repairable, the Company records an expense amounting to the carrying value, which is the cost basis less accumulated depreciation
at the time of write off.

Leases

The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, 
Leases 
(“ASC 842”).
Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded
on the balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the
lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest
and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest
on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.

In calculating the right-of-use asset and
the lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company excludes
short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes
rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Derivatives

The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine
if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that
are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and would then be revalued at each
reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. If there are stock-based derivative financial
instruments, the Company will use a probability-weighted average series Binomial lattice option pricing models to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. 

The classification of derivative instruments,
including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash
settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Derivative liability will be measured
initially and subsequently at fair value.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:

●

Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer

●

Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

●

Step 3: Determine the transaction price

F-
12

●

Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
    in the contract

●

Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance
    obligation

In order to identify the performance obligations
in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or
service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service
(or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either
on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being
distinct), and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises
in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).

If a good or service is not distinct, the good
or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a distinct bundle of goods or services is identified.

The transaction price is the amount of consideration
to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised
in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity
must consider the effects of all the following:

●

Variable consideration

●

Constraining estimates of variable consideration

●

The existence of a significant financing component in the contract

●

Noncash consideration

●

Consideration payable to a customer

F-
13

Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to
the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty
associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation
on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that
performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time, or over time as appropriate.

Cryptocurrency mining:

The Company entered into contracts with digital
asset mining pool operators to provide the service of performing hash computations for the mining pool operator. The contracts are
continuously renewable and are terminable without penalty at any time by either party. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation
only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company
is entitled to a fractional share of Bitcoin. Hashrate is the measure of the computational power per second used when mining. Since the
contract is continuously renewing, second by second, the mining contract is considered to have a duration of less than 24 hours for accounting
purposes.

Providing computing power in Bitcoin transaction
verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of computing power is the only performance
obligation in the Company’s contracts with third party pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any,
is noncash consideration, which is all variable. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.

The Company earns Bitcoin during a 24 hour cycle
between 00:00:00 UTC and 23:59:59 UTC (“24-hour Period”) unless terminated in accordance with the terms set forth by the
terms of service. The Company performs hash computations for one mining pool operator, Foundry USA. Foundry USA operates its pool on
the Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) payout method. FPPS is a variant of the Pay Per Share (PPS) method, where miners receive a fixed payout
for each valid share submitted, regardless of whether the pool finds a block. 

The fair value of the Bitcoin award received
is determined using the intraday average quoted price of the Bitcoin over the 24-Hour Period. The Company’s Bitcoin earned are
actively traded on the major trading platforms. The Company considers Coinbase to be its primary market. The consideration the Company
will receive, comprised of block rewards, transaction fees less mining pool operator fees are aggregated, over the 24-Hour Period, in
a sub-balance account held by the mining pool operator, which is finalized one hour later at 1:00 AM UTC. The sub-balance account is
then withdrawn to the Company’s whitelisted wallet address, once a day, between the hours of 9am to 5pm UTC time (the “Settlement”).
The rate of payment occurs once per day, as long as the minimum payout threshold of 
0.01
 bitcoin has accumulated in the sub- account
balance, in accordance with the mining pool operator’s terms of service. At the time of Settlement, the company values the
amount of Bitcoin earned. Given that the contract duration is considered less than 24 hours, the Company uses the average Bitcoin price
over the 24 hour period, as quoted by Coinbase, to record the revenue. By utilizing the average daily price of bitcoin over the time
earned, the Company eliminates any differences that may arise due to the volatility in trading price between bitcoin and fiat currency
during the period where the Company establishes and completes the contract.

Pursuant to ASC 606-10-55-42, the Company assessed
if the customer’s option to renew represented a material right that represents a separate performance obligation and noted the
renewal is not a material right. The definition of a material right is a promise in a contract to provide goods or services to a customer
at a price that is significantly lower than the stand-alone selling price of the good or service. The mining pool operator does not provide
any discounts and as such there is no economic benefit to the customer and as such a separate performance obligation does not exist under
606-10-55-42. In addition, there are no options for renewal that are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, such
as an ability to extend the contract at a reduced price.

The performance obligation of the Bitcoin miner
under the mining contracts with Foundry Pool USA involves the service of performing hash computations to facilitate the verification
of digital asset transactions. The Company’s miners contribute computing power (i.e. hashrate) that perform hash calculations to
the mining pool operator, engaging in the process of validating and securing transactions through the generation of Bitcoin hashes. The
mining pool then utilizes a specific mining algorithm (e.g. SHA-256) to submit shares (proof of work) to the mining pool’s server
as they contribute to solving the Bitcoin puzzles required to mine a block. The Company reviews and analyzes its individual pool performance
using a dashboard provided by Foundry Pool USA that includes real-time statistics on hashrate, shares submitted and earnings. The service
of performing hash computations in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities.
The provision of providing these services is the only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining pool operators.

F-
14

Regardless of the pool’s success, the Company
will receive consistent rewards based on the number of valid shares it contributes. The transaction consideration the Company receives
is non-cash consideration, in the form of bitcoin. The Company measures the bitcoin at fair value on the date earned using the average
price (calculated by averaging the daily open price and the daily close price) quoted by its Principal Market at the date the Company
completed the service of performing hash computations for the mining pool operator. There are no deferred revenues or other liability
obligations recorded by the Company since there are no payments in advance of the performance. At the end of each 24 hour period (00:00:00
UTC and 23:59:59 UTC), there are no remaining performance obligations. By utilizing the average daily price of bitcoin on the date earned,
the Company eliminates any differences that may arise due to the volatility in trading price between bitcoin and fiat currency during
the period where the Company establishes and completes the contract. The consideration is all variable. There is no significant financing
component in these transactions.

If authoritative guidance is enacted by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the Company may be required to change its policies, which could affect the Company’s
financial position and results from operations. 

Master service agreement:

The Company entered into an agreement with Sphere
3D to be an exclusive provider of management services for all blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations including but not
limited to services relating to all mining equipment owned, purchased, leased, operated, or otherwise controlled by Sphere 3D and/or
its subsidiaries and/or its affiliates at any location. For such services the Company will receive 
22.5
% of the net operating profit
of all of Sphere 3D’s blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations. The net operating profits in defined as the value
of the digital asset mined less energy cost and profit paid to the host facility.

As Sphere 3D has the ultimate right to determine
the facility location for each machine. The Company has the responsibility for the following:

1)

Ensuring the machines are installed in the facility selected by Sphere.

2)

Selecting and connecting the machines to a mining pool.

3)

To review the mining reports and maintain a wallet for the coins earned
    for the mining operation.

4)

To maintain a custodial wallet for the coins earned from the Sphere
    machines.

5)

To sell and/or transfer the coins at the request of Sphere.

At the time the digital assets are mined, they are transferred into
the custodial wallet maintained by the Company. As of the receipt of the digital asset, the Company has completed its performance obligation,
the transaction price is determinable, net operating profit can be calculated so that the Company can determine its revenue under the
contract; therefore, the Company records as revenue the management fee received. On October 6, 2023, Sphere 3D delivered a termination
notice to the Company with respect to the Sphere MSA. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, on March 7, 2025, the Company entered into a settlement
agreement and release with Sphere 3D. See Note 8– Commitments and Contingencies and Note 13 – Subsequent Events.

Cost of Revenues

The Company’s cost of revenue consists primarily
of direct costs of earning bitcoin related to mining operations, including electric power costs, other utilities, labor, insurance whether
incurred directly from self-mining operations or reimbursed, including any revenue sharing arrangements under co-location agreements,
but excluding depreciation and amortization, which are separately stated in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ASC 606-10-32-25 through 32-27 in the
FASB ASC provides guidance on the consideration of whether fees paid to a mining pool operator should be considered payments to a customer
and treated as a reduction of the transaction price or revenue. The Company’s management reviewed the standards and completed the
following assessment. 

Identifying the Customer: ASC 606-10-32-25 states
that an entity should determine whether the counterparty to a contract is a customer. If the counterparty is a customer, the entity should
apply the revenue recognition guidance to that contract. Under ASC 606-10-32-25, the Company identified the mining pool operator as the
customer as the Company entered into a contractual agreement with the pool operator whereas the Company is to provide services in the
form of contributing hashing power to the pool.

Mining Pool Operator as a Customer: As the Company
has determined the mining pool operator to be a customer, any fees paid to the mining pool operator would be part of the transaction
price of the contract. Any fees paid by the Company as a miner to the pool operator would be revenue earned by the pool operator, and
the pool operator is treated as the customer.

Transaction Price: ASC 606-10-32-26 provides
guidance on determining the transaction price. The Company considered the effects of variable consideration, constraints on variable
consideration, the existence of a significant financing component in the contract, and non-cash consideration. The Company receives
variable consideration given the variable nature of the amount of mining power (hashrate) contributed on a daily basis (24-hour period
per recurring contract term). The Company completes an analytical procedure as part of its monthly closing process to determine the reasonableness
of consideration received. There are no significant financing components of the transaction or delays in the timing of payments from
the customer to the Company, whereas the Company would need to adjust the transaction price for the time value of money. As the Company
receives non-cash consideration, in the form of bitcoin, ASC 606-10-32-26 specifies that the Company should measure non-cash consideration
at fair value. The fair value of the non-cash consideration would be included in the determination of the transaction price. The
Company does not receive the gross amounts of bitcoin earned prior to the transaction fees deduction by the pool operator. As such, the
consideration received is net or inclusive of the transaction fees incurred and charged by the customer (pool operator).

Variable Consideration: If the fees paid
to the mining pool operator are variable, an entity should estimate the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. This involves
considering the likelihood and magnitude of a significant revenue reversal. ASC 606-10-32-26 emphasizes the need to assess whether
there are constraints on variable consideration. In the instance where there is uncertainty about the amount of consideration, it is
reasonable for the Company to consider a likelihood of a significant reversal of revenue. The Company reviews daily bitcoin rewards received
and reviews various factors, such as mining difficulty, the price of bitcoin and the Company’s contribution to the pool operator.
The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration the Company should receive and prepares a monthly workpaper documenting the
difference in actual bitcoin rewards received vs. estimated bitcoin earned. The Company assessed, given the pool operators payout methodology
and the revenue reasonableness test completed by management, there does not exist a likelihood of a significant reversal of revenue.

Reduction of Transaction Price: ASC 606-10-32-27 states
that an entity should reduce the transaction price for variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant
revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company assessed various factors, identifying the
variable consideration, estimating the variable consideration, considered constraints (although none existed such as performance metrics
or targets), probability, documentation, regular review and monitoring of performance with open communication with pool operators combined
with dashboard usage. Due to the Company utilizing Foundry Pool’s FPPS methodology and the previous mentioned factors, there was
zero likelihood of a significant reversal of revenue as the Company receives payouts as a pool participant on a daily basis calculated
from midnight-to-midnight UTC time, regardless of if the Pool Operator receives any block rewards.

In summary, fees paid to the mining pool operator
are considered payments to a customer and treated as a reduction of the transaction price/revenue. The Company has carefully assessed
the variable nature of these fees, considered the likelihood and magnitude of any potential adjustments, and documented that management
has applied the revenue recognition guidance accordingly.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for our stock-based compensation under
ASC 718 “
Compensation – Stock Compensation
” using the fair value-based method. Under this method, compensation
cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting
period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for
goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based
on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments, or the issuance of those equity instruments may settle that.

We use the fair value method for equity instruments
granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options. The stock-based fair value compensation
is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is
recognized over the vesting periods.

Common stock awards

The Company has granted common stock awards to
non-employees in exchange for services provided. The Company measures the fair value of these awards using the fair value of the services
provided or the fair value of the awards granted, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value measurement date of these awards
is generally the date the performance of services is complete. The fair value of the awards is recognized on a straight-line basis as
services are rendered. The share-based payments related to common stock awards for the settlement of services provided by non-employees
are recorded in accordance with ASC 718 on the statement of operations in the same manner and charged to the same account as if such
settlements had been made in cash.

Warrants

In connection with certain financing, consulting,
and collaboration arrangements, the Company has issued warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. The outstanding warrants are
standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the holder and are classified as equity awards. The Company
measures the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the measurement date. Warrants issued in conjunction
with the issuance of common stock are initially recorded at fair value as a reduction in additional paid-in capital of the common stock
issued. All other warrants are recorded at fair value as expense over the requisite service period or at the date of issuance if there
is not a service period.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the
asset and liability method, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is required to the extent any deferred tax assets may not be realizable.

ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, (“ASC 740”),
also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes
a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure, and transition. Based on the Company’s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain
tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s financial statements. The Company believes that its income tax positions and
deductions would be sustained at the audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in material changes to its financial
position.

Earnings Per Share

The Company uses ASC 260, “Earnings Per
Share” for calculating the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. The Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share by
dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed
based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and warrants and stock
awards. For periods with a net loss, basic and diluted loss per share is the same, in that any potential common stock equivalents would
have the effect of being anti-dilutive in the computation of net loss per share.

Securities that could potentially dilute loss
per share in the future were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents, consisting of non-penny stock warrants and unvested RSUs, amounted
to 
10,150,709
 shares and 
10,958,876
 shares as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company’s management reviewed all recently
issued accounting standard updates (“ASU’s”) not yet adopted by the Company and does not believe the future adoptions
of any such ASU’s may be expected to cause a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or the results
of its operations, except for the following.

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06,
Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The
amendments in this Update modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the Codification. Certain of the
amendments represent clarifications to, or technical corrections of the current requirements. Each amendment in the ASU will only become
effective if the SEC removes the related disclosure or presentation requirement from its existing regulations by June 30, 2027. We are
currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the provisions of the ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. The
amendments in this ASU are not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
“Segment Reporting (ASC Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The amendments require the disclosure
of significant segment expenses as well as expanded interim disclosures, along with other changes to segment disclosure requirements.
The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning on or after December
15, 2024. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the fourth quarter of 2024, which did not have a material impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.
2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires entities
to disclose specific rate reconciliations, amount of income taxes separated by federal and individual jurisdiction, and the amount of
income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) disaggregated between federal, state, and foreign. The new
standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, 
Intangible - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic
350-60)
 (“ASC 350-60”). ASC 350-60 requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure such assets
at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. Crypto assets that meet all the following
criteria are within the scope of the ASC 350-60:

(1)

meet the definition of intangible assets as defined in the Codification;

(2)

do not provide the asset holder with enforceable rights to or claims
    on underlying goods, services, or other assets;

(3)

are created or reside on a distributed ledger based on blockchain or
    similar technology;

(4)

are secured through cryptography;

(5)

are fungible; and

(6)

are not created or issued by the reporting entity or its related parties.
    In addition, entities are required to provide additional disclosures about the holdings of certain crypto assets.

F-
18

Bitcoin, which is the sole crypto asset mined
by the Company, meets each of these criteria. For all entities, the ASC 350-60 amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements
that have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt
them as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company has elected to early adopt the new guidance
effective January 1, 2024 resulting in a $
740,000
 cumulative-effect change to adjust the Company’s bitcoin held on January
1, 2024 with the corresponding entry to beginning accumulated deficit. 

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
“Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)”. The amendments
require the disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses including purchases of inventory, employee compensation,
depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil and gas producing
activities. It also requires the disclosure of a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are
not separately disaggregated quantitatively as well as the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s
definition of selling expenses. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2027.
 We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the provisions of the ASU will
have on our consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the provisions of the ASU
will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Adoption of ASU 2023-08, Accounting for and
Disclosure of Crypto Assets

Effective January 1, 2024, the Company early
adopted ASU 2023-08, which requires entities to ‘measure crypto assets at fair value with changes recognized in the consolidated
statement of operation each reporting period. The Company’s digital assets are within the scope of ASU 2023-08 and the transition
guidance requires a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the current fiscal year for any difference between the carrying
amount of the Company’s digital assets and fair value. As a result of the Company’s early adoption of ASU 2023-08, the Company
recorded a $
740,000
 increase in digital assets and a $
740,000
 decrease in accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheets
as of January 1, 2024.

NOTE 3 – MARKETABLE SECURITIES

In accordance with the Agreement and Plan

933.333333
 Bitcoin (“BTC”) at an annual interest rate of 
5
%.

The BTC Note is secured by (1) 7,200 S19j
Pros ASIC miners used for Bitcoin mining, (2) The Colocation Mining Services Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2022, by and between
the Company and Coinmint, and (3) The Contribution Agreement, dated as of May 25, 2022, by and between Borrower and the Lender.

The Company evaluated the BTC Note in accordance
with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that the BTC Note will require derivative
accounting and will be adjusted to fair value every reporting period. The fair value is determined by using the lowest day trading value,
as of the reporting date, as disclosed on Yahoo Finance.

On March 29, 2023, the Company and the Lender
entered into the Amended and Restated Promissory Note (the “Amended BTC Note”). The maturity date was extended from May 2024
to March 2026, and the interest rate was increased to 
6
% per annum, to be applied to the number of bitcoins remaining to be paid
at the beginning of each month.

The monthly principal and interest payments,
starting with the April 2023 payment, have been adjusted to be 
100
% of net monthly mining revenue, defined as, for each calendar
month, the sum of (a) all of Borrower’s revenue generated from all Bitcoin generated by the Borrower with the Collateral (as defined
in the BTC Note) 
less 
(b) the sum of the Borrower’s  direct and indirect general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”)
in connection with Bitcoin mining operations, but not to exceed the greater of (x) $
100,000
 and (y) the amount that is previously
preapproved by the Lender in writing for such calendar month; provided, however that, to the extent that SG&A is capped by clause
(b) above, any unapplied SG&A may be rolled forward to subsequent months until fully deducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
otherwise approved by Lender, the aggregate amount of SG&A during any rolling twelve-month period shall not exceed $
750,000
, provided
that if at the end of a fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023, if (x) the aggregate principal amount
payment received by the Lender for such fiscal quarter exceeds 
38.6363638
 Bitcoin and (y) the average principal amount payment received
by the Lender for each fiscal quarter (commencing fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2023 and through and including the fiscal quarter for
which such determination is to be made) exceeds 
38.6363638
 Bitcoin per fiscal quarter, then, the Borrower shall pay to the
Lender 
75
% of Net Monthly Mining Revenue (as defined in the Amendment) for the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter (and thereafter,
in the following fiscal quarter would shift to 
100
%). In the event that the Net Monthly Mining Revenue for any month is insufficient
to cover interest payment under the BTC Note, such deficiency shall be deemed paid-in-kind by capitalizing such deficiency in interest
payment and adding such amount to the principal amount of indebtedness under the BTC Note. 

Also, as part of the Amendment, the Company has
agreed not to convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of any of the Company’s digital assets outside of the
ordinary course of business. 

Additionally, the Company is required thereunder
to maintain a collateral (mining equipment and digital assets) coverage ratio of 
110
% (“Collateral Coverage Ratio”).
A breach of the Collateral Coverage Ratio shall not be deemed to have occurred until the lender has provided notice to the Company of
such breach. If the Collateral Coverage Ratio decreases below 
110
%, the Company will have to provide the lender with additional
collateral in the form of bitcoin, U.S. dollars, or additional equipment. If the Company is unable to do so, the Company may default
on the BTC Note, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not in breach of the Collateral Coverage Ratio.

The Amendment also added a conversion provision
whereby the lender has a limited right to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal on the BTC Note into a number of shares
of the Company (the “Conversion Right”). The Conversion Right is available at any time during the one-month period (the “Conversion
Period”) after which the market capitalization of the Company for the first time exceeds $
125,000,000
 for five consecutive days.
The conversion price is equal to $
150,000,000
 divided by the number of shares of Company common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the lender’s exercise of the Conversion Right during the Conversion Period.

As consideration for the Amendment, the Company
agreed to make a one-time payment of 
173.17
 bitcoins, which had a fair value of approximately $
4,856,000
 on the date of
payment, therefore, reducing the principal balance of bitcoins from 
636.81
 to 
463.64
, and a closing fee of $
104,000
, which
was offset with the adjustment for the change in fair value, as defined under debt modification accounting.

The Company has evaluated the Amendment in accordance
with ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishments. The change in the interest rate from 
5.0
% to 
6.0
% caused there to be a significant
change in the cashflows of the BTC Note. Also, given that the BTC Note carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, any gain
on loss from the extinguishment would be adjusted through the change in fair value as of September 30, 2024.

On October 25, 2024 (“Exchange Date”),
the Company, its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as applicable and the Lender entered into a Debt Repayment and Exchange Agreement (the
“DRE Agreement”), Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement (the “New Loan Agreement”), the Pre-funded Warrants (as
defined below) and the $
1.50
 Warrants (as defined below) (collectively, the “Agreements”) to extinguish and terminate the
Amended BTC Note (the “Exchange”).

F-
24

Pursuant to the Agreements, the following consideration was exchanged
with the Lender for the settlement of the Amended BTC Note:

●
Approximately $
9,117,000
 of the Amended BTC Note principal balance was converted into shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares Exchanged”), at an ascribed value of $
1.10
 per share resulting in the issuance of 
8,287,984
 shares of common stock to Lender, at a fair market value of $
0.612
 per share (the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock on the Restructuring Date), or an aggregate value of approximately $
5,072,000
.

●
Warrants to purchase 
3,530,198
 shares of common stock, which warrants are exercisable immediately, have a 
ten
-year term and an exercise price of $
0.01
 per share (the “Prefunded Warrants”), at a fair market value of $
0.612
 per share (the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock on the Restructuring Date), or an aggregate value of approximately $
2,160,000
.

●
Warrants to purchase 
2,000,000
 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $
1.50
 per share (the $
1.50
 warrants) which will expire in five-years from the date of the transaction for a total fair value of approximately $
888,000
 based on the Black Scholes fair value option-pricing model with key input variables provided by management, as of the date of issuance: volatility of 
115.0
%, the fair value of common stock $
0.612
 estimated life of 
5.0
 years, risk-free rate of 
4.07
% to 
4.72
% and dividend rate of 
nil
.

●
A $
5,000,000
 note payable (the “Note Payable”) pursuant to the New Loan Agreement.

●
A director specified by Lender was added to the board of directors.

The terms of the Note Payable include the following:

●
The outstanding principal and interest are denominated in dollars
                                            (as opposed to the original Bitcoin Loan that was denominated in bitcoin).

●
One-time payment of in the amount of $
5,000,000
 on October 25, 2027

●
Annual interest rate of 
4.25
% payable monthly.

●
The Lender has been given a first priority lien on all the Company
                                            and its subsidiaries’ assets.

●
The Lender may convert half of the outstanding principal at a price of $
1.10
 per share of common stock and the remaining half at a price of $
1.50
 per share of common stock (for purposes of classifying the Restructured Loan, it was concluded that the conversion option did not meet the requirements to be bifurcated and classified as a derivative, nor was there a large premium paid that would be classified as an addition to paid-in capital so the conversion option is included in the value of the host instrument).

●
The Note Payable cannot be converted or exercised if the Lender and its affiliates would beneficially own more than 
19.99
% of the number of shares of common stock as of the date of the agreement after giving effect to such conversion or exercise without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, for which the Company is required to seek such approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders.

The Company has evaluated the accounting for the Exchange using the
guidance as outlined in ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors (“ASC 470”). ASC 470 defines a troubled debt restructuring
when a creditor, due to a debtor’s financial difficulties, grants the debtor a concession that it would not otherwise consider.
As of the Exchange Date, the Company’s most recent financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, were issued with a going concern
exception, and the Company was not earning a sufficient number of Bitcoins to satisfy the monthly interest payments, therefore adding
to the principal balance the interest deficiency. Both of these factors would qualify, under ASC 470, that the Company was in financial
difficulties, at the Exchange date. The second qualification refers to the lender granting a concession. ASC 470 defines a concession
as being a reduction in the effective interest rate of the new loan. The Company determined that the Amended BTC Note’s effective
interest was higher than the effective interest rate of the Note Payable.

F-
25

The Company has determined that the Exchange is accounted for as a
troubled debt restructuring with the Note Payable in the amount of $
5,638,000
 and a resulting gain of approximately $
6,248,000
, calculated
as follows:

Book value - Amended BTC Note

$
20,236,000

Fair value of Shares Exchanged

(
5,072,000
)

Fair value of $
1.5
 Warrants

(
888,000

Fair value - Prefunded Warrants

Remaining value - Amended BTC Note

12,116,000

Note Payable – Principal

5,000,000

Difference

$
(
7,116,000
)

Since the Note Payable balance is less than the remaining balance
of the Amended BTC Note, the Company recorded the Note Payable in the aggregate of the principal and interest calculated over the life
of the loan with a corresponding gain as follows:

Principal - Note Payable

$
5,000,000

Interest payments - Note Payable

638,000

Undiscounted cashflow

(

For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized
interest expense amounting to $
914,000
 and $
758,000
, respectively, for the bitcoin denominated note payable.

Employment Agreements

CEO Agreements

On January 14, 2021, the Company entered into
a consulting agreement (“Consulting Agreement”) with Chang Advisory Inc. for Robby Chang (“Consultant”), to serve
as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors. On September 17, 2024, the Consultant was terminated
as Chief Executive Officer.

On September 17, 2024,
the Company entered into an executive employment CEO Agreement with Steve Gutterman (the “CEO Agreement”), pursuant to which
Mr. Gutterman will serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reporting to the Company’s Board. The CEO Agreement has
a three-year term that may be renewed for successive one-year periods by written agreement. 

The CEO Agreement provides
for (A) a $
450,000
 annual base salary paid in accordance with our normal payroll practices and which may be increased by in the discretion
of the Company’s board of directors (“Board”), but not reduced, (B) for 2024, a pro-rated bonus based on the Company’s
and/or Mr. Gutterman’s achievement of performance goals, with the sum of the 2024 and 2025 bonuses being no less than 
40
% of Mr.
Gutterman’s base salary, (C) a target annual bonus beginning in 2025 equal to 
100
% of base salary, with the actual amount of such
bonus determined by the discretion of the Board, based on the achievement of individual and/or Company performance goals determined by
our Board and payable on the date annual bonuses are paid to our other senior executives, but in no event later than March 15th and conditioned
upon Mr. Gutterman’s continued employment through the payment date, (D) a target annual stock bonus beginning in 2025 equal to

100
% of Mr. Gutterman’s base salary, which may be paid in the Company’s performance stock units or restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) and which shall be subject to vesting conditions following the grant of such units, (E) a recommendation to the
Board that the Board make a sign-on equity grant valued at $
1,000,000
 in the form RSUs calculated using a 30 day VWAP, which was $
0.598
,
for a total of 
1,671,681
 shares. One-third of the RSUs vest on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date for a total of 
1,114,454

RSUs (“Time-based RSUs”) and the remaining one-third of 
557,228
 RSUs vest upon the Company’s remediation of certain
stock exchange listing qualification failures that exist as of the effective date of the CEO Agreement (see below “Contingencies”
for further explanation of the qualification failures) (“Market-based RSUs”), and (F) eligibility to participate in customary
health, welfare, and fringe benefit plans we provide to our employees.

On September 30, 2024, the grant date, the Company’s
board of directors approved the issuance of the RSUs, pursuant to the CEO Agreement. The Company relied on guidance set by FASB Accounting
Standards Update No. 2021-07 (issued and updated on October 2021) related to Compensation – Stock Compensation (“Topic 718”)
to determine the impact on the Company. The grant date fair value for the 
1,114,454
 Time-based RSUs was estimated to be approximately
$
735,000
 based on the Company’s closing price of $
0.66
 as of the grant date. The Company will recognize expense on a straight-line
basis over the service period starting October 1, 2024. The remaining 
557,228
 Market-based RSUs were considered to have a market-based
vesting as the milestones are based on the Company’s remediation of certain stock exchange listing qualifications, which are based
on the market price and market capitalization of the Company’s common stock. As further required by Topic 718, a market-based award’s
fair value is required to be expensed over the derived service period whether the milestone is met or not. The Company hired a third-party
valuation firm to calculate the fair value of the Market-based Awards. The fair value of approximately $
312,000
 was determined by the
use of a Monte-Carlo simulation model (i) over the period from September 30, 2024 through August 31, 2025 (the estimated date to achieve
the remediation of the Nasdaq deficiencies over the period set forth in the CEO Agreement), (ii) a risk-free rate of 
4.0
%, (iii) volatility
of 
152.0
%, (iv) a starting price of $
0.68
, (v) a price hurdle $
1.00
 and (vi) a time hurdle of 
10
 days, for a derived fair value of $
0.56

per share and a derived service period of approximately 
0.33
 years.

F-

The CEO Agreement also
provides Mr. Gutterman with the opportunity to earn an incentive bonus (the “Incentive Bonus”), with will become payable,
if ever, in tranches following the Company’s attainment of certain stock price and market capitalization goals. The specific goals
are as follows:

Company Stock

No Incentive Bonus tranche
will become payable unless both the stock price goal and the market capitalization goal (“Goals’) for the applicable tranche
are satisfied, and the market capitalization goal is attained simultaneously with the stock price goal. Additionally, the Incentive Bonus
may be earned in a change in control if the consideration paid per share of Company common stock exceeds an Incentive Bonus tranche stock
price goal and the total value received in the transaction exceeds an Incentive Bonus tranche market capitalization goal. Under no circumstances
may the performance goals for an Incentive Bonus tranche be achieved more than one time. The Incentive Bonus, to the extent any tranche
becomes payable, will be paid within thirty days of the attainment of the applicable goals, subject to Mr. Gutterman remaining in continuous
employment with the Company through each payment date. The Company will continue to evaluate the probability of the CEO’s achievement
of the Goals. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not accrued for the Incentive Bonus.

All bonuses payable
under the CEO Agreement, except the stock bonus, may be paid in cash, Bitcoin, Company equity, or a mix of any of the foregoing.

Under the CEO Agreement,
Mr. Gutterman will be entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits upon a termination of his employment by the Company
without “cause”, by Mr. Gutterman for “good reason” (each, as defined in the CEO Agreement and collectively,
a “Qualifying Termination”), that does not occur in connection with a change in control:

(1)

the Accrued Obligations (as defined in the CEO Agreement),

(2)

Mr. Gutterman’s annual base salary, and

(3)

the product of (x) 12 and (y) Mr. Gutterman’s monthly cost for
    health and welfare benefits pursuant to his elections under the Company’s health and welfare benefit plans, as in effect on
    the termination date (collectively, the “Non-CIC Severance”)

The Non-CIC Severance will be paid in a lump
sum as soon as practicable following the effective date of a release but no later than 74 days following Mr. Gutterman’s termination.
If Mr. Gutterman incurs a Qualifying Termination within 30 days prior to or 12 months following a change in control, then in addition
to the Non-CIC Severance, Mr. Gutterman will be entitled to the following:

(4)

An amount equal to 0.5 times Mr. Gutterman’s target bonus and

(5)

acceleration and vesting on a prorated basis (performance goals will be assumed to have been achieved
    at target) of each outstanding equity award held by Mr. Gutterman as of the termination date (but excluding the Incentive Bonus)
    (collectively, the “CIC Severance”).

To the extent payable
in cash, the CIC Severance will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the effective date of a release, but no later
than 74 days after Mr. Gutterman’s termination date. The severance payments and benefits described above are subject to Mr. Gutterman’s
execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance with his restrictive covenant
obligations.

The CEO Agreement includes
certain restrictive covenants, which include non-solicitation and non-competition covenants during the term of the CEO Agreement and
for the 12 months following. Further, the CEO Agreement includes a “best pay” provision under Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code, pursuant to which any “parachute payments” that become payable to Mr. Gutterman will either be paid in full
or reduced so that such payments are not subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever results
in the better after-tax treatment to Mr. Gutterman.

Sphere 3D MSA

On August 19, 2021, Gryphon entered into
a Master Services Agreement (the “Sphere MSA”) with Sphere 3D. The Sphere 3D MSA has a term of three years, beginning
on August 19, 2021, and terminating on August 18, 2024, with one-year automatic renewal terms thereafter. Under the Sphere
MSA, Gryphon is Sphere 3D’s exclusive provider of management services for all blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations,
including but not limited to services relating to all mining equipment owned, purchased, leased, operated, or otherwise controlled by
Sphere 3D and/or its subsidiaries and/or its affiliates at any location, with Gryphon receiving a percentage of the net operating profit
of all of Sphere 3D’s blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations.

On December 29, 2021, the Company and Sphere
3D entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Sphere 3D MSA, to provide greater certainty as to the term of the Sphere 3D MSA. Sphere 3D and
Gryphon agreed to extend the initial term of the Sphere 3D MSA from three to four years, or to five years in the event Sphere 3D does
not receive delivery of a specified minimum number of Bitcoin mining machines during 2022.

The cryptocurrency earned from the Sphere 3D’s
mining operations is held in a wallet, in which the Company holds the cryptographic key information and maintains the internal recordkeeping
of the cryptocurrency. The Company’s contractual arrangements state that Sphere 3D retains legal ownership of the cryptocurrency;
has the right to sell, pledge, or transfer the cryptocurrency; and benefits from the rewards and bears the risks associated with the
ownership, including as a result of any cryptocurrency price fluctuations. The Sphere also bears the risk of loss as a result of fraud
or theft unless the loss was caused by the Company’s gross negligence or the Company’s willful misconduct. The Company does
not use any of the cryptocurrency resulting from the Sphere 3D MSA as collateral for any of the Company’s loans or other financing
arrangements, nor does it lend, or pledge cryptocurrency held for Sphere. 

A threat actor representing to be the Sphere 3D
CFO inserted themselves into an email exchange between the Sphere 3D CFO and the Company’s former CEO, which also included Sphere
3D’s CEO, regarding the transfer of Sphere 3D’s BTC from the Company’s wallet to Sphere 3D’s wallet. The threat
actor requested that the BTC be transferred to an alternate wallet. As a result, 26 BTC, with a value of approximately $
560,000
 at
the time, was transferred to a wallet controlled by the threat actor. Via counsel, Gryphon engaged with US Federal law enforcement to
recover the BTC. Despite these attempts by law enforcement to recover the BTC, recovery was not possible. Gryphon subsequently wired
the commensurate amount in USD to Sphere 3D to make them whole for the stolen BTC. Gryphon also engaged a nationally recognized third-party firm
to perform a forensic analysis. The analysis revealed that the threat actor did not enter the email exchange via Gryphon’s IT systems.
Sphere 3D made a claim with its insurance carrier. If Sphere 3D is reimbursed by its insurance carrier, the Company would request reimbursement
from Sphere 3D. The Company has also subsequently modified its control systems to protect against any future attempted incursions.
As of March 31, 2023, the Company made the payment to Sphere 3D for $
560,000
, which was classified as a general and administrative expense
on the consolidated statement of operations.

On April 7, 2023, Sphere 3D filed suit against
Gryphon in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit concerns the Sphere MSA between the parties where the Company agreed to act
as Sphere 3D’s “exclusive provider of any and all management services for all blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations.”
Sphere 3D alleges that the Company has fallen short in its obligations under the Sphere MSA, and is suing for alleged breach of contract,
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty (such matter, the “Sphere 3D Litigation”).

On June 15, 2023, Sphere 3D filed an amended
complaint in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which clarified certain of Sphere 3D’s prior allegations. On June 28, 2023,
the Company requested leave to file a motion to dismiss Sphere 3D’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which the Court granted on August 11, 2023. On August 18, 2023, the Company filed: (i) its motion
to dismiss Sphere 3D’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and
(ii) its answer and counterclaims against Sphere 3D, asserting, among other things, that Sphere had breached the Sphere MSA, breached
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in connection with that contract, acted negligently in connection with a separate
incident, and defamed the Company. The Company’s answer and counterclaims further asserted the defamation counterclaim against
Sphere 3D’s Chief Executive Officer, Patricia Trompeter, personally.

F-

On September 20, 2023, Sphere 3D filed a second
amended complaint in connection with the Sphere 3D Litigation, which added a claim against the Company alleging that the Company’s
counterclaim for defamation against Sphere 3D violated New York’s anti-SLAPP law.

On October 6, 2023, Sphere 3D delivered a termination
notice to the Company with respect to the Sphere MSA, largely on the basis of the allegations made by Sphere 3D in the Sphere 3D Litigation
(the “Sphere 3D MSA Termination”). On October 11, 2023, the Company filed an answer to Sphere 3D’s second amended complaint,
in which, among other things, the Company alleged that Sphere 3D’s attempted termination of the Sphere MSA was wrongful and ineffective,
because it violated the terms of the Sphere MSA, and thus that Sphere 3D continues to owe the Company all amounts to which it would otherwise
be entitled under the Sphere MSA through that contract’s term ending in August 2026.

On March 15, 2024, the Company has collected
all outstanding balances associated with the direct pass-through of costs as well as management revenues billed through October 6, 2023
associated with hosting Sphere 3D’s miners at the Coinmint and Core facility previously held as Accounts Receivable as of December
31, 2023.

During Q1 2024, the Company remitted all digital
assets held for other parties and restricted cash to Sphere 3D. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held approximately 
0
 and 
21.47
 bitcoin,
respectively, with a value of approximately 
$0
 and $
908,000
, respectively, classified as digital assets held for other parties
on the balance sheet. Also, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held approximately 
$0
 and $
8,000
, respectively of
cash generated from the sale of Sphere 3D BTC, to be used to make payments related to the Sphere MSA, classified as restricted cash on
the balance sheet. 

Subsequent to year end, on March 7, 2025, The Company and Sphere 3D
entered into a settlement and release agreement on mutually acceptable terms. The Settlement Agreement fully resolved all pending litigation
between the Company and Sphere, and each party fully released the other party from any known or unknown and unsuspected claims. The Settlement
Agreement further provided that each party will bear its own costs in connection with the litigation. See Note 13 – Subsequent Events.

Contingencies

The Company is subject at times to various claims,
lawsuits, and governmental proceedings relating to the Company’s business and transactions arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Company cannot predict the final outcome of such proceedings. Where appropriate, the Company vigorously defends such claims, lawsuits,
and proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and proceedings seek damages, including, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages,
in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. Certain of the claims, lawsuits, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business are covered by the Company’s insurance program. The Company maintains the property and various types of liability insurance
in an effort to protect the Company from such claims. In terms of any matters where there is no insurance coverage available to the Company,
or where coverage is available and the Company maintains a retention or deductible associated with such insurance, the Company may establish
an accrual for such loss, retention, or deductible based on currently available information. In accordance with accounting guidance,
if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements, and the
amount of loss is reasonably estimable, then an accrual for the cost to resolve or settle these claims is recorded by the Company in
the accompanying balance sheets. If it is reasonably possible that an asset may be impaired as of the date of the financial statement,
then the Company discloses the range of possible loss. Expenses related to the defense of such claims are recorded by the Company as
incurred and included in the accompanying statements of operations. Management, with the assistance of outside counsel, may, from time
to time adjust such accruals according to new developments in the matter, court rulings, or changes in the strategy affecting the Company’s
defense of such matters. On the basis of current information, the Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility that other
than with regard to the Class Action described below, any material loss, if any, will result from any claims, lawsuits, and proceedings
to which the Company is subject to either individually, or in the aggregate.

The Company determines the fair value of its
assets and liabilities based on the quoted market prices as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the marketable securities the market value
is based on the quoted market price on the US exchange. For the digital assets and BTC Note, the Company used the quoted market price
per Coinbase.

NOTE 11 – REVERSE MERGER

As described in Note 1, Legacy Ivy merged with
Akerna on February 9, 2024. The merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization with Legacy Ivy as the accounting acquirer. The
primary pre-combination assets of Akerna were cash and cash equivalents. Under reverse recapitalization accounting, the assets and liabilities
of Akerna were recorded at their fair value which approximated book value due to the short-term nature of the accounts. No goodwill or
intangible assets were recognized. Consequently, the consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the operations of Legacy
Ivy for accounting purposes, together with a deemed issuance of shares equivalent to the shares held by the former stockholders of Akerna,
the legal acquirer, and a recapitalization of the equity of Legacy Ivy, the accounting acquirer.

As part of the reverse recapitalization, the Company acquired $
500,000
 of
cash and cash equivalents. The Company also assumed accounts payable and accrued expenses of $
2.8
 million and the net book value
is recorded in additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit) for the
year ended December 31, 2024. Akerna’s operation had ceased concurrent with the merger and were deemed to be de minimis in value
at the transaction date.

NOTE 12 – INCOME TAXES

For the period ended December 31, 2024 the Company
generated no current income taxes due to the Company generating net operating losses whereas for the period ended December 31, 2023,
the Company generated a current tax benefit of ($
176,000
). Additionally, no deferred income taxes have been recorded due to the uncertainty
of the realization of any tax assets. On December 31, 2024, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available
to offset future taxable income of approximately $
38,580,000
. For federal purposes, there is an unlimited carryforward period, and for
state purposes, the net operating losses begin to expire in 2041.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed
by applying the federal and state income tax rates in effect to the gross amounts of temporary differences and other tax attributes,
such as net operating loss carryforwards. In assessing if the deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considers whether it
is more likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which these deductible temporary differences reverse.

For financial reporting purposes, the Company
has incurred a loss in each period since its inception. Based on all available evidence, including the Company’s history of losses,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company
provided for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets on December 31, 2024, and 2023. During the years ended December
31, 2024, and 2023, the valuation allowance increased by $
4,275,000
 and $
6,608,000
, respectively. The increase was attributable to the
increase in our net operating loss carryforwards and several other deferred tax assets. The total valuation allowance results from the
Company’s estimate of its inability to recover its net deferred tax assets.

On December 31, 2024, the Company has federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards, which are available to offset future taxable income, of approximately $
38,580,000
 which for
federal purposes has an unlimited carryforward period and begins to expire in 2041 for state purposes. These carryforwards may be subject
to an annual limitation under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions if the Company experienced
one or more ownership changes that would limit the amount of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable
income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Sections 382 and 383, results from transactions increasing
ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of the corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year
period. The Company has not completed an IRC Section 382/383 analysis. If a change in ownership were to have occurred, NOL and tax credit
carryforwards could be eliminated or restricted. If eliminated, the related asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule
with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by future
ownership changes, if any, will not impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

F-
38

The Company files income tax returns in the United
States and various state jurisdictions. Due to the Company’s carryforward of net operating losses all tax years are open and subject
to income tax examination by tax authorities. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expenses and penalties related to income
tax matters as a tax expenses. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there are no unrecognized tax benefits, and there are no significant
accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties.

The Company is in the process of analyzing its
NOL and has not determined if the company has had any change of control issues that could limit the future use of NOL. The NOL carryforwards
that were generated after 2017 of approximately $
38,580,000
 may only be used to offset 
80
% of future taxable income and are carried forward
indefinitely.

NOTE 13 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Company has evaluated all events that occurred
after the balance sheet date through the date when the financial statements were issued to determine if they must be reported. The management
of the Company determined there are no reportable events for the year ended December 31, 2024, except for the following.

Issuance of shares of common stock

In January 2025, the
Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with several institutional and accredited
investors and certain directors and officers of the Company (and certain of their affiliated parties) for the purpose of raising approximately
$
2,820,000
 in gross proceeds for the Company. Of the gross proceeds, approximately $
670,000
 was received in December 2024 with approximately
$
2,150,000

75,000
 associated with the Purchase Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold in a registered direct offering an aggregate of (i) 
6,941,856
 shares
(the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.00001

6,941,856
 shares
of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $
1.50
 per share, at a combined purchase price per share and accompanying warrant
equal to $
0.40
 for third-party investors and $
0.516
 for directors and officers of the Company.

In January 2025, the Company raised net proceeds
of approximately $
2,336,000
 from the ATM for the issuance of 
4,563,552
 shares.

In January 2025, the Company entered into an investor
relations consulting agreement. The agreement is for a period of six months with equal monthly payments of $
12,500
 and the issuance of

350,000

series machines with an extended warranty. The purchase price was a cash payment of approximately $
608,000

100,000

of the Company’s common stock. As of March 31, 2025, the Company paid $
558,000

Potential acquisitions

Captus Energy

On January 8, 2025, the
Company and Alberta Ltd., entered into a Share and Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Captus Agreement”) with BTG Energy Corp.,
a Canadian corporation (“BTG Energy”), BTG Power Corp., a Canadian corporation (“BTG Power”) and West Lake Energy
Corp., a Canadian corporation (“West Lake,” and together with BTG Energy and BTG Power, the “Vendors”). Pursuant
to the Captus Agreement, the Company will acquire from the Vendors all of the issued and outstanding shares or units, as applicable, of
(i) Captus Generation Ltd. (“Captus GP”) and BowArk Energy Ltd., each a Canadian corporation, and (ii) Captus General Limited
Partnership, a Canadian limited partnership (collectively “Captus Energy,” and the transaction contemplated by the Captus
Agreement, the “Captus Acquisition”).

F-
39

Captus GP owns 850 acres in Pincher Creek, Alberta
(the “Captus Site”). The acreage contains characteristics management considers to be highly suitable for the development of
AI HPC. These characteristics include: 1) redundant natural gas lines, 2) grid connectivity, 3) a deplete reservoir that can be used for
onsite carbon sequestration, 4) access to non-potable water and 5) proximity to telecom connectivity. Gryphon intends to develop the site
for revenue producing activities.

The aggregate consideration
payable by the Company to the Vendors is CAD $
24.0
 million (the “Cash Consideration”), subject to adjustment in accordance
with the terms of the Captus Agreement. In November 2024, the Company paid a cash deposit of $
143,759
 (CAD $
200,000
) to Captus GP for
the benefit of the Vendors (the “LOI Cash Deposit”). Within two business days of the date of the Captus Agreement, the Company
paid a cash deposit of $
704,641
 (CAD $
1,000,000
) to Captus GP for the benefit of the Vendors (the “Signing Cash Deposit,”
and together with the LOI Cash Deposit, the “Cash Deposits”). The Cash Deposits may be applied towards the payment of the
Cash Consideration in accordance with the terms of the Captus Agreement, and the remainder of the Cash Consideration will be paid by the
Company upon closing.

The transaction remains
subject to certain conditions, including the transfer and assignment of certain agreements from the Vendors to the Company. Pending approval
by the Alberta Energy Regulator, BTG Energy and West Lake will hold certain well, pipeline and facility licenses in trust for an agreed
fee.

In connection with the
Captus Agreement, on January 8, 2025, as a material inducement to their agreeing to become employees of the Company, the Company granted
a restricted stock award to each of Harry Andersen, Paul Connolly, Mark Taylor and Steve Giacomin (collectively, the “Restricted
Stock Awards”). The Restricted Stock Awards were intended to constitute “employment inducement awards” under the Nasdaq
Stock Market Rules. The aggregate restricted stock shares issued was 
4,083,003
.

Each of the Restricted
Stock Awards vests in three equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date subject to the grantee’s continued
engagement with the Company through each applicable vesting date, provided however, that the Restricted Stock Awards will accelerate and
vest immediately upon the grantee’s death, disability, termination by the Company without “cause” (as defined in each
Restricted Stock Award agreement), or the consummation of a change in control of the Company.

On March 19, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
the execution of a strategic advisory business service agreement (“Advisory Agreement’) with Bower Four Capital Corp. Pursuant
to the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor will provide general strategic advice and guidance regarding the Company’s business, proposed
transactions and M&A activity. The term of the agreement will be for a period of thirty-six months subject to renewal for one or more
additional six-month periods. If the Captus Acquisition closes, the Company will be required to issue 
6,000,000
 shares of the Company’s
common stock and a warrant to purchase 
6,000,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock at $
0.50
 per share. As of March 31, 2025,
the Advisory Agreement has not been executed by the parties thereto.

Erikson Purchase Agreement

On February 14, 2025, the Company gave Erikson notice of the cancellation
of the Erikson Purchase Agreement.

Litigation 

On March 7, 2025, The Company and Sphere 3D entered
into a settlement and release agreement on mutually acceptable terms. The Settlement Agreement fully resolved all pending litigation between
the Company and Sphere, and each party fully released the other party from any known or unknown and unsuspected claims. The Settlement
Agreement further provided that each party will bear its own costs in connection with the litigation.
