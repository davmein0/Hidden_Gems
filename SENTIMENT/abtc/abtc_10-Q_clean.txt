CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q (“Report”) contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act,
Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be preceded
by, or contain, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“plan,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “might,”
“could,” “would,” “should” or other words indicating future results, though not all forward-looking
statements necessarily contain these identifying words. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could
be deemed forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements about our future business operations and results, our
strategy and competition. These statements represent our current expectations or beliefs concerning various future events and involve
numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, including, but not limited to:

●

our need to, and difficulty in, raising additional capital;

●

any failure to close the Mergers;

●

the anticipated benefits of the Mergers not being realized when expected or at all;

●

the vision, goals, and trajectory of the Combined Company not being timely achieved or realized or achieved or realized at all;

●

the integration of Gryphon and ABTC being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected;

●

the Mergers being more expensive or taking longer to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events;

●

the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities due to the Mergers

●

the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Gryphon as a result of the Mergers; 

●
downturns in the Cryptocurrency
industry;

●
inflation;

●
increased interest rates;

●
the inability to procure needed
hardware;

●
the failure or breakdown of
mining equipment, or internet connection failure;

ii

●
access to reliable and reasonably
priced electricity sources;

●
cyber-security threats;

●
our ability to obtain and maintain
proper insurance;

●
construction risks;

●
banks and other financial institutions
ceasing to provide services to our industry;

●
changes to the Bitcoin network’s
protocols and software;

●
a decrease in the incentive
to mine Bitcoin;

●
an increase of transaction fees
related to digital assets;

●
the fraud or security failures
of large digital asset exchanges;

●
future digital asset, technological
and digital currency development;

●
our ability to maintain compliance
with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”);

●
trade restrictions and tariffs;

●
the regulation and taxation
of digital assets like Bitcoin; and

●
the other risks and uncertainties
discussed under the section titled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 39 of this Report and our other filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance,
or achievements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events
discussed or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus may not occur.

You should read this Report
with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking
statements in the foregoing documents by these cautionary statements.

Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc.

Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements

For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Nature of Operations

Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc.
(“Gryphon”), which originally began operations as Ivy Crypto, Inc., was incorporated under the provisions and by the virtue
of the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware on October 22, 2020, with its office located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Gryphon operates a digital asset (commonly referred to as cryptocurrency) mining operation using specialized computers equipped with application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) chips (known as “miners”) to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain
(in a process known as “solving a block”) in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards (primarily Bitcoin). Gryphon became a publicly
held entity in February 2024 upon the completion of a reverse merger transaction (the “Merger”) with Akerna Corp., herein
referred to as we, us, our, the Company or Akerna. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including
disclosures for certain activities up to and including the February 9, 2024 (the “Effective Date”) the date of the Merger,
are exclusively attributable to the operations of Ivy Crypto, Inc. The common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”) is
traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “GRYP” after February 9, 2024.

The legacy Akerna (“Legacy
Akerna’) was formed upon completion of the mergers between MTech Acquisition Corp. (“MTech”) and MJ Freeway, LLC (“MJF”)
on June 17, 2019 as contemplated by the Merger Agreement dated October 10, 2018, as amended (the “Formation Mergers”). Akerna
provided software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions within the cannabis industry that enabled regulatory compliance and inventory
management through several wholly-owned subsidiaries including MJF, Trellis Solutions, Inc. (“Trellis”), Ample Organics, Inc.
(“Ample”), Last Call Analytics (“LCA”), solo sciences, inc. (“Solo”), Viridian Sciences, Inc. (“Viridian”),
and The NAY People, Inc. d.b.a. 365 Cannabis (“365 Cannabis”). Our common stock, $
0.0001
 par value (“Common Stock”)
was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “KERN” through February 9, 2024.

Prior to the merger date
of February 9, 2024, Legacy Akerna committed to a number of significant actions that collectively represented a strategic shift in its
business strategy and a complete exit from the Saas business serving the cannabis industry. The shift was effectuated in a two-part exit
strategy whereby Legacy Akerna management (i) disposed of its component Saas business units in advance of (ii) the Merger with Gryphon,
an entity unaffiliated with the Saas and cannabis industries.

Reverse Merger with Legacy Ivy Crypto, Inc.

On January 27, 2023, Akerna entered into an agreement
and plan of merger, as amended on April 28, 2023 and June 14, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”) with Ivy Crypto, Inc. (formerly
known as Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (“Ivy”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Gryphon Opco I LLC. On February 9, 2024, concurrent
with the closing of the Sale Transaction, Legacy Akerna merged with and into Ivy, with Ivy surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Akerna. Following the closing of the Merger, the former Ivy and Akerna stockholders immediately before the Merger owned approximately

92.5
 percent and 
7.5
 percent, respectively, of the outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis which effectively resulted in a
change in control of the Company. Upon completion of the Merger, Akerna changed its name to Gryphon.

On February 9, 2024, the Company completed the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Merger”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Akerna Merger Co.
(“Merger Sub”) merged with and into Ivy, with Ivy surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akerna. On the Effective Date
of the Merger, each share of Ivy’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “Ivy Common Stock”), and Ivy’s
preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “Ivy Preferred Stock,” collectively referred to herein with the Ivy Common
Stock as the “Ivy Shares”), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date was converted into the right to receive approximately

1.7273744
 shares of Gryphon common stock. Each warrant to purchase common stock of Ivy that was issued and outstanding at the Effective
Date remained issued and outstanding and were assumed by the Company and is exercisable for shares of common stock pursuant to its existing
terms and conditions as adjusted to reflect the ratio of exchange of Ivy Shares for shares of common stock. In connection with the Merger,
on February 8, 2024, Akerna filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Reverse
Stock Split Amendment”). Because the Reverse Stock Split Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock,
the effect of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance relative to the number
of shares issued and outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split did not modify any voting rights or other terms of the common stock. Eighty
thousand and eight hundred and sixty-four (
80,864
) fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Immediately
after giving effect to the Merger and the Reverse Stock Split, the Company had 
38,038,533
 shares of common stock outstanding. On February
9, 2024, the common stock began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “GRYP.” All share and per-share data presented in these
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted for the exchange ratio.

As contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, Akerna’s operations were sold concurrently with the closure of the merger, so the Company’s operations after the
Merger are those of lvy.

Ivy is treated as the accounting
acquirer in the Merger as its stockholders, board of directors, and management control the Company after the Merger, even though Akerna
was the legal acquirer. The Merger was treated as a reverse recapitalization of lvy effected by a share exchange for a financial account
and reporting purposes since all of Akerna’s operations were disposed of as part of the consummation of the Merger. Therefore, Ivy
recorded no goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of the merger. The Merger was treated as if Ivy issued 
2,921,362
 shares of
common stock for the $(
2,256,000
) net book value of Akerna. As a result, the assets, liabilities, and historical operations reflected
in these financial statements are those of lvy, as if lvy had always been the reporting company.

The Akerna net book value of approximately $(
2,256,000
)
consisted of $
500,000
 of cash, prepaid expense of approximately $
98,000
 and liabilities of approximately $
2,854,000
.

On April 20, 2022, Ivy formed
a limited liability company named Gryphon Opco I LLC (“GOI”). GOI aims to engage in any activity for which limited liability
companies may be organized in the State of Delaware.

On December 20, 2024, the
Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary Canada corporation named 2670786 Alberta LTD (“Alberta LTD”). Alberta LTD was formed
to be the holding company for the prospective acquisition of Captus Energy.

On May 6, 2025, the Company formed wholly owned subsidiaries GDM Merger
Sub Inc. and GDM Merger Sub II LLC to be used for the merger with ABTC.

ABTC Merger Agreement

On
May 9, 2025, the Company, GDM Merger Sub I Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of Gryphon (“Merger
Sub Inc.”), GDM Merger Sub II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned direct subsidiary of Gryphon (“Merger
Sub LLC”), and American Bitcoin Corp., a Delaware corporation (“ABTC”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the “ABTC Merger Agreement”). 

The ABTC Merger Agreement
provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement:

●
Merger Sub Inc. will merge
with and into ABTC, with ABTC surviving the merger (the “First Merger”) as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Gryphon (the
corporation surviving the First Merger, the “First Merger Surviving Corporation”); and

●
immediately after the First
Merger, the First Merger Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC surviving the merger (the
“Second Merger” and, taken together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”) as a wholly owned direct subsidiary
of the Company (the company surviving the Second Merger, the “Surviving Company”). The Company following the Mergers is referred
to herein as the “Combined Company.”

The ABTC Merger Agreement
provides that, prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Effective Time”), The Company will file a new
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “New Charter”) that, among other things, will (i) rename and
reclassify the Company’s existing common stock, into Class A common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “Gryphon
Class A Common Stock”), establish a new series of common stock designated as Class B common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share
(the “Gryphon Class B Common Stock”) and establish a new series of common stock designated as Class C common stock, par
value $
0.0001
 per share. Each share of Gryphon Class A Common Stock will be entitled to 
one
 vote per share, and each share of
Gryphon Class B Common Stock will be entitled to 
10,000
 votes per share.

At the First Effective Time:

●
each share of Class A common stock, par value $
0.0001
, of ABTC (“ABTC Class A Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Gryphon Class A Common Stock, equal to an exchange ratio calculated pursuant to the terms set forth in the ABTC Merger Agreement (the “Exchange Ratio”), as merger consideration in the First Merger (such shares in aggregate, the “Class A Merger Consideration”); and

●
each share of Class B common
stock, par value $
0.0001
, of ABTC (“ABTC Class B Common Stock” issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Gryphon Class B Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, as merger
consideration in the First Merger, (such shares in the aggregate, the “Class B Merger Consideration”, and together with the
Class A Merger Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”).

6

At the effective time of
the Second Merger (the “Second Effective Time”):

●
each share of common stock
of the First Merger Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will automatically be
canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

●
each equity interest of Merger
Sub LLC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will automatically be converted into and become one equity
interest of the Surviving Company; and

●
Gryphon will become the sole
member of the Surviving Company.

Following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the ABTC Merger Agreement, including the Mergers (the “Closing”), (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Gryphon Class A Common Stock and Gryphon Class B Common Stock issued to the former stockholders and other equity holders of ABTC as
Merger Consideration is expected to represent approximately 
98.0
% of the outstanding equity interests of the Combined Company and
(ii) Gryphon equity holders as of immediately prior to the First Merger are expected to own 
2.0
% of the outstanding equity interests
of the Combined Company after their shares of Gryphon Common Stock are reclassified into shares of Gryphon Class A Common Stock.
Following the Mergers, ABTC’s business will be the business of the Combined Company.

Certain reclassifications
have been made to the 2024 unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in order to conform to the current period presentations.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto are unaudited. The unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual
financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The December 31, 2024 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from
audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. The results for the six months ended June
30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025 or for any future period.

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for
the year ended December 31, 2024, included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 31, 2025.

Principles of Consolidation

The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Going Concern

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial
statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values.

Since the Company began revenue generation in
September 2021, management has financed the Company’s operations through equity and debt financing and the sale of the digital assets
earned through mining operations. On June 30, 2025, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $
678,000
 and digital assets totaling
$
917,000
.

The Company may incur additional
losses from operations and negative cash outflows from operations in the foreseeable future. In the event the Company continues to incur
losses, it may need to raise debt or equity financing to finance its operations until operations are cashflow positive. However, there
can be no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms, when and if needed, or at all.
The precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time and will depend on several factors, including
the market price for the underlying commodity mined by the Company and its ability to procure the required mining equipment and operate
profitably. The Company’s financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company’s future results are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”) group is composed of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company
operates as 
one
 operating segment and uses net income or loss as measures of profit or loss on a consolidated basis in making decisions
regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. Additionally, the Company’s CODM regularly reviews the Company’s
expenses on a consolidated basis. The financial metrics used by the CODM help make key operating decisions, such as determination of significant
acquisitions and allocation of budget between cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses.

Since the Company operates
as 
one
 reportable segment, all financial information required by “Segment Reporting” can be found in the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements. The CODM does not review segment assets at a level other than that presented in the Company’s
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. There are no intra-entity sales or transfers, and no significant expense categories regularly
provided to the CODM beyond those disclosed in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825-10”) which defines fair value
as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.

ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy
that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
ASC 825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Observable inputs
other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or
infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived
principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are
significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all
short-term highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates their fair value. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents
in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in accounts that at times may be in excess of the federally
insured limit of $
250,000
 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions. As
of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had $
379,000
 and $
1,081,000
 in excess of the federal insurance limit, respectively.
The Company has never suffered a loss due to such excess balances.

8

Prepaid Expenses

Prepaid expenses consist of payments for the Company’s
co-location services, an insurance policy and other professional services, and the amounts are expected to be realized and consumed within
twelve months after the reporting period.

Digital Assets

Digital assets or cryptocurrencies
(including Bitcoin, Ethereum, DAI, and USDT) are included in current assets in the accompanying balance sheets. Cryptocurrencies purchased
are recorded at cost and cryptocurrencies obtained by the Company through its sale of common stock are accounted for based on the value
of the specific digital asset on the date received.

Digital assets are included
in current assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability to sell bitcoin in a highly
liquid marketplace and the sale of bitcoin to fund operating expenses to support operations. The Company measures digital assets at fair
value with changes recognized in operating expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Mining Equipment

Mining equipment is stated
at cost, including purchase price and all shipping and customs fees, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally three years for cryptocurrency mining equipment.

The Company reviews the carrying
amounts of mining equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where it is
not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is
the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows to be derived
from continuing use of the asset or cash-generating unit are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Fair value less costs of disposal is the amount
obtainable from the sale of an asset or cash-generating unit in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties,
less the cost of disposal. When a binding sale agreement is not available, fair value less costs of disposal is estimated using a discounted
cash flow approach with inputs and assumptions consistent with those of a market participant. If the recoverable amount of an asset or
cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is reduced to its
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in net income.

At the point in time a miner
becomes inoperable and not repairable, the Company records an expense amounting to the carrying value, which is the cost basis less accumulated
depreciation at the time of write off.

Leases

The Company accounts for
its leases under ASC 842, 
Leases 
(“ASC 842”). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are
classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and a lease liability,
calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental
borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized
over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line
rent expense over the lease term.

In calculating the right-of-use
asset and the lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company excludes
short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

9

Derivatives

The Company evaluates all
of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair
value and would then be revalued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. If there
are stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company will use a probability-weighted average series Binomial lattice option pricing
models to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates.

The classification of derivative
instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting
period. Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash
settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Derivative liability will be measured
initially and subsequently at fair value.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue
under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:

●
Step 1: Identify the contract
with the customer

●
Step 2: Identify the performance
obligations in the contract

●
Step 3: Determine the transaction
price

●
Step 4: Allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract

●
Step 5: Recognize revenue when
the Company satisfies a performance obligation

In order to identify the
performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify
each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct”
good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or
service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable
of being distinct), and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other
promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).

If a good or service is not distinct, the good
or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a distinct bundle of goods or services is identified.

The transaction price is
the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.
The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction
price, an entity must consider the effects of all the following:

●
Variable consideration

●
Constraining estimates of variable
consideration

●
The existence of a significant
financing component in the contract

●
Noncash consideration

●
Consideration payable to a
customer

Variable consideration is
included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue
recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price
is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance
obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time, or over time as appropriate.

Cryptocurrency mining:

The Company entered into contracts with digital
asset mining pool operators to provide the service of performing hash computations for the mining pool operator. The contracts are continuously
renewable and are terminable without penalty at any time by either party. The Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins
when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled
to a fractional share of Bitcoin. Hashrate is the measure of the computational power per second used when mining. Since the contract is
continuously renewing, second by second, the mining contract is considered to have a duration of less than 24 hours for accounting purposes.

Providing computing power
in Bitcoin transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities. The provision of computing power
is the only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with third party pool operators. The transaction consideration the
Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which is all variable. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.

The Company earns Bitcoin
during a 24-hour cycle between 00:00:00 UTC and 23:59:59 UTC (“24-hour Period”) unless terminated in accordance with the terms
set forth by the terms of service. The Company performs hash computations for one mining pool operator, Foundry USA. Foundry USA operates
its pool on the Full Pay Per Share (FPPS) payout method. FPPS is a variant of the Pay Per Share (PPS) method, where miners receive a fixed
payout for each valid share submitted, regardless of whether the pool finds a block.

The fair value of the Bitcoin award received is
determined using the intraday average quoted price of the Bitcoin over the 24-Hour Period. The Company’s Bitcoin earned are actively
traded on the major trading platforms. The Company considers Coinbase to be its primary market. The consideration the Company will receive,
comprised of block rewards, transaction fees less mining pool operator fees are aggregated, over the 24-Hour Period, in a sub-balance
account held by the mining pool operator, which is finalized one hour later at 1:00 AM UTC. The sub-balance account is then withdrawn
to the Company’s whitelisted wallet address, once a day, between the hours of 9am to 5pm UTC time (the “Settlement”).
The rate of payment occurs once per day, as long as the minimum payout threshold of 
0.01
 bitcoin has accumulated in the sub- account balance,
in accordance with the mining pool operator’s terms of service. At the time of Settlement, the company values the amount of Bitcoin
earned. Given that the contract duration is considered less than 24 hours, the Company uses the average Bitcoin price over the 24-hour
period, as quoted by Coinbase, to record the revenue. By utilizing the average daily price of bitcoin over the time earned, the Company
eliminates any differences that may arise due to the volatility in trading price between bitcoin and fiat currency during the period where
the Company establishes and completes the contract.

Pursuant to ASC 606-10-55-42,
the Company assessed if the customer’s option to renew represented a material right that represents a separate performance obligation
and noted the renewal is not a material right. The definition of a material right is a promise in a contract to provide goods or services
to a customer at a price that is significantly lower than the stand-alone selling price of the good or service. The mining pool operator
does not provide any discounts and as such there is no economic benefit to the customer and as such a separate performance obligation
does not exist under 606-10-55-42. In addition, there are no options for renewal that are separately identifiable from other promises
in the contract, such as an ability to extend the contract at a reduced price.

The performance obligation
of the Bitcoin miner under the mining contracts with Foundry Pool USA involves the service of performing hash computations to facilitate
the verification of digital asset transactions. The Company’s miners contribute computing power (i.e. hashrate) that perform hash
calculations to the mining pool operator, engaging in the process of validating and securing transactions through the generation of Bitcoin
hashes. The mining pool then utilizes a specific mining algorithm (e.g. SHA-256) to submit shares (proof of work) to the mining pool’s
server as they contribute to solving the Bitcoin puzzles required to mine a block. The Company reviews and analyzes its individual pool
performance using a dashboard provided by Foundry Pool USA that includes real-time statistics on hashrate, shares submitted and earnings.
The service of performing hash computations in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary
activities. The provision of providing these services is the only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with mining
pool operators.

Regardless of the pool’s
success, the Company will receive consistent rewards based on the number of valid shares it contributes. The transaction consideration
the Company receives is non-cash consideration, in the form of bitcoin. The Company measures the bitcoin at fair value on the date earned
using the average price (calculated by averaging the daily open price and the daily close price) quoted by its Principal Market at the
date the Company completed the service of performing hash computations for the mining pool operator. There are no deferred revenues or
other liability obligations recorded by the Company since there are no payments in advance of the performance. At the end of each 24-hour
period (00:00:00 UTC and 23:59:59 UTC), there are no remaining performance obligations. By utilizing the average daily price of bitcoin
on the date earned, the Company eliminates any differences that may arise due to the volatility in trading price between bitcoin and fiat
currency during the period where the Company establishes and completes the contract. The consideration is all variable. There is no significant
financing component in these transactions.

If authoritative guidance
is enacted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the Company may be required to change its policies, which
could affect the Company’s financial position and results from operations.

11

Cost of Revenues

The Company’s cost of revenue consists primarily
of direct costs of earning bitcoin related to mining operations, including electric power costs, other utilities, labor, insurance whether
incurred directly from self-mining operations or reimbursed, including any revenue sharing arrangements under co-location agreements,
but excluding depreciation and amortization, which are separately stated in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations.

ASC 606-10-32-25 through 32-27
in the FASB ASC provides guidance on the consideration of whether fees paid to a mining pool operator should be considered payments to
a customer and treated as a reduction of the transaction price or revenue. The Company’s management reviewed the standards and completed
the following assessment.

Identifying the Customer:
ASC 606-10-32-25 states that an entity should determine whether the counterparty to a contract is a customer. If the counterparty is a
customer, the entity should apply the revenue recognition guidance to that contract. Under ASC 606-10-32-25, the Company identified the
mining pool operator as the customer as the Company entered into a contractual agreement with the pool operator whereas the Company is
to provide services in the form of contributing hashing power to the pool.

Mining Pool Operator as
a Customer: As the Company has determined the mining pool operator to be a customer, any fees paid to the mining pool operator would be
part of the transaction price of the contract. Any fees paid by the Company as a miner to the pool operator would be revenue earned by
the pool operator, and the pool operator is treated as the customer.

Transaction Price: ASC 606-10-32-26
provides guidance on determining the transaction price. The Company considered the effects of variable consideration, constraints on variable
consideration, the existence of a significant financing component in the contract, and non-cash consideration. The Company receives variable
consideration given the variable nature of the amount of mining power (hashrate) contributed on a daily basis (24-hour period per recurring
contract term). The Company completes an analytical procedure as part of its monthly closing process to determine the reasonableness of
consideration received. There are no significant financing components of the transaction or delays in the timing of payments from the
customer to the Company, whereas the Company would need to adjust the transaction price for the time value of money. As the Company receives
non-cash consideration, in the form of bitcoin, ASC 606-10-32-26 specifies that the Company should measure non-cash consideration at fair
value. The fair value of the non-cash consideration would be included in the determination of the transaction price. The Company does
not receive the gross amounts of bitcoin earned prior to the transaction fees deduction by the pool operator. As such, the consideration
received is net or inclusive of the transaction fees incurred and charged by the customer (pool operator).

Variable Consideration: If
the fees paid to the mining pool operator are variable, an entity should estimate the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.
This involves considering the likelihood and magnitude of a significant revenue reversal. ASC 606-10-32-26 emphasizes the need to assess
whether there are constraints on variable consideration. In the instance where there is uncertainty about the amount of consideration,
it is reasonable for the Company to consider a likelihood of a significant reversal of revenue. The Company reviews daily bitcoin rewards
received and reviews various factors, such as mining difficulty, the price of bitcoin and the Company’s contribution to the pool
operator. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration the Company should receive and prepares a monthly workpaper documenting
the difference in actual bitcoin rewards received vs. estimated bitcoin earned. The Company assessed, given the pool operators payout
methodology and the revenue reasonableness test completed by management, there does not exist a likelihood of a significant reversal of
revenue.

Reduction of Transaction Price:
ASC 606-10-32-27 states that an entity should reduce the transaction price for variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable
that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company assessed various factors,
identifying the variable consideration, estimating the variable consideration, considered constraints (although none existed such as performance
metrics or targets), probability, documentation, regular review and monitoring of performance with open communication with pool operators
combined with dashboard usage. Due to the Company utilizing Foundry Pool’s FPPS methodology and the previous mentioned factors,
there was zero likelihood of a significant reversal of revenue as the Company receives payouts as a pool participant on a daily basis
calculated from midnight-to-midnight UTC time, regardless of if the Pool Operator receives any block rewards.

In summary, fees paid to
the mining pool operator are considered payments to a customer and treated as a reduction of the transaction price/revenue. The Company
has carefully assessed the variable nature of these fees, considered the likelihood and magnitude of any potential adjustments, and documented
that management has applied the revenue recognition guidance accordingly.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for our stock-based
compensation under ASC 718 
“Compensation 
- 
Stock Compensation”
 using the fair value-based method. Under this
method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which
is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or
services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments, or the issuance of those equity instruments may settle
that.

We use the fair value method
for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value of options. The stock-based
fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement
date) and is recognized over the vesting periods.

Common stock awards

The Company has granted common stock awards to
non-employees in exchange for services provided. The Company measures the fair value of these awards using the fair value of the services
provided or the fair value of the awards granted, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value measurement date of these awards
is generally the date the performance of services is complete. The fair value of the awards is recognized on a straight-line basis as
services are rendered. The share-based payments related to common stock awards for the settlement of services provided by non-employees
are recorded in accordance with ASC 718 on the statement of operations in the same manner and charged to the same account as if such settlements
had been made in cash.

Warrants

In connection with certain
financing, consulting, and collaboration arrangements, the Company has issued warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. The outstanding
warrants are standalone instruments that are not puttable or mandatorily redeemable by the holder and are classified as equity awards.
The Company measures the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the measurement date. Warrants issued
in conjunction with the issuance of common stock are initially recorded at fair value as a reduction in additional paid-in capital of
the common stock issued. All other warrants are recorded at fair value as expense over the requisite service period or at the date of
issuance if there is not a service period.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for
income taxes under the asset and liability method, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years 
in 
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment
date. A valuation allowance is required to the extent any deferred tax assets may not be realizable.

ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes,
(“ASC 740”), also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Based on the Company’s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant
uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s financial statements. The Company believes that its income tax positions
and deductions would be sustained at the audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in material changes to its financial
position.

Earnings Per Share

The Company uses ASC 260, “Earnings Per
Share” for calculating the basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. The Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share by
dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed
based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and warrants and stock
awards. For periods with a net loss, basic and diluted loss per share is the same, in that any potential common stock equivalents would
have the effect of being anti-dilutive in the computation of net loss per share.

Securities that could potentially dilute loss
per share in the future were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents, consisting of unvested RSUs and warrants, amounted to 
10,445,063

shares and 
588,626
 shares as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company’s management reviewed all recently
issued accounting standard updates (“ASU’s”) not yet adopted by the Company and does not believe the future adoptions
of any such ASU’s may be expected to cause a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial condition
or the results of its operations, except for the following.

In October 2023, the FASB
issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification
Initiative. The amendments in this Update modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the Codification.
Certain of the amendments represent clarifications to, or technical corrections of the current requirements. Each amendment in the ASU
will only become effective if the SEC removes the related disclosure or presentation requirement from its existing regulations by June
30, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the provisions of the ASU will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. The amendments in this ASU are not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial
position.

On December 14, 2023, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09
requires entities to disclose specific rate reconciliations, amount of income taxes separated by federal and individual jurisdiction,
and the amount of income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) disaggregated between federal, state, and
foreign. The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.

In November 2024, the FASB
issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)”.
The amendments require the disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses including purchases of inventory, employee
compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil and
gas producing activities. It also requires the disclosure of a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions
that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively as well as the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods,
an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the provisions
of the ASU will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption

with the terms of the Captus Agreement. In November 2024, the Company paid a cash deposit of $
143,759
 (CAD $
200,000
) to Captus GP for
the benefit of the Vendors (the “LOI Cash Deposit”). Within two business days of the date of the Captus Agreement, the Company
paid a cash deposit of$
704,641
 (CAD $
1,000,000
) to Captus GP for the benefit of the Vendors (the “Signing Cash Deposit,” and

Each of the Restricted Stock
Awards vests in three equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date subject to the grantee’s continued engagement
with the Company through each applicable vesting date, provided however, that the Restricted Stock Awards will accelerate and vest immediately
upon the grantee’s death, disability, termination by the Company without “cause” (as defined in each Restricted Stock
Award agreement), or the consummation of a change in control of the Company.

On May 29, 2025 (“Assignment
Date’), the Company entered into an Assignment and Amending Agreement (“Assignment Agreement”) with Captus Energy and
2703444 Alberta LTD (“Assignee”). Captus Energy consented to the Company’s assignment of its rights and interests in
the Captus agreement to the Assignee, which agreed to the assumption of the rights and interest in the Captus agreement for $
1.00
. As

Erikson National Energy Inc.

On December 9, 2024, the Company entered into
an asset purchase and sale agreement (the “Erikson Purchase Agreement”) with Erikson National Energy Inc. (“Erikson”),
a Canadian corporation under the laws of the Province of Alberta. Erikson commenced proposal proceedings under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency
Act (Canada) (“BIA”) on October 1, 2024 by filing a Notice of Intention to Make a Proposal, pursuant to section 50.4 of the
BIA, and KSV Restructuring Inc. was named as proposal trustee. Pursuant to an order of the Court of King’s Bench of Alberta (the
“Court”) granted on October 21, 2024, the Court approved a sale and investment solicitation process (“SISP”) in
respect of the sale of the assets and properties of Erikson. As part of the SISP, the Company and Erikson entered into the Court-approved
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase substantially all of Erikson’s assets for a purchase price of
CAD $
2,000,000
, subject to certain adjustments as provided for in the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Erikson Purchase Agreement,
the Company will acquire all of Erikson’s natural gas and oil wells, facilities and pipelines, which are currently shut in. The
assets are located in northeast British Columbia and span the Fort St. John, Stoddart, Roseland, Fireweed, Buick Creek, Laprise and Wildboy
areas. The representations and warranties provided by the parties are standard for a transaction of this nature.

The transaction remains subject
to certain conditions, which conditions include obtaining the mineral rights formerly held by Erikson, obtaining approval for the well,
facility and pipeline license transfers from the British Columbia Energy Regulator, completion of Gryphon’s due diligence, and the
granting of a sale approval and vesting order by the Court, all of which must be satisfied or waived by the Company by January 31, 2025,
which date may be extended at the Company’s option to March 8, 2025 (in either case, the “Outside Date”). No assurance
can be given that the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement will close.

The Court also granted an
amended interim financing order approving the Company as a debtor in possession (“DIP”) lender to Erikson. As part of the
Erikson Purchase Agreement, the Company provided DIP interim financing to Erikson to cover its operating expenses and legal and professional
fees during the period between December 9, 2024 and the applicable Outside Date. Upon closing, The Company may offset some or all of the
interim financing provided against the purchase price. On February 14, 2025, the Company gave Erikson notice of the cancellation of the
Erikson Purchase Agreement, and expensed approximately $
608,000
 of deposits classified under the Merger and acquisition expenses in the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations

The terms of the Note Payable include the following:

The outstanding principal and

●
One-time payment of in the

●
The Lender may convert half
of the outstanding principal at a price of $

stock (for purposes of classifying the Restructured Loan, it was concluded that the conversion option did not meet the requirements to
be bifurcated and classified as a derivative, nor was there a large premium paid that would be classified as an addition to paid-in capital
so the conversion option is included in the value of the host instrument).

●
The Note Payable cannot be
converted or exercised if the Lender and its affiliates would beneficially own more than 
19.99
% of the number of shares of common stock
as of the date of the agreement after giving effect to such conversion or exercise without the approval of the Company’s stockholders,
for which the Company is required to seek such approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders.

NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments

Board Member Compensation

On October 31, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
the director’s compensation program, as follows:

Element

Annual equity award

$
160,000

Annual board cash retainer

$

Annual Audit Committee Member Retainer

$

20,000

Annual Compensation Chair Additional retainer

$
15,000

Annual Nominating/Governance Chair Additional retainer

$
15,000

The cash retainers will be paid monthly in arrears.

The annual equity award will be in the form of
restricted stock units (“RSUs”). The number of RSUs to be granted shall be determined by dividing the dollar amounts stated
above by the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s common stock over the forty-five (
45
) trading days
immediately preceding (but not including) the Grant Date, rounded to the nearest whole RSU.

Subject to each grantee’s
continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting date, the awards made hereunder shall vest as to one-fourth (1/4) of
the RSUs subject to each award (rounded down to the nearest whole share) upon the first four (4) quarterly anniversaries dates.

Employment Agreements

CEO Agreements

On September 30, 2024, the
grant date, the Company’s board of directors approved the issuance of the RSUs, pursuant to the CEO Agreement. The Company relied
on guidance set by FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-07 (issued and updated on October 2021) related to Compensation - Stock Compensation
(“Topic 718”) to determine the impact on the Company. The grant date fair value for the 
1,114,454
 Time-based RSUs was estimated
to be approximately $
735,000
 based on the Company’s closing price of $
0.66
 as of the grant date. The Company will recognize expense
on a straight-line basis over the service period starting October 1, 2024. The remaining 
557,228
 Market-based RSUs were considered to
have a market-based vesting as the milestones are based on the Company’s remediation of certain stock exchange listing qualifications,
which are based on the market price and market capitalization of the Company’s common stock. As further required by Topic 718, a
market-based award’s fair value is required to be expensed over the derived service period whether the milestone is met or not.
The Company hired a third-party valuation firm to calculate the fair value of the Market-based Awards. The fair value of approximately
$
312,000
 was determined by the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation model (i) over the period from September 30, 2024 through August 31, 2025
(the estimated date to achieve the remediation of the Nasdaq deficiencies over the period set forth in the CEO Agreement), (ii) a risk-free
rate of 
4.0
%, (iii) volatility of 
152.0
%, (iv) a starting price of $
0.68
, (v) a price hurdle $
1.00
 and (vi) a time hurdle of 
10
 days,
for a derived fair value of $
0.56
 per share and a derived service period of approximately 
0.33
 years. The $
312,000
 value of Market-based
awards was expensed during the fourth quarter of 2024.

19

The CEO Agreement also provides
Mr. Gutterman with the opportunity to earn an incentive bonus (the “Incentive Bonus”), with will become payable, if ever,
in tranches following the Company’s attainment of certain stock price and market capitalization goals. The specific goals are as
follows:

No Incentive Bonus tranche will become payable
unless both the stock price goal and the market capitalization goal (“Goals’) for the applicable tranche are satisfied, and
the market capitalization goal is attained simultaneously with the stock price goal. Additionally, the Incentive Bonus may be earned in
a change in control if the consideration paid per share of Company common stock exceeds an Incentive Bonus tranche stock price goal and
the total value received in the transaction exceeds an Incentive Bonus tranche market capitalization goal. Under no circumstances may
the performance goals for an Incentive Bonus tranche be achieved more than one time. The Incentive Bonus, to the extent any tranche becomes
payable, will be paid within thirty days of the attainment of the applicable goals, subject to Mr. Gutterman remaining in continuous employment
with the Company through each payment date. The Company will continue to evaluate the probability of the CEO’s achievement of the
Goals. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had not accrued for the Incentive Bonus.

All bonuses payable under the CEO Agreement, except
the stock bonus, may be paid in cash, Bitcoin, Company equity, or a mix of any of the foregoing.

Under the CEO Agreement, Mr. Gutterman will be
entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits upon a termination of his employment by the Company without “cause”,
by Mr. Gutterman for “good reason” (each, as defined in the CEO Agreement and collectively, a “Qualifying Termination”),
that does not occur in connection with a change in control:

(1)
the Accrued Obligations (as
defined in the CEO Agreement),

(2)
Mr. Gutterman’s annual
base salary, and

(3)
the product of (x) 12 and (y)
Mr. Gutterman’s monthly cost for health and welfare benefits pursuant to his elections under the Company’s health and welfare
benefit plans, as in effect on the termination date (collectively, the “Non-CIC Severance”)

The Non-CIC Severance will
be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the effective date of a release but no later than 74 days following Mr. Gutterman’s
termination. If Mr. Gutterman incurs a Qualifying Termination within thirty (30) days prior to or twelve (12) months following a change
in control, then in addition to the Non-CIC Severance, Mr. Gutterman will be entitled to the following:

(4)
An amount equal to 0.5 times
Mr. Gutterman’s target bonus and

(5)
acceleration and vesting on
a prorated basis (performance goals will be assumed to have been achieved at target) of each outstanding equity award held by Mr. Gutterman
as of the termination date (but excluding the Incentive Bonus) (collectively, the “CIC Severance”).

To the extent payable in cash, the CIC Severance
will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable following the effective date of a release, but no later than 74 days after Mr. Gutterman
’s termination date. The severance payments and benefits described above are subject to Mr. Gutterman ’s execution and non-revocation
of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and continued compliance with his restrictive covenant obligations.

The CEO Agreement includes
certain restrictive covenants, which include non-solicitation and non-competition covenants during the term of the CEO Agreement and for
the twelve (12) months following. Further, the CEO Agreement includes a “best pay” provision under Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code, pursuant to which any “parachute payments” that become payable to Mr. Gutterman will either be paid in full
or reduced so that such payments are not subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever results
in the better after-tax treatment to Mr. Gutterman.

Blockfusion Co-location Mining Services Agreement

On December 1, 2024, the
Company entered into an agreement with Blockfusion USA, Inc. (“Blockfusion”) to provide hosting services for 
3,780
 of the
Company’s bitcoin miners not to exceed 12MW of allocated power (“Blockfusion MSA”) for a period of twelve months (November
30, 2025), automatically renewing for one month extensions until terminated by either party, (“Term”). The Company is required
to pay to Blockfusion a monthly facility fee of $
13,000
 per MW, for an aggregate of $
156,000
 (“Facility Fee”) for standard
levels of maintenance of the Company’s Mining Equipment, including fault diagnosis and software upgrades, and racking and unracking
of faulty machines. The Company’s monthly power usage will charge to the Company without a Blockfusion markup charge. At the signing
of the Blockfusion MSA, the Company was required to pay (i) an initial monthly Facility Fee of $
156,000
 to be applied to the December
2024 Facility fee, (ii) a deposit in the aggregate of $
600,000
, as follows $
200,000
 on December 6, 2024, $
200,000
 on January 1, 2025 and
$
200,000
 on February 1, 2025 (“Cash Deposit”) and (iii) the Company is required, prior to January 27. 2025, and thereafter
at all times during the Term, maintain an irrevocable letter of credit, or prior to January 31, 2025 maintain a cash deposit and thereafter
at all times during the Term, in the amount of $
1,200,000
 (“LOC Deposit”). As of the release date of these unaudited condensed
consolidated Financial Statements, the Cash Deposit has been paid and is not outstanding while the LOC Deposit remains outstanding.

The Company determined that the agreement with
Blockfusion does not meet the definition of a lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases.

On April 15, 2025, due to high industry hash
rates and high energy costs, Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (the “Company”) and Blockfusion USA, Inc. (“Blockfusion”)
agreed to suspend mining operations and curtail service, respectively.

Mawson Agreement

On January 3, 2025, Gryphon
entered into a Master Co-Location Agreement (the “Mawson Agreement”) with Mawson Hosting LLC (“Mawson”) with a
right to host up to 
5,880
 miners in Mawson’s facility in Midland, Pennsylvania. Pursuant to the Mawson Agreement, the Company is
entitled to 20 MW of power at a cost of approximately $
23.50
 per MW/hour paid monthly with a minimum fee of approximately $
165,521
 per
month, as well as certain other fees set forth in the agreement. The Mawson Agreement has an initial term of one year and may be terminated
on sixty days’ notice. During the first quarter of 2025, the Company delivered 
6,719
 bitcoin miners to Mawson.

The Company determined that the agreement with
Mawson does not meet the definition of a lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases.

Sphere 3D MSA

On August 19, 2021, Gryphon entered into a Master
Services Agreement (the “Sphere MSA”) with Sphere 3D. The Sphere 3D MSA has a term of three years, beginning on August 19,
2021, and terminating on August 18, 2024, with one-year automatic renewal terms thereafter. Under the Sphere MSA, Gryphon is Sphere 3D’s
exclusive provider of management services for all blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations, including but not limited to services
relating to all mining equipment owned, purchased, leased, operated, or otherwise controlled by Sphere 3D and/or its subsidiaries and/or
its affiliates at any location, with Gryphon receiving a percentage of the net operating profit of all of Sphere 3D’s blockchain
and cryptocurrency-related operations.

On December 29, 2021, the
Company and Sphere 3D entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Sphere 3D MSA, to provide greater certainty as to the term of the Sphere 3D
MSA. Sphere 3D and Gryphon agreed to extend the initial term of the Sphere 3D MSA from three to four years, or to five years in the event
Sphere 3D does not receive delivery of a specified minimum number of Bitcoin mining machines during 2022.

On April 7, 2023, Sphere 3D filed a suit against
Gryphon in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit concerns the Sphere MSA between the parties where the Company agreed to act
as Sphere 3D’s “exclusive provider of any and all management services for all blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations.”
Sphere 3D alleges that the Company has fallen short in its obligations under the Sphere MSA, and is suing for alleged breach of contract,
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty (such matter, the “Sphere 3D Litigation”).

On October 6, 2023, Sphere 3D delivered a termination
notice to the Company with respect to the Sphere MSA, largely on the basis of the allegations made by Sphere 3D in the Sphere 3D Litigation
(the “Sphere 3D MSA Termination”). On October 11, 2023, the Company filed an answer to Sphere 3D’s second amended complaint,
in which, among other things, the Company alleged that Sphere 3D’s attempted termination of the Sphere MSA was wrongful and ineffective,
because it violated the terms of the Sphere MSA, and thus that Sphere 3D continues to owe the Company all amounts to which it would otherwise
be entitled under the Sphere MSA through that contract’s term ending in August 2026.

21

On March 7, 2025, The Company and Sphere 3D entered
into a settlement and release agreement on mutually acceptable terms. The Settlement Agreement fully resolved all pending litigation between
the Company and Sphere, and each party fully released the other party from any known or unknown and unsuspected claims. As of March 7,
2025, the Company had a liability of due to Sphere 3D of approximately $
449,000
, which was written off and recorded as a gain on settlement
of accounts payable in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Contingencies

The Company is subject at
times to various claims, lawsuits, and governmental proceedings relating to the Company’s business and transactions arising in the
ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict the final outcome of such proceedings. Where appropriate, the Company vigorously
defends such claims, lawsuits, and proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and proceedings seek damages, including, consequential,
exemplary, or punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. Certain of the claims, lawsuits, and proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of business are covered by the Company’s insurance program. The Company maintains the property and various
types of liability insurance in an effort to protect the Company from such claims. In terms of any matters where there is no insurance
coverage available to the Company, or where coverage is available and the Company maintains a retention or deductible associated with
such insurance, the Company may establish an accrual for such loss, retention, or deductible based on currently available information.
In accordance with accounting guidance, if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date
of the financial statements, and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable, then an accrual for the cost to resolve or settle these claims
is recorded by the Company in the accompanying balance sheets. If it is reasonably possible that an asset may be impaired as of the date
of the financial statement, then the Company discloses the range of possible loss. Expenses related to the defense of such claims are
recorded by the Company as incurred and included in the accompanying statements of operations. Management, with the assistance of outside
counsel, may, from time to time adjust such accruals according to new developments in the matter, court rulings, or changes in the strategy
affecting the Company’s defense of such matters. On the basis of current information, the Company does not believe there is a reasonable
possibility that other than with regard to the Class Action described below, any material loss, if any, will result from any claims, lawsuits,
and proceedings to which the Company is subject to either individually, or in the aggregate.

On September 5, 2024 and September
13, 2024, the Company received deficiency notices from Nasdaq, who have certain stock exchange listing qualification requirements, such
as the Company to maintain a stock price of at least $
1.00
 and maintain MVLS of at least $
35,000,000
 (the “Deficiencies”).
The Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 4, 2025 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. Also,
the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 12, 2025, to regain compliance with the $
35,000,000
 MVLS Requirement. On
June 6, 2025, the NASDAQ notified that the Company regained compliance with listing rules for both the minimum bid price and market value.

4
)-year period beginning

with the following schedule. The equity award was valued as of the grant date at $
0.477
 per share for a total of $
239,000
. The grant date
fair value was estimated to be fair value of the Company’s common stock on the Grant Date. The equity compensation expense for the
six months ended June 30, 2025 amounted to approximately $
61,000
.

As of the resolution date
October 31, 2024, with an effective date of October 1, 2024, there were seven board members entitled to the annual equity award of $
160,000

 (as further disclose in NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES).
As of October 1, 2024, the grant date, a total of 
1,914,580
 shares of the Company’s common stock, based on a VWAP of $
0.61
 per share.
The fair value of the shares as of the grant date was $

3.36
 per
share for a total of$

GRYP). The equity compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2025 amounted to approximately $
24,000

three anniversaries of the grant date subject to the grantee’s continued engagement with the Company through each applicable vesting
date, provided however, that the Restricted Stock Awards will accelerate and vest immediately upon the grantee’s death, disability,
termination by the Company without “cause” (as defined in each Restricted Stock Award agreement), or the consummation of a
change in control of the Company. The equity awards were valued as of the grant date at $
0.452
 per share for a total of $
1,846,000
. The
grant date fair value was estimated to be fair value of the Company’s common stock on the Grant Date. Upon the execution of the
Captus Assignment Agreement, the Restricted Stock Awards were cancelled and returned to the Company. For the Restricted Stock Awards,
the Company recorded compensation expense of approximately $
436,000
. Since the vesting periods did not occur, as of the Cancelation Date,
the compensation expense of $
436,000
 was reversed and classified as stock-based compensation expense.

Anchorage warrant

In October 2024, the Company issued, to Anchorage,
a warrant to purchase 
2,000,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock at $
1.50
 per share (“Anchorage Warrant”). Concerning
the ABTC Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to amend the Anchorage Warrant by lowering the strike price from $
1.50
 to $
0.55
. The Anchorage
Warrant was accounted for as an equity instrument when issued with the Anchorage Note Payable debt restructuring; therefore, the modification
will be accounted for pursuant to ASC 718-20-35-3 for awards classified as equity. The Anchorage Warrant’s fair value immediately
before the modification was calculated to be approximately $
696,000
 and the modified Anchorage Warrant’s fair value was calculated to
be approximately $
824,000
, for a $
128,000
 increase in the fair value. Since the Anchorage Warrant was originally accounted for as an equity
instrument the $
128,000
 increase in fair value was expensed and classified as ABTC merger expense. In June 2025, Anchorage elected to
cashless exercise both the Penny Warrants and the Anchorage Warrants. The Company issued a total of 
4,384,470
 shares of the Company’s
common stock for $
0
 cash.

Business Overview

Founded in October 2020, Gryphon
has traditionally been a bitcoin mining company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gryphon launched its mining operations in September 2021 upon
the receipt of the first of 12 batches of 600 Bitmain S19j Pro Antminers. Gryphon’s current revenue model is to mine and hold bitcoin,
and then sell only the bitcoin that is necessary to pay its operating expenses and to reinvest in operational expansion. The bitcoin that
is sold to pay operating expenses and to reinvest in operational expansion is typically sold within 24-hours of receipt.

Gryphon operates approximately
5,880 bitcoin ASIC mining computers, referred to as “miners,” from Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”) that
Gryphon has installed at a third-party hosted mining data center located in Pennsylvania. Revenue generated by the mining of bitcoin is
measured on a dollar per megawatt-hour (“MWh”) basis and is variable based on the price of Bitcoin, the measure of difficulty,
transaction volume and global hash rates. See “Recent Developments – Blockfusion Agreement” below.

For the six months ended June
30, 2025 and 2024, Gryphon mined approximately 31 and 226 bitcoins, respectively. While Gryphon does not have any plans to acquire digital
assets other than bitcoin, it may do so in the future.

Breakeven Analysis

Breakeven of Total Bitcoin mined

$
117,636

$
38,291

The
breakeven analysis is computed by taking the cost of revenues for the given period and dividing that sum by the number of Bitcoin mined
during the same period. For instance, for the six months ended June 30, 2025 the $3,662,000 cost of revenues is divided by the 31 Bitcoin
mined, resulting in an average of $117,636 per coin. The breakeven analysis is an operational metric that does not take capital expenditures
or financing mechanics into consideration. The calculation only considers direct operational costs, such as electricity and hosting. The
mining equipment was originally financed primarily through equity capital raises and cash flows resulting from the sale of bitcoin generating
by mining operations. As of June 30, 2025, there were no financing agreements outstanding related to financing of mining equipment.

The
breakeven analysis is a non-GAAP measure, similar to the way the gold industry reports gold-equivalent ounces to provide uniform measure
of various revenue streams from different commodities (such as gold, copper, nickel, etc.). Much like the gold industry, the purpose of
this calculation is to offer the reader a bitcoin-equivalent datapoint for Gryphon’s primary revenue stream. This enables readers
to easily compare Gryphon’s operations with other bitcoin mining companies. By dividing the total cost of revenues by the number
of bitcoin mined, one arrives at the breakeven point. Therefore, if Gryphon sells a bitcoin at the same price, it would have achieved
a breakeven.

27

The
breakeven cost of mining bitcoin is influenced primarily by two factors. First, the cost of electricity sourced from Gryphon’s hosting
providers, which encompasses a combination of pass-through market electricity prices and profit-sharing arrangements. Second, it is affected
by the global hashrate of the Bitcoin network. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the cost of electricity has fluctuated due to
increased demand year over year from $0.0736 per kilowatt hour during the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $0.0926 per kilowatt hour
during the six months ended June 30, 2025, reaching a high of $0.1223 per kilowatt hour during January 2025. In addition, the global hashrate
of the Bitcoin network has shown a consistent upward trend, with sequential increases of 4.4%, 16.9%, 9.2% and 9.1% over the last four
quarters ending June 30, 2025. This increase in the global hashrate has led to fewer bitcoins being mined for the same amount of energy
consumption. The combined effect of these changes in the two key cost drivers has resulted in an increase in the overall breakeven level
as of June 30, 2025 compared to June 30, 2024.

Recent Developments

ABTC Merger Agreement

See “Explanatory Note”
and “Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies “ABTC Merger” to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2025 included in this Report.

Blockfusion Agreement

On December 1, 2024, the Company
entered into an agreement with Blockfusion USA, Inc. (“Blockfusion”) to provide hosting services for 3,780 of the Company’s
bitcoin miners not to exceed 12MW of allocated power (“Blockfusion MSA”) for a period of twelve months (November 30, 2025),
automatically renewing for one month extensions until terminated by either party, (“Term”). The Company was required to pay
to Blockfusion a monthly facility fee of $13,000 per MW, for an aggregate of $156,000 (“Facility Fee”) for standard levels
of maintenance of the Company’s Mining Equipment, including fault diagnosis and software upgrades, and racking and unracking of
faulty machines. The Company’s monthly power usage would charge to the Company without a Blockfusion markup charge. At the signing
of the Blockfusion MSA, the Company was required to pay (i) an initial monthly Facility Fee of $156,000 to be applied to the December
2024 Facility fee, (ii) a deposit in the aggregate of $600,000, as follows: $200,000 on December 6, 2024, $200,000 on January 1, 2025
and $200,000 on February 1, 2025 (“Cash Deposit”) and (iii) the Company was required, prior to January 27. 2025, and thereafter
at all times during the Term, maintain an irrevocable letter of credit, or prior to January 31, 2025 maintain a cash deposit and thereafter
at all times during the Term, in the amount of $1,200,000 (“LOC Deposit”). As of the release date of these consolidated Financial
Statements, the Cash Deposit has been paid and is not outstanding while the LOC Deposit remains outstanding.

On April 15, 2025, due to
high industry hash rates and high energy costs, Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (the “Company”) and Blockfusion USA, Inc. (“Blockfusion”)
agreed to suspend mining operations and curtail service, respectively.

Captus Energy

On January 8, 2025, the Company
and Alberta Ltd., entered into a Share and Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Captus Agreement”) with BTG Energy Corp., a Canadian
corporation (“BTG Energy”), BTG Power Corp., a Canadian corporation (“BTG Power”) and West Lake Energy Corp.,
a Canadian corporation (“West Lake,” and together with BTG Energy and BTG Power, the “Vendors”). Pursuant to the
Captus Agreement, the Company was to acquire from the Vendors all of the issued and outstanding shares or units, as applicable, of (i)
Captus Generation Ltd. (“Captus GP”) and BowArk Energy Ltd., each a Canadian corporation, and (ii) Captus General Limited
Partnership, a Canadian limited partnership (collectively “Captus Energy,” and the transaction contemplated by the Captus
Agreement, the “Captus Acquisition”).

In connection with the Captus
Agreement, on January 8, 2025, as a material inducement to their agreeing to become employees of the Company, the Company granted a restricted
stock award to each of Harry Andersen, Paul Connolly, Mark Taylor and Steve Giacomin (collectively, the “Restricted Stock Awards”).
The Restricted Stock Awards were intended to constitute “employment inducement awards” under the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules.
The aggregate restricted stock shares issued was 4,083,003.

On May 29, 2025, the Company
entered into an Assignment and Amending Agreement (“Assignment Agreement”) with Captus Energy and 2703444 Alberta LTD (“Assignee”).
Captus Energy consented to the Company’s assignment of its rights and interests in the Captus agreement to the Assignee, which agreed
to the assumption of the rights and interest in the Captus agreement for $1.00. As of the Assignment date, the Company wrote off the Captus
Acquisition cost of approximately $1,292,000 classified as the merger and acquisition expenses in accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
statement of operations. In addition, the Restricted Stock Awards were cancelled and returned to the Company.

Mining revenues

Mining
revenues decreased to $2,935,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025 from $13,005,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease
in mining revenues of $10,070,000 was due to a combination of factors. The average value of bitcoin mined for the six months ended June
30, 2025 was $94,000 compared to $58,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $36,000, or 63.0%. For the six months
ended June 30, 2025, the Company had approximately 10,700 miners in operation compared to approximately 8,800 for the six months ended
June 30, 2024. However, these increases in revenue recognized per bitcoin earned and operational miners were offset by the increase in
global hashrate as well as the 50% reduction in block rewards due to the halving event in April 2024.

During
the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the average daily global hashrate was 875.7 exahash and 602.1 exahash, respectively, an increase
of 45%.

Cost of revenues

Cost
of revenues decreased to $3,662,000 for the six months ended June 30 2025, from $8,640,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The
decrease of $4,978,000 was primarily due to the decrease in the number of Bitcoin mined offset by (i) an increase in Bitcoin network hashrate
and (ii) higher energy costs.

Professional
fees decreased to $1,562,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, from $1,939,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease
of $377,000 relates to (i) a $205,000 decrease in legal related fees, (ii) a $98,000 decrease in accounting related fees, and (iii) a
$74,000 decrease in other professional fees.

Investor
and public relations expenses decreased to $1,046,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, from $3,354,000 for the six months ended
June 30, 2024. Given the pending merger with ABTC, management has suspended the use of third-party consultants for investor and public
relations services.

Salaries
and wages increased to $1,264,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, from $454,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase
of $810,000 is due (i) $419,000 for 2025 bonus accruals for our executive officers, (ii) $216,000 increase in compensation related to
our CEO and VP of Energy, both hired during Q4 of 2024, (iii) $70,000 increase in employee benefits, and (iv) $105,000 increase in compensation
for our directors.

Other
expenses increased to $364,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, from $105,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase
of $259,000 was due to an increase of $290,000 for repair work on our miner fleet, offset by a general decrease in other expenses of approximately
$30,000.

29

Stock-based compensation
expense

Stock-based
compensation expense increased to $811,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, from $348,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
The increase is due to the issuance of restricted stock units to our CEO, VP of Energy and members of the Board of Directors during the
fourth quarter of 2024.

Depreciation expense

Depreciation
decreased to $1,586,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, from $6,539,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease is
due to the average remaining useful life of the mining fleet as of June 30, 2025 was 23 months, while the average remaining
useful life of the mining fleet as of June 30, 2024 was 52 months.

Unrealized gain on
digital assets

For
the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company incurred an unrealized gain on digital assets of $74,000 as compared to an unrealized
gain of $1,385,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The fair market value of a Bitcoin as of December 31, 2024 was approximately
$93,000 as compared to approximately $107,000 as of June 30, 2025. The increase of approximately $14,000 and the number of Bitcoin held
by us (approximately 9 as of June 30, 2025) resulted in the unrealized gain for the six months ended June 30, 2025. The fair market
value of a Bitcoin as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $43,000 as compared to approximately $62,000 as of June 30, 2024. The increase
of approximately $19,000 and the number of Bitcoin held by us (approximately 16 as of June 30, 2024) resulted in an unrealized gain for
the six months ended June 30, 2024.

For
the six months ended June 30, 2025, unrealized loss on marketable securities was $43,000, as compared to $272,000 for the six months ended
June 30, 2024. The loss for the six months ended June 30, 2025 related to a decrease in the fair market value of the underlying securities
held.

Gain on extinguishment
of accounts payable 

On March 7, 2025, the Company
and Sphere 3D entered into a settlement and release agreement on mutually acceptable terms. The Settlement Agreement fully resolved all
pending litigation between the Company and Sphere 3D, and each party fully released the other party from any known or unknown and unsuspected
claims. As such the Company was relieved of a $449,000 payable to Sphere 3D, which was expensed as of the settlement date.

Change in fair value
of BTC Note

During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had a note payable denominated in Bitcoin, which was accounted for under the fair value
method of accounting. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a $6,895,000 increase in the fair value of notes
payable. The note payable was settled in October 2024; therefore, the Company did not incur a fair value change for the six months ended
June 30, 2025.

Merger and acquisition costs

For
the six months ended June 30, 2025 merger and acquisition cost increased to $3,164,000 compared to $394,000 for June 30, 2024. During
the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company terminated the Giga Purchase Agreement and the Erikson Purchase Agreement. For the Giga
Purchase Agreement, the Company had approximately $350,000 of cash deposits. For the Erikson Purchase Agreement, the Company had $447,000
of cash deposits and $161,000 of professional fees. The cash deposits and related professional fees were expensed as of each of the acquisition
termination dates.

As
of the Captus Assignment Agreement, the Company had approximately $1,953,000 of cash deposits and related professional fees, which were
expensed as of the assignment date.

Also, the Company had approximately $223,000 of fees related to three
other potential acquisitions. The $253,000 was expensed upon the termination dates of the contracts.

Loss on disposal of
asset

Loss
on disposal of asset was $83,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, as compared to $146,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
The loss related to the April 2025 disposal of 66 miners with a cost basis of approximately $132,000 and accumulated depreciation of approximately
$49,000.

ABTC merger costs

On
May 9, 2025, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with ABTC. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company
incurred approximately $989,000 of costs related to the ABTC merger, consisting of $543,000 for legal fees, $103,000 for accounting
services, $200,000 for fairness opinion, $128,000 for the modification of the Anchorage warrant, and $15,000 of other miscellaneous
expenses.

Interest expense

For
the six months ended June 30, 2025, interest expense was $9,000 as compared to $620,000 for June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June
30, 2024 interest expense was related to the note payable denominated in Bitcoin. As to the Bitcoin denominated note payable was settled
in October 2024 and accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring, the new note payable principal balance was increased for aggregate
interest expense accrued under the prior note, and as such the monthly interest payment reduces the note payable balance; therefore, the
Company did not recognize interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2025.

Three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended

Mining revenues

Mining
revenues decreased to $1,377,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025 from $5,515,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The
decrease in mining revenues of $4,138,000 was due to a combination of factors. The average value of bitcoin mined for the three months
ended June 30, 2025 was $98,000 compared to $66,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $32,000, or 49.0%. For the
three months ended June 30, 2025, the Company had approximately 10,600 miners in operation compared to approximately 8,800 as of June
30, 2024. However, these increases in revenue recognized per bitcoin earned and operational miners were offset by the increase in global
hashrate as well as the 50% reduction in block rewards due to the halving event in April 2024.

During
the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the average daily global hashrate was 875.7 exahash and 602.1 exahash, respectively, an
increase of 45%.

Cost of revenues

Cost
of revenues decreased to $1,608,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $3,803,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024.
The decrease of $2,195,000 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of Bitcoin mined offset by (i) an increase in Bitcoin network
hashrate and (ii) higher energy costs.

Professional
fees decreased to $419,000 for the three months ended June 30 2025, from $891,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease
of $472,000 relates to (i) a $552,000 decrease in legal fees, (ii) a $34,000 decrease in accounting fees, and (iii) a $114,000 increase
in other fees.

Investor
and public relations expenses decreased to $313,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $2,467,000 for the three months ended
June 30, 2024. Given the pending merger with ABTC, management has suspended the use of third-party consultants for investor and public
relations services.

Salaries
and wages increased to $618,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $221,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The
increase of $397,000 was due (i) $209,000 for bonus accruals for our executive officers, (ii) a $108,000 increase in compensation related
to our CEO and VP of Energy, both hired during Q4 of 2024, (iii) a $23,000 increase in employee benefits, and (iv) a $57,000 increase
in compensation for our directors.

Stock-based compensation
expense

Stock-based
compensation expense decreased to $39,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $140,000 for the three months ended June 30,
2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2025 our stock based compensation expense was $287,000, which was offset by a $248,000 reversal
for the 2025 first quarter expense for the Captus Energy restricted stock awards, which were canceled during the second quarter of 2025,
due to the Captus Energy Assignment Agreement.

Depreciation expense

Depreciation
decreased to $515,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, from $3,292,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease
is due to the fact that average remaining useful life of the mining fleet as of June 30, 2025 was 23 months, while average remaining useful
life of the mining fleet as of June 30, 2024 was 52 months.

Unrealized loss (gain)
on digital assets

For
the three months ended June 30, 2025 the Company incurred an unrealized gain on digital assets of $200,000 as compared to an unrealized
loss of $318,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The fair market value of Bitcoin as of March 31, 2025 was approximately $83,000
as compared to approximately $107,000 as of June 30, 2025. The increase of approximately $24,000 and the number of Bitcoin held (approximately
9 as of June 30, 2025) resulted in the unrealized gain for the three months ended June 30, 2025. The fair market value of a Bitcoin
as of April 30, 2023 was approximately $71,000 as compared to approximately $62,000 as of June 30, 2024. The decrease of approximately
$9,000 and the number of Bitcoin held by us (approximately 16 as of June 30, 2024) resulted in an unrealized loss for the three months
ended June 30, 2024.

Unrealized gain (loss)
on marketable securities

For
the three months ended June 30, 2025 unrealized gain on marketable securities was $23,000, as compared to an unrealized loss of $56,000
for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The gain for the three months ended June 30, 2025 related to an increase in the fair market
value of the underlying securities held.

Change in fair value
of BTC Note

During
the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had a note payable denominated in Bitcoin, which was accounted for under the fair value
method of accounting. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a $2,743,000 increase in the fair value of notes
payable. The note payable was settled in October 2024; therefore, the Company did not incur a fair value change for the three months ended
June 30, 2025.

Merger and acquisition costs

As
of the date of the Captus Assignment Agreement, the Company had approximately $1,953,000 of cash deposits and related professional
fees, which were expensed as of the assignment date.

Loss
on disposal of asset

Loss
on disposal of assets was $83,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025, as compared to $146,000 for the three months ended June 30,
2024. The loss related to the April 2025 disposal of 66 miners with a cost basis of approximately $132,000 and accumulated depreciation
of approximately $49,000.

ABTC Merger costs

On
May 9, 2025, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with ABTC. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company incurred
approximately $989,000 of costs related to the ABTC merger, consisting of $543,000 for legal fees, $103,000 for accounting services, $200,000
for fairness opinion, $128,000 for the modification of the Anchorage warrant, and $15,000 of other miscellaneous expenses.

Interest expense

Interest
expense of $290,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was related to the note payable denominated in Bitcoin. As to the Bitcoin
denominated note payable was settled in October 2024 and accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring, the new note payable principal
balance was increased for aggregate interest expense accrued under the prior note, and as such the monthly interest payment reduces the
note payable balance; therefore, the Company did not recognize interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2025.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As
of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $678,000 and $735,000, respectively, and an accumulated
deficit of approximately $79,272,000 and $67,735,000, respectively. The Company financed its operations primarily through proceeds from
the sales of its equity securities through private placements, its at-the-market program as described below, borrowings pursuant to the
Sphere 3D Note and the BTC Note and cash flow from its digital currency mining operations.

The
Company believes that its current levels of cash will not be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for its operations for at least
the next 12 months. The Company will require additional capital resources to fund its operations and pay its obligations as they come
due over the next twelve months. The Company may also need to implement a strategy to expand its business or other investments or acquisitions.
The Company may sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into a credit facility to satisfy its capital requirements. The sale
of additional equity securities could result in dilution to its shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased
debt service obligations and could require the Company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict its operations.
Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company if at all. Any failure by the Company to raise additional
funds on terms favorable to it, or at all, could limit its ability to expand its business operations and could harm its overall business
prospects.

On
June 10, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement for the offering, issuance and sale of up to a maximum aggregate offering price
of $70.0 million of common stock that may be issued and sold under an at-the-market issuance sales agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann &
Co. Inc., Kingswood Investments, a division of Kingswood Capital Partners, LLC, PI Financial (US ) Corp. and ATB Capital Markets USA Inc.,
each respectively acting as sales agents (the “ATM”). The Company has used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds
from the ATM for general corporate purposes, including without limitation, repurchases and redemptions of our common stock and general
working capital. The ATM will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the issuance and sale of all of the shares of the common stock subject
to the conditions set forth in the ATM or (ii) termination of the ATM as otherwise permitted thereunder. The ATM may be terminated at
any time by either the Company or any sales agent with respect to itself upon five days’ prior notice, or by the sales agents at
any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse effect on us. As of June 30, 2025, approximately $62.036
million in capacity remains under the ATM.

Note Payable

On
May 25, 2022, Anchorage entered into an Equipment Loan and Security Agreement (as amended on March 27, 2023) with Gryphon Opco I LLC,
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which Anchorage loaned Gryphon Opco the principal amount of 933.333333
bitcoin. Gryphon Opco’s obligations under the Anchorage Loan Agreement were secured by certain equipment and software rights of
Gryphon Opco and were guaranteed by Gryphon.

On
October 25, 2024, Gryphon, its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as applicable, and Anchorage entered into the Debt Repayment and Exchange
Agreement; Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement, Form of Pre-Funded Warrant and Form of $1.50 Warrant to restructure the Anchorage Loan
and terminate the existing the Anchorage Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the New Anchorage Agreements, (i) approximately $9.1 million of the
Anchorage Loan was converted into shares of Common Stock, at an ascribed value of $1.10 per share, resulting in the issuance of 8,287,984
shares of Common Stock to Anchorage in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, (ii) approximately $3.9
million of the Anchorage Loan was converted into warrants to purchase 3,530,198 shares of Common Stock, which warrants are exercisable
immediately, have an unlimited term and an exercise price of $0.01 per share, in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act and (iii) the remaining $5 million of the Anchorage Loan was exchanged for a new $5 million loan pursuant to the New Loan
Agreement.

Pursuant
to the New Loan Agreement:

●

the outstanding principal and interest are denominated in dollars;

●

the interest rate is 4.25% payable monthly;

●

Anchorage has been given a first priority lien on all of Gryphon and its subsidiaries’ assets;

●

covenants related to mining machine locations and covenant ratios in the Anchorage Loan Agreement have been removed; and

●

Anchorage may convert half of the outstanding principal at a price of $1.10 per share of Common Stock and the remaining half at a price of $1.50 per share of Common Stock.

The
New Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Gryphon, customary conditions to closing, indemnification
obligations of the Company and the purchasers, including for liabilities arising under the Securities Act, other obligations of the parties
and termination provisions. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Loan Agreement were made only for the purposes
of such agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreements, and may be subject to limitations
agreed upon by the contracting parties.

Pursuant
to the New Anchorage Agreements, Gryphon also issued Anchorage warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock, which warrants are
exercisable immediately, will expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The $1.50 Warrants
were issued in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

The
Restructured Loan and the Anchorage Warrants cannot be converted or exercised, respectively, if Anchorage (together with its affiliates)
would beneficially own in excess of 19.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the date of the New Anchorage Agreements
after giving effect to such conversion or exercise without the approval of Gryphon’s stockholders. Gryphon has agreed to seek such
approval at its next annual meeting of stockholders.

On
May 10, 2025, Gryphon entered into a warrant amendment with Anchorage to amend the $1.50 Warrants. Pursuant to the Amendment, Gryphon
reduced the exercise price of the $1.50 Warrants from $1.50 to $0.55 per share and, subject to the closing of the Mergers, will remove
Section 15 of the $1.50 Warrants, which provides most favored nation rights.

All
of the Anchorage Warrants have been exercised and none remain outstanding.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

35

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs
and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our
financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates
are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable after taking into account our circumstances
and expectations for the future based on available information. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.

We consider an accounting
estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the
time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use
of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined
above.

The critical accounting policies,
and the judgements, estimates, and assumptions associated with such policies, that we believe have the greatest potential impact on the
consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

From time to time, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards-setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the
FASB ASC are communicated through the issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”). The Company considers the applicability
and impact of all ASUs on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Described
below are ASUs that are not yet effective but may be applicable to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash
flows, or presentation thereof. As of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, there were no ASUs that management assessed
and determined to be applicable to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to the Company’s
results determined in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance
under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Company provides investors with reconciliations from net loss
to adjusted EBITDA as components of Management’s Discussion and Analysis. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as (a) GAAP net income
(loss) plus (b) adjustments to add back the impacts of (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) interest expense, (3) income tax expense
(benefit) and (4) adjustments for non-cash and non-recurring items which currently include (i) stock compensation expense, (ii) change
in fair value of notes payable (iii) gain on restructuring of bitcoin denominated note payable and (iv) unrealized (gain) loss on marketable
equity securities.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial
measure of performance under GAAP and, as a result, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements
prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction
with the Company’s Interim Reports on Form 10-Q and its Annual Reports on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management uses adjusted EBITDA and the supplemental information provided herein as a means of understanding, managing, and evaluating
business performance and to help inform operating decision making. The Company relies primarily on its consolidated financial statements
to understand, manage, and evaluate its financial performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.

Recently Adopted Pronouncements

On
December 13, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Topic 350-60): Accounting for and
Disclosure of Crypto Assets. ASU 2023-08 requires entities to measure crypto assets that meet specific criteria at fair value with changes
recognized in net income each reporting period. Additionally, ASU 2023-08 requires an entity to present crypto assets measured at fair
value separately from other intangible assets in the balance sheets and record changes from remeasurement of crypto assets separately
from changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets in the income statement. The new standard is effective for the Company
for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2024. The
adoption of the ASU 2023-08 was a $740,000 increase of our digital assets, as of January 1, 2024.

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (ASC Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.”
The amendments require the disclosure of significant segment expenses as well as expanded interim disclosures, along with other changes
to segment disclosure requirements. The standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2024. We have implemented the provisions of the ASU 2023-07. See Note 1.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period
covered by this Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our “Certifying Officers”) conducted evaluations
of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the term “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures
of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures.

37

Based on their evaluation,
the Certifying Officers concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

The material weakness related
to internal control over financial reporting that was identified at June 30, 2025 was that we did not have sufficient personnel staffing
in our accounting and financial reporting department. As a result, we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties and were
not able to provide for adequate review of the financial statements.

This control deficiency could
result in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. However, our management believes that the material weakness identified does not result in the restatement of any previously reported
financial statements or any other related financial disclosure, and management does not believe that the material weakness had any effect
on the accuracy of our financial statements included as part of this Report.

We will continue to monitor
and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing
basis and are committed to taking action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. Management
has commenced the following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on an ongoing basis:

●
Continue the process that was
started during 2024 of adding to the Company’s internal resources to enhance its capabilities in the areas of technical accounting,
financial reporting, and internal controls, that may include hiring a full-time person dedicated to internal controls.

●
Utilize external third-party
audit and SOX 404 implementation firms to enable the Company to improve the Company’s controls related to its material weaknesses.

●
Continue to evaluate existing
processes and implement new processes and controls where necessary in connection with remediating the Company’s material weaknesses,
such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively.

The Company recognizes that
the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls
operate for a sufficient period of time and can be tested and concluded by management to be designed and operating effectively. Because
the Company’s remediation efforts are ongoing, it cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful
or that its internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts.

The Company continues to evaluate
and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting related to the identified material weaknesses, and management may determine
to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify the remediation plan described above. In addition,
the Company will report the progress and status of the above remediation efforts to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

During the most recently completed
fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - Other Information

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.

PPP Loan

On April 21, 2020, the Company
obtained a loan in the principal aggregate amount of $2.2 million (the “PPP Loan”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program
under the CARES Act, which was forgiven in full, by the SBA, on September 3, 2021.

On February 5, 2024, the Company
received a letter, dated January 25, 2024, from the SBA, on behalf of Key Bank, in which the SBA indicated that, notwithstanding its prior
notification of forgiveness, in full, of repayment of the PPP Loan, it was reviewing its prior determination of forgiveness for potential
reversal. Specifically, the SBA indicated that based on its preliminary findings, the SBA is considering a full denial of the previously
received forgiven amount based on the purported ineligibility of the Company to have received the PPP Loan under the SBA loan programs
because the Company, operating as Akerna at the time of the PPP Loan, provided software support to the cannabis industry. The Company
responded to the SBA on February 6, 2024, providing reasons as to why it believes it was eligible for the PPP Loan, but has not received
any further correspondence from the SBA, since that date, and the SBA has not made any financial demands. The Company plans to continue
to cooperate with any further inquiry from the SBA.

In January 2024, the Company
received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking information and documents about the PPP Loan. The Company is cooperating with
the inquiry. At this time, there has been no formal demand for return of the PPP Loan proceeds, and no formal claim or lawsuit has been
initiated against the Company.

Former CEO Litigation

As previously disclosed, on
September 17, 2024, Robby Chang was terminated as Chief Executive Officer and President of Gryphon for cause, with immediate effect, by
the Gryphon Board. Mr. Chang remains a member of the Gryphon Board.

On October 21, 2024, the Company
received notice that both it and Ivy Crypto, Inc., a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company, have been named as defendants in a
complaint filed by Mr. Chang in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada, alleging wrongful termination. The Company intends to
defend this matter vigorously.

On October 22, 2024, the Gryphon
Board created a special committee to oversee the Company’s handling of the claim made by Mr. Chang, which is currently comprised
of Steve Gutterman, Jimmy Vaiopoulos and Jessica Billingsley. The Company and Ivy Crypto, Inc. have served their Statement of Defense,
and the parties agreed to proceed with a mediation of the dispute that was held on May 5, 2025. The mediation was unsuccessful, and the
litigation remains unresolved. The potential outcome cannot be determined at this time.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Except for the additional
risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes to our Risk Factors as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2025, as amended.

Neither Gryphon nor ABTC can be sure if
or when the Mergers will be completed.

The consummation of the
Mergers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions. Neither Gryphon nor ABTC can guarantee that the closing
conditions set forth in the ABTC Merger Agreement will be satisfied. If Gryphon is unable to satisfy the closing conditions in
ABTC’s favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, ABTC will not be obligated to complete the Mergers.
Under certain circumstances, Gryphon would be required to pay ABTC a termination fee of $5,000,000, in addition to the out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of ABTC in connection with the transactions contemplated by the ABTC Merger
Agreement.

If the Mergers are not completed, the Gryphon
Board, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to Gryphon stockholders, will evaluate other strategic alternatives or financing options
that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to Gryphon stockholders as the Mergers, if available at all. Any future
sale, merger, financing or other transaction may be subject to further stockholder approval. Gryphon may also be unable to find, evaluate
or complete other strategic alternatives, which may have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, financial condition or
results of operations.

39

Gryphon’s and ABTC’s efforts to complete
the Mergers could cause substantial disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding, their respective businesses, which may materially
adversely affect their results of operation and businesses. Uncertainty as to whether the Mergers will be completed may also affect Gryphon’s
and ABTC’s ability to retain and motivate existing employees. A substantial amount of Gryphon’s and ABTC’s management’s
and employees’ attention is being directed toward the Closing and thus is being diverted from their respective day-to-day operations.
Uncertainty as to Gryphon’s and ABTC’s future could adversely affect their relationship with collaborators, suppliers, vendors,
regulators and other business partners and stakeholders. For example, vendors, collaborators and other counterparties may defer decisions
concerning working with Gryphon or ABTC or seek to change existing business relationships with Gryphon or ABTC, during the pendency of
the Mergers. Changes to or termination of, existing business relationships could adversely affect Gryphon’s results of operations
and financial condition, as well as the market price of Gryphon Common Stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the Mergers could
be exacerbated by any delays in the Closing or by the termination of the ABTC Merger Agreement.

The Closing is subject to approval by the
Gryphon stockholders and the ABTC stockholders. Failure to obtain these approvals would prevent the Closing.

The Closing is subject to certain approvals by
the Gryphon stockholders and the ABTC stockholders. Failure to obtain the required stockholder approvals may result in a material delay
in or the abandonment of, the Mergers. Any delay in completing the Mergers may materially adversely affect the timing and benefits that
are expected to be achieved from the Mergers.

Gryphon stockholders will experience significant
ownership and voting power dilution in connection with the Mergers and may not realize a benefit from the Mergers commensurate with that
dilution.

Pursuant to the terms of
the ABTC Merger Agreement and upon the Closing, the Gryphon stockholders as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time are
expected to own 2.0% of the Combined Company Common Stock and the ABTC stockholders as of immediately prior to the First Effective
Time are expected to own 98.0% of the Combined Company Common Stock, each on a fully diluted basis. ABTC stockholders who hold ABTC
Class B Common Stock, including ABH, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hut 8, and certain other stockholders of ABTC, will
receive Class B Common Stock, which will entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes per share. The Class A Common Stock that will be
held by other stockholders of the Combined Company, including stockholders of Gryphon, will entitle the holder thereof to one vote
per share. While the actual Exchange Ratio will be determined at the Closing, it is currently expected that ABTC stockholders as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time will collectively represent approximately 99.99% and holders of equity interests of
Gryphon as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time will collectively represent less than 0.01% of the total combined voting
power of Combined Company capital stock, respectively, at the Closing. In addition, it is currently expected that at the Closing, on
the same basis, Hut 8 will own approximately 64.37% of the then-outstanding Combined Company Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis,
which is expected to represent approximately 80.00% of the total combined voting power of the Combined Company capital stock.

Accordingly, the issuance of Combined Company
Common Stock to ABTC stockholders in the Mergers will significantly reduce the ownership stake and relative voting power of each share
of Gryphon Common Stock held by current Gryphon stockholders. Consequently, following the Mergers, the ability of current Gryphon stockholders
to influence Combined Company management will be substantially reduced.

If the Combined Company is unable to realize the
strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Mergers, Gryphon stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution
of their ownership interests in Gryphon without receiving the expected commensurate benefit or only receiving part of the commensurate
benefit to the extent the Combined Company is able to realize only part of the expected strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated
from the Mergers.

40

The intended benefits of the Mergers may
not be realized.

The Mergers pose risks for Gryphon’s and
ABTC’s ongoing operations, including, among others:

●
that senior management’s attention may be diverted from
management of the respective businesses, current operations and development;

●
that there are significant costs and expenses associated with
any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and

●
that unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating Gryphon’s
and ABTC’s businesses in the Combined Company.

As a result of the foregoing and other factors,
risks and characteristics, the Combined Company may be unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated
from the Mergers and Gryphon and ABTC cannot assure you that the Mergers will be accretive to Gryphon or ABTC stockholders in the near
term or at all. Furthermore, if Gryphon or ABTC stockholders fail to realize the intended benefits of the Mergers or they take longer
than expected to achieve, the market price of the Combined Company’s common stock could decline to the extent that the market price
reflects those anticipated benefits. Gryphon stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in Gryphon
without receiving any commensurate benefit or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the Combined Company is able
to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Mergers.

Failure to complete the Mergers may result
in Gryphon paying a termination fee to ABTC, which could significantly harm the price of the Gryphon Common Stock and Gryphon’s
future business and operations.

If the Mergers are not
completed and the ABTC Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Gryphon may be required to pay ABTC a termination
fee of $5,000,000, in addition to the out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of ABTC in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the ABTC Merger Agreement. Even if such a termination fee is not payable in connection with a
termination of the ABTC Merger Agreement, Gryphon will have incurred significant fees and expenses, which must be paid whether or
not the Mergers are completed. Further, if the Mergers are not completed, it could significantly harm the market price of the
Gryphon Common Stock.

In addition, if the ABTC Merger Agreement is terminated and Gryphon
determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that Gryphon will be able to find a partner and close an alternative
transaction on terms that are as favorable as or more favorable to Gryphon than the terms set forth in the ABTC Merger Agreement or at
all.

The Mergers are subject to the requirements
of the HSR Act, and regulatory authorities may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Gryphon and/or ABTC following the
Mergers or that could delay, prevent or increase the costs associated with completion of the Mergers.

Completion of the Mergers is conditioned upon the expiration or termination
of any waiting period under the provisions of the HSR Act. Under the ABTC Merger Agreement, Gryphon and ABTC have agreed to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations
from governmental authorities and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with governmental authorities, that are necessary
to consummate the Mergers. However, there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to completing
the Mergers will be satisfied. In addition, the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions
on the Closing or require changes to the terms of the ABTC Merger Agreement or other agreements to be entered into in connection with
the ABTC Merger Agreement which may delay completion of the Mergers or impose additional material costs on or materially limit the revenues
of the Combined Company following the completion of the Mergers. There can be no assurance that regulators will choose not to impose such
conditions or changes in terms, and, if imposed, such conditions or changes in terms may delay or lead to the abandonment of the Mergers.

41

The Mergers may be completed even though
certain events occur prior to the Closing that materially and adversely affect Gryphon or ABTC.

The ABTC Merger Agreement provides that either Gryphon or ABTC can
refuse to complete the Mergers if there is a material adverse effect with the other party occurring between the date of the ABTC Merger
Agreement and the Closing. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Mergers, even if such
change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Gryphon or ABTC, including, but not limited to:

●
any changes in conditions generally affecting United States
or global economic, business, regulatory conditions, including changes in United States or global securities, credit, financial, debt
or other capital markets;

●
conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the currency,
Bitcoin mining, cryptocurrency, electricity, power or natural gas industry (including changes in cryptocurrency prices, commodity prices,
general market prices and regulatory changes affecting the industry);

●
general changes in national or international political conditions
(including the imposition of or changes in international tariffs, sanctions, trade policies or disputes or any “trade war”
and any cessation, outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any acts of war or terrorism or any other national or international calamity,
crisis or emergency);

●
acts of God, natural disasters, calamities, disease outbreaks
or pandemics;

●
any failure, in and of itself, by ABTC or any of its subsidiaries
to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial
or operating metrics for any period;

●
the execution and delivery of the ABTC Merger Agreement, the public
announcement thereof, the pendency of the ABTC Merger Agreement, the impact thereof on the relationships of ABTC and its subsidiaries,
with customers, suppliers or partners or the Closing;

●
any changes after the date of the ABTC Merger Agreement not announced
prior to the date of the Merger Agreement in any applicable law or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“
U.S. GAAP
”),
including, in each case, the authoritative interpretation or enforcement thereof;

●
any action required by a governmental authority pursuant to
antitrust laws in connection with the Mergers; and

●
any action or omission taken by ABTC pursuant to the prior written
request of Gryphon, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the ABTC Merger Agreement.

Certain officers and directors of Gryphon
have interests in the Mergers that may be different from or in addition to, the interests of Gryphon stockholders generally.

Some of Gryphon’s directors and officers
have interests in the Mergers that are different from Gryphon’s stockholders generally and that may influence them to support or
approve the Mergers without regard to the interests of Gryphon’s other stockholders. For example:

●
based on the terms of his employment agreement, Steve Gutterman,
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, will be entitled to receive a total value of approximately $2,290,794 in connection with
the Closing, which consists of (i) $737,164 as part of severance payments under his employment agreement and (ii) approximately $1,553,630
in value associated with the accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested restricted stock units;

●
based on the terms of his employment agreement, Simeon Salzman,
the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, will be entitled to receive a total value of approximately $412,500 in connection with the
Closing, which consists of a severance payment under his employment agreement that is payable in twelve equal monthly installments;

●
based on the terms of his employment agreement, Eric Gallie,
the Company’s Senior Vice President, Energy, will be entitled to receive a total value of approximately $835,000 in connection
with the Closing, which consists of (i) $250,000 as part of severance payments under his employment agreement, payable in twelve equal
monthly installments and (ii) approximately $585,000 in value associated with the accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested restricted
stock units; and

●
Gryphon’s directors and officers will be eligible for continued
indemnification and continued coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance after the Mergers and pursuant to
the terms of the ABTC Merger Agreement.

The Gryphon Board was aware of these interests
and considered them, among other matters, in the decision to approve the ABTC Merger Agreement.

42

Certain provisions of the ABTC Merger
Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to
the arrangements contemplated by the ABTC Merger Agreement.

The ABTC Merger
Agreement contains “no-shop” restrictions on Gryphon’s ability to solicit, initiate, endorse, knowingly encourage
or facilitate third party proposals relating to alternative transactions or to provide information to or engage in discussions with,
a third party in relation to an alternative transaction, subject to certain exceptions to permit the Gryphon Board to comply with
its fiduciary duties. The ABTC Merger Agreement also contains “force the vote” provisions that require Gryphon to hold
the Special Meeting even if the Gryphon Board withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation regarding the Proposals. Before the
Gryphon Board may change its recommendation to stockholders to vote in favor of the Proposals, Gryphon must, among other things,
provide ABTC with notice and negotiation rights. Upon the termination of the ABTC Merger Agreement in certain circumstances,
including in connection with a Gryphon Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, Gryphon may be required to pay up
to $5,000,000 as a termination fee, in addition to the out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of ABTC in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the ABTC Merger Agreement.

These provisions could discourage a potential
third party acquiror from considering or proposing an acquisition transaction, even if it were prepared to pay a higher price than what
would be received in the Mergers. These provisions might also result in a potential third party acquiror proposing to pay a lower price
than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $5,000,000 termination fee and additional ABTC fees and
expenses that may become payable.

If the ABTC Merger Agreement is terminated and Gryphon determines to
seek another business combination, Gryphon may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to or better
than, the terms of the ABTC Merger Agreement or at all.

Furthermore, as noted above, certain Gryphon securityholders holding
an aggregate of approximately 19.29% of the outstanding voting securities of Gryphon as of May 9, 2025 have entered into support agreements.
These Gryphon securityholders also agreed to vote against any Gryphon Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the ABTC Merger Agreement) or
any other proposal with respect to Gryphon that is in opposition to or in competition with, the Mergers. As a result, the support agreements
may discourage other parties from attempting to engage in a transaction with Gryphon, even if those parties would otherwise be willing
to offer greater value to Gryphon stockholders than that offered by ABTC under the Mergers.

Gryphon will be subject to certain contractual
restrictions while the Mergers are pending
.

The ABTC Merger Agreement restricts Gryphon from making certain acquisitions
and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, repurchasing or,
with respect to Gryphon, issuing equity securities outside certain limited exceptions and taking other specified actions until the earlier
of the Closing or the termination of the ABTC Merger Agreement without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent
Gryphon from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the Closing and could have the effect of delaying or preventing
other strategic transactions. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the Mergers could be exacerbated by any delays in the Closing
or the termination of the ABTC Merger Agreement.

The market price of Gryphon Common Stock
may decline and the value of ABTC’s securities may be adversely affected as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Mergers
.

The market price of Gryphon Common Stock may decline
and the value of ABTC’s securities may be adversely affected as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Mergers for a number
of reasons, including if:

●
investors react negatively to the prospects of the Combined
Company’s business and financial condition following the Mergers; and/or

●
the attention of Gryphon or ABTC management is directed towards
the Closing and other transaction-related considerations and is diverted from the day-to-day business operations of Gryphon or ABTC,
as applicable and matters related to the Mergers require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to
other opportunities that might have been beneficial to Gryphon or ABTC, as applicable.

A decline in the market price of Gryphon Common
Stock or an adverse effect upon the value of ABTC’s securities could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the financial condition,
results of operations or business prospects of, Gryphon, ABTC or the Combined Company.

43

If the Mergers are not completed, the Gryphon
Board may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of Gryphon. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to
its stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for
commitments and contingent liabilities.

There can be no assurance that the Mergers will
be completed. If the Mergers are not completed, the Gryphon Board may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of Gryphon. In such
an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to Gryphon stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision, as
with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution is expected to be reduced as Gryphon continues to fund its operations
and transaction-related expenses. In addition, if the Gryphon Board were to approve and recommend and Gryphon stockholders were to approve,
a dissolution and liquidation of Gryphon, Gryphon would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay its outstanding obligations, as
well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to Gryphon
stockholders. As a result of this requirement, a portion of Gryphon’s remaining cash assets may need to be reserved pending the
resolution of such obligations. In addition, Gryphon may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation.
If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, the Gryphon Board, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters
and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of Gryphon Common Stock could lose all or a significant
portion of their investment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Gryphon.

Litigation relating to the Mergers could
require Gryphon to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction and could delay or enjoin the Mergers.

Gryphon could be subject to demands or litigation
related to the Mergers, whether or not the Mergers are consummated. Such actions may create uncertainty relating to the Mergers or delay
or enjoin the Mergers and responding to such demands is often expensive and could divert management time and resources. In addition, such
demands or litigation could lead to a dissolution or bankruptcy of Gryphon if the costs associated with such demands or litigation are
significant enough.

Gryphon and ABTC are expected to incur substantial
expenses related to the Mergers.

Gryphon and ABTC have incurred and expect to continue
to incur, substantial fees and expenses in connection with the Mergers, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other transaction
fees and costs associated with the Mergers. Additionally, as the controlling stockholder of ABTC, Hut 8 has incurred and expects to continue
to incur fees and expenses in connection with the Mergers, and such costs are expected to be borne by ABTC.

As of June 25, 2025, ABTC has incurred approximately
$4.3 million of fees and expenses related to the Mergers, primarily consisting of legal, audit and accounting fees, and anticipates incurring
approximately $0.9 million of additional fees and expenses prior to the Closing. As of June 25, 2025, Gryphon has incurred approximately
$0.9 million of fees and expenses related to the Mergers, primarily consisting of legal, audit and accounting fees, and anticipates incurring
approximately $1.1 million of additional fees and expenses prior to the Closing. Actual transaction costs may substantially exceed Gryphon’s
and ABTC’s respective estimates and may have an adverse effect on the Combined Company’s financial condition and operating
results.

In addition, the Combined Company may also incur
significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems
consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Gryphon and ABTC continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated
costs may be incurred in the Mergers and the integration of the two companies’ businesses.

Gryphon or ABTC may waive one or more of
the Closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.

Gryphon or ABTC may determine to waive, in whole
or in part, one or more of the conditions to its obligations to consummate the Mergers. Gryphon and ABTC expect to evaluate the materiality
of any waiver and its effect on Gryphon or ABTC stockholders, as applicable, in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine
whether any amendment of the merger proxy statement/prospectus or any re-solicitation of proxies, approvals or voting cards is required
in light of such waiver. Any determination to waive any condition to the Mergers or as to re-soliciting stockholder approval or amending
the merger proxy statement/prospectus as a result of a waiver will be made by Gryphon or ABTC, as applicable, at the time of such waiver
based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time.

Following the completion of the Mergers,
the Combined Company may issue additional securities.

Following the completion of the Mergers, the Combined
Company may issue additional securities (including equity securities) to finance its activities. If the Combined Company were to issue
additional equity securities, the ownership interest of existing Gryphon and ABTC stockholders may be diluted and some or all of the Combined
Company’s financial measures on a per share basis could be reduced. Moreover, as the Combined Company’s intention to issue
additional equity securities becomes publicly known, the Combined Company’s share price may be materially adversely affected.
