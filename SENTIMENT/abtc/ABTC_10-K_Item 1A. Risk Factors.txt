Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Described below are certain risks to our business
and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information
contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our future
results could differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of our future financial
performance, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.

Risks Related to Our Business

Bitcoin price volatility may affect our ability to effectively manage our growth plans and profitability.

The market price of bitcoin
is extremely volatile, and in fiscal 2024 the price range of bitcoin was between approximately $39,000 and $106,000. The cost to mine
a bitcoin is independent of the then current price of bitcoin, so when bitcoin prices are low, the cost per coin to mine may consume much
of our available cash, limiting our ability to invest in expansion, upgrade mining equipment and infrastructure or fund other strategic
initiatives. Additionally, because our revenue is primarily derived from mining bitcoin, our profitability fluctuates in direct correlation
with bitcoin price movements. A decrease in bitcoin’s price results in a corresponding decrease in the value of the bitcoin we mine,
reducing our revenues and profitability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Given the volatility of bitcoin prices, we are unable to accurately
predict our future growth trajectory or reliably forecast our revenue and profitability for any given reporting period. Our ability to
expand our operations depends on our assumptions regarding bitcoin’s future price. If those assumptions are incorrect, and bitcoin
prices fail to reach or sustain levels high enough to justify our capital expenditures, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue
to maintain profitability or execute our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Gryphon’s success depends upon the
value of Bitcoin; the value of Bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been subject to wide swings.

Gryphon’s operating
results depend on the value of Bitcoin because it is the only cryptocurrency that Gryphon mines. Specifically, Gryphon’s revenues
from its bitcoin mining operations are based on two factors: (1) the number of bitcoin rewards Gryphon successfully mines and (2) the
value of Bitcoin. In addition, Gryphon’s operating results are directly impacted by changes in the value of Bitcoin, because under
the value measurement model, impairment of Bitcoin and realized gains will be reflected in Gryphon’s statement of operations (i.e.,
Gryphon will be marking bitcoin to fair value each closing period). This means that Gryphon’s operating results will be subject
to swings based upon increases or decreases in the value of Bitcoin. Further, Gryphon’s current application-specific integrated
circuit, or ASIC, machines (which Gryphon refers to as “miners”) are principally utilized for mining bitcoin and cannot mine
other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, that are not mined utilizing the “SHA-256 algorithm.” If other cryptocurrencies were
to achieve acceptance at the expense of Bitcoin causing the value of Bitcoin to decline, or if Bitcoin were to switch its proof of work
algorithm from SHA-256 to another algorithm for which Gryphon’s miners are not specialized, or the value of Bitcoin were to decline
for other reasons, particularly if such decline were significant or over an extended period of time, Gryphon’s operating results
would be adversely affected, and there could be a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or
to pursue Gryphon’s strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations,
and harm investors.

Bitcoin market prices, which
have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed below), are determined primarily using
data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such
as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or
illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of,
and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of Bitcoin, which inflates and makes its market
prices more volatile or creates “bubble” type risks for Bitcoin.

11

Regulatory, commercial and technical uncertainties
may influence bitcoin prices.

The market price of bitcoin
is subject to numerous uncertainties, including evolving regulatory frameworks, commercial adoption trends and technical risks, any of
which could negatively impact its value. Regulatory treatment of digital assets remains uncertain in various jurisdictions, and new regulations,
enforcement actions, or interpretations by governmental authorities could diminish bitcoin’s appeal, restrict its use or otherwise
depress its market price.

Beyond regulation, bitcoin’s price is influenced by factors such as:

●
public perception and media coverage of bitcoin and digital assets;

●
accessibility and convenience of purchasing, holding and transacting with bitcoin;

●
institutional demand for bitcoin as an asset class;

●
consumer adoption of bitcoin for everyday transactions; and

●
emergence of competing digital assets with potentially superior functionality, scalability or regulatory
compliance.

Even if bitcoin adoption increases
in the short term, there is no guarantee that this growth will be sustained. Since bitcoin exists solely as digital records on the Bitcoin
blockchain, its value is also susceptible to technical risks, including:

●
a decrease in miner incentives due to declining block rewards and transaction fees;

●
security vulnerabilities, such as potential network attacks or software exploits;

●
forks or changes to the Bitcoin protocol that may split the network or cause instability; and

●
developments in mathematics or technology, including in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum
computing, that could result in the cryptography used by the Bitcoin blockchain becoming insecure or ineffective.

Additionally, bitcoin’s
liquidity could be adversely affected if financial institutions, payment processors or market makers withdraw their support for bitcoin-related
services due to regulatory pressure, reputational concerns or operational risks. If any of these risks materialize, they could negatively
impact bitcoin’s market price, which, in turn, would adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Failure to increase our hashrate may reduce our competitiveness and negatively impact our financial performance.

Our ability to earn bitcoin
rewards is directly proportional to our mining power, or hashrate, relative to the total hashrate of the Bitcoin network. As more miners
enter the network and deploy more powerful mining equipment, the global hashrate increases, making it more difficult to successfully mine
bitcoin. To remain competitive, we must continuously invest in expanding our hashrate by acquiring new, more efficient mining hardware.
However, as demand for mining equipment grows, the cost of acquiring and deploying new miners increases, which could limit our ability
to scale. If we are unable to access capital to acquire additional miners, our hashrate may stagnate and we may fall behind our competitors.
If we fail to increase our hashrate at a pace that keeps up with network difficulty growth, our share of total bitcoin mining rewards
will decline, reducing our revenue and negatively impacting our financial performance.

12

Gryphon may face several risks due to disruptions
in the crypto asset markets, including but not limited to the risk from depreciation in Gryphon’s stock price, financing risk, risk
of increased losses or impairments in its investments or other assets, risks of legal proceedings and government investigations, and risks
from price declines or price volatility of crypto assets.

The use of crypto assets to,
among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete other transactions is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that
employs crypto assets based upon a computer generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. The growth of this industry in general,
and the use of crypto assets in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development
or acceptance of developing protocols may adversely affect Gryphon’s operations. The factors affecting the further development of
the industry, include, but are not limited to:

●

Continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of crypto assets;

●

Governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of crypto assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the network or similar crypto asset systems;

●

Changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;

●

The maintenance and development of the open source software protocol of the network;

●

The availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;

●

General economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to crypto assets; and

●

Consumer sentiment and perception of Bitcoin specifically and crypto assets generally.

Many crypto asset exchanges
currently do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices
or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, crypto asset exchanges,
which may cause the price of Bitcoin to decline. For example, in the first half of 2022, each of Celsius Network LLC, et al. (“Celsius”),
Voyager Digital Ltd., et al. (“Voyager”), and Three Arrows Capital (“Three Arrows”) declared bankruptcy, resulting
in a loss of confidence among participants in the crypto asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding crypto assets more broadly.
In November 2022, BlockFi Inc. (“BlockFi”) and FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), the third largest crypto asset exchange
by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals and shortly thereafter, FTX and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy. In December
2022, Core Scientific Inc. (“Core”), one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy.
In January 2023, Genesis Global Holdco, LLC, et al. (“Genesis”) filed for bankruptcy.

In response to these events,
the crypto asset markets, including the market for Bitcoin specifically, have experienced extreme price volatility and several other entities
in the crypto asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the crypto asset
market and in Bitcoin. These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the crypto asset market as certain entities affiliated
with FTX engaged in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the crypto asset market continues to be negatively impacted by these
events, crypto asset prices, including the price of Bitcoin, may continue to experience significant volatility and confidence in the crypto
asset markets may be further undermined. A perceived lack of stability in the crypto asset exchange market and the closure or temporary
shutdown of crypto asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation or fraud, may reduce confidence
at least in part in crypto asset networks and result in greater volatility in Bitcoin’s value. Because the value of Bitcoin is derived
from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange government-issued currency that is designated as legal tender in its
country of issuance through government decree, regulation or law for Bitcoin, should the marketplace for Bitcoin be jeopardized or disappear
entirely, permanent and total loss of the value of Bitcoin may result. Such a decrease in Bitcoin price may have a material and adverse
effect on Gryphon’s results of operations and financial condition as the results of Gryphon’s operations are significantly
tied to the price of Bitcoin.

The failure or insolvency
of large exchanges like FTX may cause the price of Bitcoin to fall and decrease confidence in the ecosystem, which could adversely affect
an investment in Gryphon. Such market volatility and decrease in Bitcoin price may have a material and adverse effect on Gryphon’s
results of operations and financial condition as the results of Gryphon’s operations are significantly tied to the price of Bitcoin.

As of the date hereof, Gryphon
has not experienced any material impact resulting from the bankruptcy filings of FTX, Three Arrows, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and Genesis
and the attendant disruptions in the crypto asset markets. Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group Inc. (“DCG”), which
also owns Foundry Digital LLC (“Foundry”), one of Gryphon’s mining pool providers. However, at this time, Gryphon believes
it is not subject to any material risks arising from its previous exposure to Genesis. Other than the Genesis entities, Gryphon (i) has
no direct exposure to any crypto asset entities that have recently filed for bankruptcy; (ii) has no assets that may not be recovered
due to these bankruptcies; and (iii) has no exposure to any other counterparties, customers, custodians or other crypto asset market third
parties known to Gryphon to have (x) experienced material excessive redemptions or withdrawals or suspended redemptions or withdrawals
of crypto assets, (y) the crypto assets of their customers unaccounted for, or (z) experienced material compliance failures.

13

The adoption and long-term viability of
digital asset networks is uncertain, and a decline in their growth or acceptance could negatively impact our business and the value of
our stock.

Bitcoin and other digital
assets are part of a new and rapidly evolving industry. The long-term growth and viability of digital assets depend on multiple factors,
including:

●
continued global adoption and usage of bitcoin and other digital assets;

●
government regulations that impact digital asset transactions and network operations;

●
the development and maintenance of Bitcoin’s open-source software protocol;

●
shifting consumer demographics, preferences and payment habits;

●
the availability and popularity of alternative payment methods, including improved fiat currency solutions;

●
economic conditions and the regulatory environment for digital assets; and

●
regulatory scrutiny and associated compliance costs.

If bitcoin adoption stagnates
or declines, demand for bitcoin could weaken, which could negatively affect our business. A prolonged lack of growth in bitcoin adoption
could reduce market confidence, leading to lower trading volumes and diminished liquidity. Additionally, bitcoin’s price volatility
undermines its role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are less likely to accept it as a form of payment. Marketplace acceptance of
bitcoin as a medium of exchange and payment method may remain low. The relative lack of acceptance of bitcoin in the retail and commercial
marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to use bitcoin to pay for goods and services.

Further, as block rewards
decrease, higher transaction fees may be required to incentivize miners, potentially reducing bitcoin adoption and value. In order to
incentivize miners to continue to contribute processing power to any digital asset network, such network may either formally or informally
transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a block. This transition could be accomplished either by miners
independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee or by the
digital asset network adopting software upgrades that require the payment of a minimum transaction fee for all transactions. If transaction
fees paid for digital asset transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept digital assets as a means of payment
and existing users may be motivated to switch from one digital asset to another digital asset or back to fiat currency. A decline in bitcoin
transactions and adoption could reduce demand, negatively impacting bitcoin’s price and affecting the value of our bitcoin holdings.

Geopolitical and economic crises could lead
to increased uncertainty, large-scale selloffs of digital assets and a decline in bitcoin’s value, negatively impacting our business
and stock price.

Bitcoin is an alternative
to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, but its value is highly dependent on supply and demand. It is unclear how global
geopolitical and economic crises will affect the adoption and valuation of digital assets. However, such crises may lead to large-scale
acquisitions or sales of digital assets, causing significant price volatility. A large-scale selloff of bitcoin could decrease its value,
directly affecting our business and the price of our common stock. Additionally, broader macroeconomic instability, inflation and regulatory
uncertainty could impact our ability to conduct business efficiently and profitably. A significant decline in bitcoin’s value due
to economic or geopolitical factors could negatively affect our financial condition.

We face risks related to technological obsolescence,
vulnerability of the global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware, potential trade restrictions and difficulty in obtaining new hardware,
which may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Bitcoin mining hardware experiences
wear and tear over time, requiring periodic repairs or replacement to maintain efficiency. Additionally, as mining technology evolves,
we must invest in newer, more efficient mining equipment to remain competitive, which requires significant capital expenditures.

14

Further, we have faced complications
related to the import of mining equipment in the past and may face such complications in the future. The global supply of miners is unpredictable
and presently heavily dependent on manufacturers based in China. Geopolitical matters, including the relationship between the United States
and other countries and trade restrictions and tariffs (or the threat of trade restrictions or tariffs), may impact our ability to import
miners or other equipment necessary for our operations. Restrictions or bans on mining equipment from China, whether due to trade restrictions,
national security concerns or geopolitical tensions, could disrupt our supply chain, increase equipment costs and delay our growth plans.

In addition, officials of
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (“CBP”) have broad discretion regarding products imported into the United States,
and the CBP has on occasion detained or seized imported miners and other equipment necessary to the operation of our miners, which has
resulted in significant costs to us. If our imported mining equipment is detained or seized in the future, we may not be able to obtain
adequate replacement parts for our existing miners and other equipment or obtain additional miners and other equipment from manufacturers
on a timely basis or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Bitcoin network forks, where the blockchain
splits into two separate networks, could cause disruptions and negatively impact our business.

Since the Bitcoin network
is an open-source project, any individual can download the Bitcoin network software and make any desired modifications, which are proposed
to users and miners on the Bitcoin network through software downloads and upgrades and typically posted to the Bitcoin development forum
on GitHub.com. A substantial majority of miners and Bitcoin users must consent to those software modifications by downloading the altered
software or upgrade that implements the changes. Otherwise, the changes do not become a part of the Bitcoin network.

Since the Bitcoin network’s
inception, changes to the network have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners, ensuring that the network remains a coherent
economic system. However, a developer or group of developers could propose a modification to the Bitcoin network that is not accepted
by a vast majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial population of participants in the Bitcoin network.
In such a case, and if the modification is material or not compatible with the prior version of Bitcoin network software, a fork in the
blockchain could develop and two separate Bitcoin networks could result with one running the pre-modification software program and the
other running the modified version (i.e., a second “Bitcoin” network).

Historically, the Bitcoin
community has worked to merge forked blockchains, but a prolonged or unresolved split could create confusion, disrupt the network and
affect bitcoin’s stability. A fork could decrease confidence in bitcoin, negatively impacting its price and, in turn, our business
and stock value.  

A 51% attack on the Bitcoin network could
undermine security and market confidence.

The security of the Bitcoin
network relies on its decentralized nature, which makes it difficult for any single entity to control a majority of the network’s
mining power. However, if a malicious actor or coordinated group were to gain control of more than 50% of the total hashrate, a scenario
known as a “51% attack,” they could theoretically manipulate the network by:

●
reversing previously confirmed transactions, enabling double-spending
of bitcoin;

●
preventing new transactions from being confirmed, effectively
halting the network; and

●
excluding or modifying transactions, undermining the trustworthiness
of the blockchain.

A 51% attack could occur through
several mechanisms, including large-scale mining operations, through which a single entity invests in expansive mining facilities with
enough computing power to control the majority of the network; mining pool dominance, in which mining pool becomes so large that it collectively
controls more than 50% of the network’s hashrate; or botnet-based attacks, in which botnets (volunteers or hacked collections of
computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) are used to hijack computing resources and direct
them toward mining, effectively amassing enough power to launch an attack.

15

If a 51% attack were successfully
executed, it could lead to a loss of confidence in bitcoin’s security and reliability, causing its price to drop significantly.
Such an event could also prompt regulatory restrictions on cryptocurrency mining and trading, further exacerbating the negative impact
on our business.

Even if a 51% attack does
not occur, the mere perception that such an attack is possible could damage bitcoin’s credibility and discourage institutional adoption.
Given our dependence on bitcoin mining, any loss of trust in the security of the Bitcoin network could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Noise generated by our mining operations
poses regulatory, legal, operational and reputational risks.

Our mining operations involve
the use of a large number of high-powered miners and cooling systems that generate substantial noise. This noise poses risks to our business,
including community complaints, reputational damage, litigation risk, regulatory risk, operational constraints, increased costs and opposition
to expansion. These risks could lead to fines or penalties imposed by local governments, requirements to implement costly noise mitigation
measures, restrictions on our operating hours, reduction of scale of our operations, stricter noise controls regulations on our operations,
potential shutdown of data centers that cannot meet local noise regulations, damages resulting from lawsuits and difficulty obtaining
necessary permits and approvals for expanding existing data centers or establishing new site operations. These risks may negatively affect
our financial condition and results of operations.

We may experience liquidity constraints
and need additional capital, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.

Liquidity risk is the possibility
that we will be unable to meet our financial obligations as they come due. We will need to raise additional capital to expand our operations,
pursue our growth strategy in AI and HPC and respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. We may seek
but fail to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely affect
our existing operations. Raising capital through equity financing could dilute existing stockholders and reduce the value of their investment.
Debt financing, on the other hand, could impose restrictive terms, prioritize creditors over stockholders or require us to maintain liquidity
levels or financial ratios that may not align with our business needs or be in the best interest of our stockholders.

The lack of regulation of digital asset
exchanges which Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are traded on, may expose Gryphon to the effects of negative publicity resulting
from fraudulent actors in the cryptocurrency space, and can adversely affect an investment in Gryphon.

The digital asset exchanges
on which Bitcoin is traded are relatively new and largely unregulated. Many digital asset exchanges do not provide the public with significant
information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices, or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace
may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, such digital asset exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a
significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. In 2022, FTX and a number of other digital asset exchanges filed for bankruptcy
proceedings after failing to solve financial issues caused by the falling prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. FTX and others
became the subjects of investigations by various governmental agencies for, among other things, fraud, which caused a loss of confidence
in cryptocurrency market participants and an increase in negative publicity for the digital asset ecosystem. As a result, many digital
asset markets, including the market for Bitcoin, did and continue to experience increased price volatility. The Bitcoin ecosystem may
continue to be negatively impacted and experience long term volatility if public confidence cannot rebound or decreases again due similar
future events.

These events are continuing
to develop and it is not possible to predict, at this time, every risk that they may pose to Gryphon, Gryphon’s service providers,
or the digital asset industry as a whole. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary
shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce
confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a digital
asset exchange’s failure could adversely affect an investment in Gryphon.

16

The U.S. political and economic environment
could materially impact our business operations and financial performance, and uncertainty surrounding the potential legal, regulatory
and policy changes by the new U.S. presidential administration may directly affect us and the global economy.

Changes in U.S. political
leadership and economic policies may create uncertainty that materially affects our business and financial performance. Shifts in legal,
regulatory, and trade policies, particularly under a new presidential administration, could disrupt our operations and long-term strategy.

For example, if the U.S. government
establishes a strategic bitcoin reserve, large-scale purchases could create price volatility or artificial price suppression, making our
mining operations less profitable. Conversely, slow or no action in creating such a reserve could limit institutional adoption and negatively
impact bitcoin’s value, which could also harm our financial condition. Additionally, increased government influence over the Bitcoin
network could affect mining difficulty, transaction processing, and other technical aspects, further impacting our business.

We also face risks from trade
policy changes, including tariffs and restrictions on imports of mining equipment. The current administration has imposed, and may continue
to impose, tariffs on imports from key manufacturing regions, increasing costs and disrupting supply chains.

The scope and timing of potential
policy changes remain uncertain, making it difficult to plan for or mitigate these risks. Any such changes could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have engaged in, and may continue to engage in, strategic acquisitions and other transactions that could disrupt our business, dilute
our stockholders, strain our financial resources and harm our operating results.

As part of our growth strategy,
we have pursued strategic transactions, including the Captus Acquisition, miners and data centers. In the future, we may seek additional
opportunities to expand our mining operations, including purchasing energy assets, HPC and AI assets, miners, data centers and other facilities,
potentially from companies in financial distress. Our ability to grow through acquisitions depends on several factors, including the availability
of suitable opportunities at acceptable costs, our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and access to financing.

Acquisitions may require us
to issue common stock, thereby diluting existing stockholders, or take on liabilities from acquired businesses. They may also result in
recording goodwill and intangible assets that require regular impairment testing, which could lead to periodic write-downs. Additionally,
acquisitions often involve significant costs, including integration expenses, restructuring charges and potential litigation risks.

Even when successful, acquisitions
and expansions may take considerable time to deliver anticipated benefits, if at all. Integrating new businesses, technologies, and personnel
can be complex and may divert management’s attention from daily operations. We may also face liabilities related to a target company’s
past operations. Entering new markets where we have little experience could pose additional challenges, particularly if competitors have
stronger market positions. Furthermore, we may struggle to generate sufficient revenue to justify acquisition costs, and the integration
process could disrupt relationships with employees, suppliers and other stakeholders.

Further, we may not be able
to pursue our current acquisition strategy in the future. Beyond energy assets, HPC and AI assets, bitcoin mining and related acquisitions,
we have explored, and may continue to explore, opportunities in adjacent or complementary businesses as market conditions allow. These
ventures may carry similar risks, including operational and financial challenges, and there is no guarantee they will provide the expected
benefits in a timely manner, if at all.

17

The Bitcoin market is exposed to financially
troubled cryptocurrency-based companies.

The failure of several cryptocurrency
platforms has impacted and may continue to impact the broader cryptocurrency economy; the full extent of these impacts may not yet be
known. Bitcoin is part of the cryptocurrency environment and is subject to price volatility resulting from financial instability, poor
business practices, and fraudulent activities of players in the cryptocurrency market. When investors in cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency-based
companies experience financial difficulty as a result of price volatility, poor business practices, and/or fraud, it has caused, and may
continue to cause, loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency space, reputational harm to cryptocurrency assets, heightened scrutiny by
regulatory authorities and law makers, and a steep decline in the value of Bitcoin, among other material impacts. Such adverse effects
have affected, and may in the future continue to affect, the profitability of Gryphon’s bitcoin mining operations.

The lack of legal recourse and insurance
for our digital assets increases the risk of total loss in the event of theft or destruction.

Our digital assets are not
insured against theft, loss or destruction. If an event occurs where we lose our digital assets, whether due to cyberattacks, fraud or
other malicious activities, we may not have any viable legal recourse or ability to recover the lost assets. Unlike funds held in insured
banking institutions, our digital assets are not protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation. If our digital assets are lost under circumstances that render another party liable, there is no guarantee that the responsible
party will have the financial resources to compensate us. As a result, we and our stockholders could face significant financial losses.

There is a lack of liquid markets for, and
possible manipulation of, blockchain/cryptocurrency-based assets.

Cryptocurrencies that are
represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock exchanges have listing
requirements and vet issuers, requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors transacting
on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform,
depending on the platform’s controls and other policies. The more relaxed a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers
of cryptocurrency assets or users that transact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of the ledger
due to a control event. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or
other assets trading on a ledger-based system. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue
as a going concern or to pursue its strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects
or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or holds for its own account, which in
turn could harm investors.

Acceptance and/or widespread use of Bitcoin
are uncertain.

Currently, there is a relatively
limited use of Bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process
funds for Bitcoin transactions, process wire transfers to or from Bitcoin exchanges, Bitcoin-related companies or service providers, or
maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting in Bitcoin. Conversely, a significant portion of Bitcoin demand is generated by
investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of the asset. Price
volatility undermines Bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are much less likely to accept it as a form of payment.
Market capitalization for Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and payment method may always be low.

The relative lack of acceptance
of Bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace limits the ability of end users to use bitcoin to pay for goods and services. Such
lack of acceptance could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue Gryphon’s
strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations and potentially the value
of Bitcoin Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or holds for its own account.

The further development and
acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety
of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely
affect an investment in Gryphon.

18

The use of cryptocurrencies
to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that
employs cryptocurrency assets, including Bitcoin, based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale
acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of Bitcoin
in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing
protocols may occur unpredictably. The factors include, but are not limited to:

●

continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange;

●

governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of Bitcoin and its use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the Bitcoin network or similar cryptocurrency systems;

●

changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;

●

the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network;

●

the increased consolidation of contributors to the Bitcoin blockchain through mining pools;

●

the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;

●

the use of the networks supporting cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;

●

general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and

●

negative consumer sentiment and perception of Bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.

The outcome of these factors
could have negative effects on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue Gryphon’s business strategy at
all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations as well as a potentially negative
effect on the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or holds for Gryphon’s own account, which would harm
investors.

The bitcoin reward for successfully uncovering
a block will halve several times in the future and Bitcoin value may not adjust to compensate Gryphon for the reduction in the rewards
Gryphon receives from its mining efforts.

Halving is a process designed
to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. At a predetermined
block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving.” For Bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoin
currency rewards per block. This was cut in half to 25 on November 28, 2012 at block 210,000, and then again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at
block 420,000. The most recent halving for Bitcoin happened on April 19, 2024, and the reward reduced to 3.125. This process will reoccur
until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected around 2140.

While Bitcoin prices have
historically increased around these halving events, which increases in price have correspondingly mitigated the decrease in mining reward,
there is no guarantee that the price change would be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding
and proportionate increase in the trading price of Bitcoin or a proportionate decrease in mining difficulty does not follow these anticipated
halving events, the revenue Gryphon earns from its bitcoin mining operations would see a corresponding decrease, which would have a material
adverse effect on Gryphon’s business and the economics of Gryphon’s mining operations.

Gryphon aims to mitigate the
impacts of halving by maintaining a breakeven profitability floor far below the network average. To do so, Gryphon has developed and implemented
a curtailment agreement with its hosting partners to maximize the marginal profitability of its machines.

Gryphon’s partners have
also implemented standard operating procedures to maximize the operational efficiency of its sites, such as preventative maintenance and
cleaning of equipment. Gryphon believes that these steps can enable it to maintain survivability above its competitors and mitigate the
downside risk of decreased rewards.

Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, face
significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.

Cryptocurrencies face significant
scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions
may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, which
widespread acceptance is important to the continued growth and development of Gryphon’s business. Many cryptocurrency networks,
including the Bitcoin network, face significant scaling challenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many
transactions can occur per second. Participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem debate potential approaches to increasing the average
number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or are researching ways to increase scale,
such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and sharding (a horizontal partition
of data in a database or search engine), which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s
or validator’s block. However, there is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale
of settlement of cryptocurrency and, specifically, Bitcoin transactions will be effective, or how long they will take to become effective,
which could adversely affect Gryphon’s business.

Transaction fees may decrease demand for
Bitcoin and prevent expansion that could adversely impact an investment in Gryphon.

As the number of bitcoins
awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to contribute to the Bitcoin network may transition
from a set reward to transaction fees. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute to the Bitcoin network, the Bitcoin network
may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving a block. This transition could
be accomplished by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a
transaction fee. If transaction fees paid for Bitcoin transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept Bitcoin
as a means of payment and existing users may be motivated to switch from Bitcoin to another cryptocurrency or to fiat currency. Either
the requirement from miners of higher transaction fees in exchange for recording transactions in a blockchain or a software upgrade that
automatically charges fees for all transactions may decrease demand for Bitcoin and prevent the expansion of the Bitcoin network to retail
merchants and commercial businesses, resulting in a reduction in the price of Bitcoin that could adversely impact Gryphon’s business.
Decreased use and demand for bitcoins that Gryphon has accumulated may adversely affect their value and may adversely impact an investment
in Gryphon.

The price of Bitcoin may be affected by
the sale of Bitcoin by other vehicles investing in Bitcoin or tracking Bitcoin markets.

The global market for Bitcoin
is characterized by supply constraints that differ from those present in the markets for commodities or other assets such as gold and
silver. The mathematical protocols under which Bitcoin is mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount of currency, while
others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in Bitcoin or tracking Bitcoin markets form
and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for Bitcoin, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and the
subsequent sale of Bitcoin by such vehicles could negatively affect Bitcoin prices and therefore affect the value of the Bitcoin holdings
Gryphon holds. Such events could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue
Gryphon’s new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations and
potentially the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or holds for its own account.

The development of other cryptocurrencies
and/or digital currencies may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin.

To the extent that other cryptocurrencies
are introduced into the market, gain traction and are supported by the deployment of significant resources, the success of any such cryptocurrency
could lead to a decrease in demand and the potential exclusion of existing cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.

In addition, central banks
in some countries have started to introduce digital forms of legal tender. Whether or not they incorporate blockchain or similar technology,
central bank digital currencies as legal tender in the issuing jurisdiction could have an advantage in competing with, or replacing, Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange or store of value. As a result, the value of Bitcoin could decrease, which could have
a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.

20

If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control
in excess of 50% of the processing power active on any digital asset network, including the Bitcoin network, it is possible that such
actor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain in a manner that adversely affects an investment in Gryphon.

If a malicious actor or botnet
(a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority
of the processing power dedicated to mining on any digital asset network, including the Bitcoin network, it may be able to alter the blockchain
by constructing alternate blocks if it is able to solve for such blocks faster than the remainder of the miners on the blockchain can
add valid blocks. In such alternate blocks, the malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions,
though it could not generate new digital assets or transactions using such control. Using alternate blocks, the malicious actor could
“double-spend” its own digital assets (i.e., spend the same digital assets in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation
of other users’ transactions for so long as it maintains control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield
its majority control of the processing power or the digital asset community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing
any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible. Such changes could adversely affect an investment in Gryphon.

For example, in late May and
early June 2014, a mining pool known as GHash.io approached and, during a 24- to 48-hour period may have exceeded, the threshold of 50%
of the processing power on the Bitcoin network. To the extent that GHash.io did exceed 50% of the processing power on the network, reports
indicate that such threshold was surpassed for only a short period, and there are no reports of any malicious activity or control of the
blockchain performed by GHash.io. Furthermore, the processing power in the mining pool appears to have been redirected to other pools
on a voluntary basis by participants in the GHash.io pool, as had been done in prior instances when a mining pool exceeded 40% of the
processing power on the Bitcoin network.

The approach towards and possible
crossing of the 50% threshold indicate a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of digital asset
transactions. To the extent that the digital assets ecosystems do not act to ensure greater decentralization of digital asset mining processing
power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining in excess of 50% of the processing power on any digital asset network (e.g., through
control of a large mining pool or through hacking such a mining pool) will increase, which may adversely impact an investment in Gryphon.

The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency
systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect Gryphon’s business.

The decentralized nature of
the governance of cryptocurrency systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a network from overcoming
emergent obstacles. Governance of many cryptocurrency systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear leadership
structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of the Bitcoin blockchain leads to ineffective decision
making that slows development and growth of the Bitcoin network protocol, Gryphon’s business may be adversely affected.

The open-source structure
of the Bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions
in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the Bitcoin network and
an investment in Gryphon.

The Bitcoin network operates
based on an open-source protocol maintained by contributors, largely on the Bitcoin Core project on GitHub. As an open-source project,
Bitcoin is not represented by an official organization or authority. As the Bitcoin network protocol is not sold and its use does not
generate revenues for contributors, contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the Bitcoin network protocol.
The lack of guaranteed financial incentive for contributors to maintain or develop the Bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources
to adequately address emerging issues with the Bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner.
Changes to a digital asset network that Gryphon is mining on may adversely affect an investment in Gryphon.

21

The impact of geopolitical and economic
events on the supply and demand for Bitcoin is uncertain.

Geopolitical crises may motivate
large-scale purchases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rapidly.
This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, which would adversely
affect the value of Gryphon’s Bitcoin value following such downward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing
commodities in uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with
limited acceptance as a payment system or commodity, global crises and general economic downturns may discourage investment in Bitcoin
as investors focus their investments on less volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risks.

As an alternative to fiat
currencies that are backed by central governments, Bitcoin, which is relatively new, is subject to supply and demand forces. How such
supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to Gryphon. Political or economic
crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of Bitcoin either globally or locally. Such events could have a material adverse
effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue Gryphon’s new strategy at all, which could have a
material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines
or otherwise acquires or holds for its own account.

Gryphon faces risks of Internet disruptions,
which could have an adverse effect on the price of Bitcoin.

A disruption of the Internet
may affect the use of Bitcoin. Generally, Bitcoin and Gryphon’s business of mining Bitcoin are dependent upon the Internet. A significant
disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt a currency’s network operations until the disruption is resolved and have an
adverse effect on the price of Bitcoin and Gryphon’s ability to mine bitcoin.

Fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may
significantly influence the market price of our bitcoin holdings and therefore, the price of our common stock.

To the extent investors view
the value of our common stock as linked to the value or change in the value of our bitcoin, fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may
significantly influence the market price of our common stock.

If we fail to grow our hash rate, we may
be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer.

Generally, a bitcoin miner’s
chance of solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain and earning a bitcoin reward is a function of the miner’s hash rate (i.e.,
the amount of computing power devoted to supporting the Bitcoin blockchain), relative to the global network hash rate. As greater adoption
of Bitcoin occurs, we expect the demand for Bitcoin will increase further, drawing more mining companies into the industry and thereby
increasing the global network hash rate. As new and more powerful miners are deployed, the global network hash rate will continue to
increase, meaning a miner’s chance of earning bitcoin rewards will decline unless it deploys additional hash rate at pace with
the industry. Accordingly, to maintain our chances of earning new bitcoin rewards and remaining competitive in our industry, we must
seek to continually add new miners to grow our hash rate at pace with the growth in the Bitcoin global network hash rate. However, as
demand has increased and scarcity in the supply of new miners has resulted, the price of new miners has increased sharply, and we expect
this process to continue in the future as demand for bitcoin increases. Therefore, if the price of bitcoin is not sufficiently high to
allow us to fund our hash rate growth through new miner acquisitions and if we are otherwise unable to access additional capital to acquire
these miners, our hash rate may stagnate and we may fall behind our competitors. If this happens, our chances of earning new bitcoin
rewards would decline and, as such, our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.

Risks Related to Operations

Gryphon is an early-stage company and has
a limited history of generating profits.

Gryphon was formed in October
2020 and has a limited history upon which an evaluation of Gryphon’s performance and future prospects can be made. Gryphon began
mining operations in September 2021, and had no previous existing operations. Gryphon’s current and proposed operations are subject
to all of the business risks associated with new enterprises. These include likely fluctuations in operating results as Gryphon reacts
to developments in its market, manages its growth and operations, and responds to the entry of competitors into the market. Further,
there is no assurance that Gryphon can successfully execute its business plan. Gryphon has had limited revenues generated since its bitcoin
miners became operational in September 2021, and consequently recorded losses in 2024, 2023, 2021 and 2020. Gryphon generated minimal
profits in 2022 and may not be able to sustain profitability in the future.

Gryphon may be unable to access sufficient
additional capital to fund its operations or for future strategic growth initiatives.

Gryphon’s purchase
of miners is a capital intensive, and Gryphon anticipates that future strategic growth initiatives will likewise be capital-intensive.
Gryphon expects to raise additional capital to fund its operations and future strategic growth initiatives. If Gryphon raises additional
capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of Gryphon’s existing stockholders will be diluted,
and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect Gryphon’s stockholders’
rights. If Gryphon raises additional capital through debt financing, Gryphon may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting Gryphon’s
ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or liens, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Further,
Gryphon may be unable to raise capital in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities, or on terms acceptable to Gryphon, if at all. If
Gryphon is unable to raise the additional capital needed to fund its operations or execute future strategic growth initiatives, Gryphon
may be less competitive in its industry and its results of operations and financial condition may suffer. The value of its securities
may also be materially and adversely affected.

Gryphon’s independent registered
public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about Gryphon’s ability
continue as a “going concern.”

Gryphon’s consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”),
which contemplate the continuation of Gryphon as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
ordinary course of business.

Since Gryphon began revenue
generation in September 2021, management has financed Gryphon’s operations through equity and debt financing and the sale of the
digital assets earned through mining operations.

Gryphon may incur additional
losses from operations and negative cash outflows from operations in the foreseeable future. In the event Gryphon does incur losses,
it may need to raise debt or equity financing to finance its operations until operations are cashflow positive. However, there can be
no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms, when and if needed, or at all. The
precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time and will depend on several factors, including
the market price for the underlying commodity mined by Gryphon, the potential cost of funding Captus Energy and its ability to procure
equipment and operate profitably. Gryphon’s financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

Gryphon’s loss of any of its management
or advisory team, its inability to execute an effective succession plan, or its inability to attract and retain qualified personnel,
could adversely affect Gryphon’s business.

Gryphon’s success and
future growth will depend to a significant degree on the skills and services of its management and advisors, including Steve Gutterman,
Gryphon’s Chief Executive Officer and Sim Salzman, Gryphon’s Chief Financial Officer. Gryphon will need to continue to grow
its management in order to alleviate pressure on its existing team and in order to continue to develop its business. If Gryphon’s
management, including any new hires that Gryphon may make, fail to work together effectively and to execute Gryphon’s plans and
strategies on a timely basis, Gryphon’s business could be harmed. Furthermore, if Gryphon fails to execute an effective contingency
or succession plan with the loss of any member of management, the loss of such management personnel may significantly disrupt its business.

23

The loss of key members of
management or advisory team could inhibit Gryphon’s growth prospects. Gryphon’s future success also depends in large part
on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key management and operating personnel. As Gryphon continues to develop and expand its
operations and pursue new strategies, it may require personnel with different skills and experiences, and who have sound understandings
of Gryphon’s business and both the Bitcoin network industry and the AI and HPC industry. The market for highly qualified personnel
in these industries is very competitive, and Gryphon may be unable to attract such personnel. If Gryphon is unable to attract such personnel,
its business could be harmed.

Gryphon’s bitcoin may be subject
to loss, theft or restriction on access.

There is a risk that some
or all of Gryphon’s bitcoin could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as
“wallets” by holders of cryptocurrencies, which may be accessed to exchange a holder’s cryptocurrency assets. Access
to Gryphon’s bitcoin assets could also be restricted by cybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which
Gryphon maintains a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally,
hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical
vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Gryphon holds its bitcoin solely
in cold custodial wallets with keys managed by BitGo Trust. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal
for quick or regular transactions, and Gryphon may experience lag time in its ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price
of Gryphon’s bitcoin assets.

Hackers or malicious actors
may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoin, such as by attacking the Bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party
platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, through phishing schemes or by other means. Several errors and defects in such
codes have been found previously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users’ information. Exploitations
of flaws in the source code that allow malicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite Gryphon’s efforts
and processes to prevent breaches, Gryphon’s devices, as well as Gryphon’s miners, computer systems and those of third parties
that Gryphon uses in its operations, are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyberattacks such as viruses and worms, phishing
attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized
tampering with Gryphon’s miners and computer systems or those of third parties that Gryphon uses in its operations. Any of these
events may adversely affect Gryphon’s operations and, consequently, Gryphon’s investments and profitability. The loss or
destruction of a private key required to access Gryphon’s digital wallets may be irreversible and Gryphon may be denied access
for all time to its bitcoin holdings or the holdings of others held in those compromised wallets. Gryphon’s loss of access to its
private keys or a data loss relating to Gryphon’s digital wallets could adversely affect Gryphon’s investments and assets.

Cryptocurrencies are controllable
only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held,
which wallet’s public key or address is reflected in the network’s public blockchain. Gryphon will publish the public key
relating to digital wallets in use when Gryphon verifies the receipt of transfers and disseminates such information into the network,
but Gryphon will need to safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. We safeguard and keep private the private keys
relating to our digital assets by relying on BitGo Trust’s (as defined herein) 100% cold storage custody solution held in a purpose-built
physically-secure environment based on established, industry best practices to safeguard our digital assets from theft, loss, destruction
or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Gryphon’s CEO holds Gryphon side private keys that are protected
with two-factor authentication. Gryphon confirms transactional validity and data for revenue recognition through a daily review and reconciliation
of BitGo reports. Custodial side keys are held by BitGo Trust who verifies requests with two factor authentication and video reviews.
To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, Gryphon will be unable to access its bitcoin rewards and
such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store
Gryphon’s bitcoin could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue its
new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations and potentially
the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or holds for its own account.

24

Our ability to adopt technology in response
to changing security needs or trends and reliance on third party, Bitgo Prime, for custody poses a challenge to the safekeeping of our
digital assets.

The history of digital asset
exchanges has shown that exchanges and large holders of digital assets must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard
their digital assets. We rely on Bitgo Trust’s 100% cold storage custody solution held in a purpose-built physically-secure environment
based on established, industry best practices to safeguard our digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating
to hackers and technological attack. We believe that it may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of our bitcoin
holdings grow. To the extent that either BitGo Trust or we are unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, our digital
assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could adversely affect an investment in us. To the extent that
BitGo Trust is no longer, due to the current banking crisis, able to safeguard our assets, we would be at risk of loss if safeguarding
protocols fail.

Incorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency
transactions may be irreversible.

Cryptocurrency transactions
are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed or
fraudulent Bitcoin transactions could adversely affect Gryphon’s investments and assets. Cryptocurrency transactions are not, from
an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the cryptocurrency from the
transaction. In theory, Bitcoin transactions may be reversible with the control or consent of a majority of processing power on the Bitcoin
network; however, Gryphon does not now, nor is it feasible that Gryphon could in the future, possess sufficient processing power to effect
such a reversal. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of
a cryptocurrency or a theft thereof generally will not be reversible and Gryphon may not have sufficient recourse to recover its losses
from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft, fraud, phishing schemes or other
criminal action, Gryphon’s cryptocurrency rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or
uncontrolled accounts. Further, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative
or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency. In
the event of a loss, Gryphon would be reliant on existing private investigative entities to investigate any such loss of Gryphon’s
bitcoin assets. These third-party service providers rely on data analysis and compliance of Internet service providers with traditional
court orders to reveal information such as the IP addresses of any attackers who may have targeted Gryphon. To the extent that Gryphon
is unable to recover its losses from such action, error, theft or other criminal action, such events could have a material adverse effect
on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue Gryphon’s new strategy at all, which could have a material
adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines or
otherwise acquires or holds for its own account.

Gryphon may be affected by price fluctuations
in the wholesale and retail power markets.

Market prices for power,
generation capacity and ancillary services, are unpredictable. Depending upon the effectiveness of any price risk management activity
undertaken by Gryphon, including but not limited to attempts to secure hosting services contracts at fixed fees, an increase in market
prices for power, generation capacity, and ancillary services may adversely affect Gryphon’s business, prospects, financial condition,
and operating results. Long- and short-term power prices may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors outside of Gryphon’s
control, including, but not limited to:

●

increases and decreases in generation capacity;

●

changes in power transmission or fuel transportation
    capacity constraints or inefficiencies;

●

volatile weather conditions, particularly unusually
    hot or mild summers or unusually cold or warm winters;

●

technological shifts resulting in changes in the
    demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools, expansion and
    technological advancements in power storage capability and the development of new fuels or new technologies for the production or
    storage of power;

●

federal and state power, market and environmental
    regulation and legislation; and

●

changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.

25

If Gryphon is unable to secure and maintain
its power supply at prices or on terms acceptable to it, a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects, financial
condition, and operating results would occur.

To remain competitive in
Gryphon’s industry, Gryphon seeks to grow its hash rate to match the growing network hash rate and increasing network difficulty
of the Bitcoin blockchain, and if Gryphon is unable to grow its hash rate at pace with the network hash rate, Gryphon’s chance
of earning bitcoin from its mining operations would decline.

As the adoption of Bitcoin
has increased, the price of Bitcoin has generally appreciated, causing the demand for new bitcoin rewards for successfully solving blocks
on the Bitcoin blockchain to likewise increase. This has encouraged more miners to attempt to mine bitcoin, which increases the global
network hash rate deployed in support of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Because a miner’s relative
chance of successfully solving a block and earning a new bitcoin reward is generally a function of the ratio the miner’s individual
hash rate bears to the global network hash rate, as the global network hash rate increases, a miner must increase its individual hash
rate to maintain its chances of earning new bitcoin rewards. Therefore, as new miners enter the industry and as miners deploy greater
and greater numbers of increasingly powerful machines, existing miners must seek to continually increase their hash rates to remain competitive.
Thus, a feedback loop is created: as Bitcoin gains popularity and its relative market price increases, more miners attempt to mine bitcoin
and the Bitcoin network hash rate is increased; in response, existing miners and new miners devote more and more hash rate to the Bitcoin
blockchain by deploying greater numbers of increasingly powerful machines in an attempt to ensure their abilities to earn additional
bitcoin rewards do not decrease. Compounding this feedback loop, the network difficulty of the Bitcoin network (i.e., the amount of work
(measured in hashes) necessary to solve a block) is periodically adjusted to maintain the pace of new block additions (with one new block
added to the blockchain approximately every ten minutes), and thereby control the supply of Bitcoin. As miners deploy more hash rate
and the Bitcoin network hash rate is increased, the Bitcoin network difficulty is adjusted upwards by requiring more hash rate to be
deployed to solve a block. Thus, miners are further incentivized to grow their hash rates to maintain their chances of earning new bitcoin
rewards. In theory, these dual processes should continually replicate themselves until the supply of available bitcoin is exhausted.
In response, miners have attempted to achieve greater hash rates by deploying increasingly sophisticated and expensive miners in ever
greater quantities. This has become the Bitcoin mining industry’s great “arms race.” Moreover, because there are very
few manufacturers of miners capable of producing a sufficient number of miners of adequate quality to meet this need, scarcity results
and miner prices increase. Compounding this phenomenon, it has been observed that some manufacturers of bitcoin miners may increase their
prices for new miners as the market price of Bitcoin increases.

Accordingly, for Gryphon
to maintain its chances of earning new bitcoin rewards and remaining competitive in its industry, Gryphon must seek to continually add
new miners to grow its hash rate at pace with the growth in the Bitcoin network hash rate. However, as demand has increased and scarcity
in the supply of new miners has resulted, the price of new miners has increased, and Gryphon expects this process to continue in the
future as demand for bitcoin increases. Therefore, if the price of Bitcoin is not sufficiently high to allow Gryphon to fund its hash
rate growth through new miner acquisitions, and if Gryphon is otherwise unable to access additional capital to acquire these miners,
Gryphon’s hash rate may stagnate and Gryphon may fall behind its competitors. If this happens, Gryphon’s chances of earning
new bitcoin rewards would decline and, as such, its results of operations and financial condition may suffer.

26

Gryphon’s business is dependent on
a small number of digital asset mining equipment suppliers.

Gryphon’s business
is dependent upon digital asset mining equipment suppliers providing an adequate supply of new generation digital asset mining machines
at economical prices to customers intending to purchase its hosting and other solutions. The growth in Gryphon’s business is directly
related to increased demand for hosting services and digital assets such as Bitcoin, which is dependent in large part on the availability
of new generation mining machines offered for sale at a price conducive to profitable digital asset mining, as well as the trading price
of digital assets such as Bitcoin. The market price and availability of new mining machines fluctuates with the price of Bitcoin and
can be volatile. Higher Bitcoin prices increase the demand for mining equipment and increase the cost. In addition, as more companies
seek to enter the mining industry, the demand for machines may outpace supply and create mining machine equipment shortages. There are
no assurances that digital asset mining equipment suppliers will be able to keep pace with any surge in demand for mining equipment.
Further, manufacturing mining machine purchase contracts are not favorable to purchasers and Gryphon may have little or no recourse in
the event a mining machine manufacturer defaults on its mining machine delivery commitments. If Gryphon and its customers are not able
to obtain a sufficient number of digital asset mining machines at favorable prices, its growth expectations, liquidity, financial condition
and results of operations will be negatively impacted.

Mining machines rely on components and
raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages, including ASIC chips that have been subject to an ongoing significant
shortage.

In order to build and sustain
Gryphon’s self-mining operations, Gryphon will depend on third parties to provide it with ASIC chips and other critical components
for its mining equipment, which may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages. For example, the ASIC chip is the key component of
a mining machine as it determines the efficiency of the device. The production of ASIC chips typically requires highly sophisticated
silicon wafers, which currently only a small number of fabrication facilities, or wafer foundries, in the world are capable of producing.
ASIC chips were recently subject to significant price increases and shortages that may occur again in the future.

There is also a risk that
a manufacturer or seller of ASIC chips or other necessary mining equipment may adjust the prices according to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrency
prices or otherwise, so the cost of new machines could become unpredictable and extremely high. As a result, at times, Gryphon may be
forced to obtain mining machines and other hardware at premium prices, to the extent they are even available. Such events could have
a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.

Gryphon’s reliance primarily on a
single model of miner may subject its operations to increased risk of design flaws.

The performance and reliability
of Gryphon’s miners and its technology is critical to Gryphon’s reputation and its operations. Because Gryphon currently
only uses Bitmain Antminer type miners, if there are issues with those machines, such as a design flaw in the ASIC chips they employ,
Gryphon’s entire system could be affected. Any system error or failure may significantly delay response times or even cause Gryphon’s
system to fail. Any disruption in Gryphon’s ability to continue mining could result in lower yields and harm its reputation and
business. Any exploitable weakness, flaw, or error common to Bitmain miners could affect all of Gryphon’s miners; therefore, if
a defect or other flaw exists and is exploited, Gryphon’s entire miner fleet could be adversely impacted. Any interruption, delay
or system failure could result in financial losses, a decrease in the value of Gryphon’s stock and damage to Gryphon’s reputation.

There are risks related to technological
obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain to Bitcoin hardware disruption, and difficulty in obtaining new hardware,
which may have a negative effect on Gryphon’s business.

Gryphon’s mining operations
can only be successful and profitable if the costs of mining Bitcoin, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with mining
Bitcoin are lower than the price of a bitcoin. As Gryphon’s mining facility operates, Gryphon’s miners experience ordinary
wear and tear, and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond Gryphon’s control.
The physical degradation of Gryphon’s miners will require Gryphon to, over time, replace those miners which are no longer functional.
Additionally, as the technology evolves, Gryphon may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market.
Also, because Gryphon expects to depreciate all new miners, Gryphon’s reported operating results will be negatively affected.

27

Gryphon’s use of third-party mining
pools exposes it to additional risks.

Gryphon receives bitcoin
rewards from its mining activity through a third-party mining pool operator. Mining pools allow miners to combine their processing power,
which increases miners’ chances of solving blocks and receiving bitcoin rewards from the network. The rewards are distributed by
the pool operator, proportionally to Gryphon’s contribution to the pool’s overall mining power, after deducting the applicable
pool fee, if any, used to solve a particular block on the Bitcoin blockchain. Should the pool operator’s system suffer downtime
due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other issue, Gryphon’s ability to mine and receive revenue will be negatively impacted.

Gryphon relies on hosting arrangements
to conduct its business, and the availability of such hosting arrangements is uncertain and competitive and may be affected by changes
in regulation in one or more countries.

Gryphon relies on its hosting
arrangements with Blockfusion and Mawson, to provide mining data centers and host its mining equipment. If these mining data centers
fail to perform their obligations under their agreements with Gryphon, Gryphon may be forced to look for alternative mining data centers
to host its mining equipment, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, if the mining data centers shut
down or cannot accommodate additional miners as Gryphon expands its fleet, Gryphon may be forced to look for alternative centers.

In May 2021, China’s
State Council issued a statement signaling its intent to restrict cryptocurrency mining and trading activities, resulting in provincial
governments taking proactive measurements to prohibit cryptocurrency mining. On September 24, 2021, China’s central bank and its
National Development and Reform Commission issued a nation-wide ban on cryptocurrency mining and declaring all financial transactions
involving cryptocurrencies illegal. As a result, mining data centers previously operating in China have been forced to shut down and
owners of cryptocurrency mining equipment located in China have been attempting to relocate the equipment to mining data centers in other
jurisdictions, with a particular focus on locations within the United States. Combined with the increase in the price of bitcoin in 2021,
the influx of cryptocurrency miners from China has created conditions of great demand for mining data centers and limited supply. Due
to these conditions, there is no assurance that Gryphon will be able to procure alternative hosting agreements on acceptable terms in
a timely manner or at all.

Significant competition for
suitable mining data centers is expected to continue, and other government regulators, including local permitting officials, may potentially
restrict the ability of potential mining data centers to begin or continue operations in certain locations. They can also restrict the
ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage, or may otherwise potentially
restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to mining operations. While Gryphon is not aware of the existence of any such restrictions
in New York and Pennsylvania, the jurisdictions   in which the mining data centers that Gryphon is currently maintaining its
machines at are located, new ordinances and other regulations at the federal, state and local levels can be introduced at any time and
can be triggered by certain adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, among other reasons.

The mining data centers at which Gryphon
maintains its mining equipment may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance.

Gryphon maintains its mining
equipment at mining data centers in New York and Pennsylvania. The mining data centers at which Gryphon maintains its mining equipment,
and any future mining data centers at which Gryphon maintains its mining equipment will be, subject to a variety of risks relating to
physical condition and operation, including:

●

the presence of construction or repair defects or other structural
    or building damage;

●

any non-compliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental,
    health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;

●

any damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes,
    fires, floods and windstorms; and

●

claims by employees and others for injuries sustained at Gryphon’s
    properties.

28

For example, the mining data
centers at which Gryphon maintains its mining equipment could be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire
or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other attack on the facilities where Gryphon’s mining equipment is located. The
security and other measures Gryphon takes to protect against these risks may not be sufficient. Any property insurance Gryphon obtained
in the future may not be adequate to cover the losses Gryphon suffers as a result of any of these events. In the event of an uninsured
loss, including a loss in excess of insured limits, at any of the mining data centers at which Gryphon maintains its mining equipment,
such mining data centers may not be adequately repaired in a timely manner or at all and Gryphon may lose some or all of the future revenues
anticipated to be derived from Gryphon’s equipment located at such mining data centers. Additionally, Gryphon is exposed to regulatory
risk in New York and Pennsylvania  . The recent regulatory changes in New York have not impacted Gryphon’s operations
due the scope of the changes being limited to carbon-based electricity. However, Gryphon is acutely aware that further regulatory changes
could impact its ability to operate in the state and is prepared to shift its operations to alternative jurisdictions should it be required.
Such a shift could be costly, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Gryphon may not be able to compete with
other companies, some of whom have greater resources and experience.

Gryphon may not be able to
compete successfully against present or future competitors. Gryphon does not have the resources to compete with larger providers of similar
services at this time. The AI, HPC and Bitcoin industries have attracted various high-profile and well-established operators, some of
which have substantially greater liquidity and financial resources than Gryphon does. With the limited resources Gryphon has available,
Gryphon may experience great difficulties in establishing itself in the AI and HPC industries and expanding and improving its network
of computers to remain competitive. Competition from existing and future competitors, particularly those that have access to competitively-priced
energy, could result in Gryphon’s inability to secure acquisitions and partnerships that Gryphon may need to expand Gryphon’s
business in the future. This competition from other entities with greater resources, experience and reputations may result in Gryphon’s
failure to maintain or expand its business, as Gryphon may never be able to successfully execute its business plan. If Gryphon is unable
to expand and remain competitive, its business could be negatively affected.

Gryphon’s operations, investment
strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in Bitcoin.

Gryphon competes with other
users and/or companies that are mining Bitcoin and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to Bitcoin
through entities similar to Gryphon. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond Gryphon’s control, may make it
more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in Bitcoin directly. The emergence of other financial vehicles and
exchange-traded funds have been scrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative impressions or conclusions resulting from
such scrutiny could be applicable to Gryphon and impact Gryphon’s ability to successfully pursue its strategy or operate at all,
or to establish or maintain a public market for Gryphon’s securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on
Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue its strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on
Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or
holds for its own account, and harm investors.

The development and acceptance of competing
blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives.

The development and acceptance
of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or an alternative to distributed
ledgers altogether. Gryphon’s business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and Gryphon could face difficulty
adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect Gryphon and Gryphon’s exposure
to various blockchain technologies and prevent Gryphon from realizing the anticipated profits from its investments. Such circumstances
could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue Gryphon’s strategy
at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin
that Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or holds for Gryphon’s own account, which could in turn harm investors.

29

Gryphon may not adequately respond to price
fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect Gryphon’s business.

Competitive conditions within
the AI, HPC and Bitcoin industries require that Gryphon use sophisticated technology in the operation of Gryphon’s business. The
industry for blockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements and evolving
industry standards. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better performance than the software and other
technologies Gryphon currently utilizes, and Gryphon may have to manage transitions to these new technologies to remain competitive.
Gryphon may not be successful, generally or relative to Gryphon’s competitors in the AI, HPC and Bitcoin industries, in timely
implementing new technology into Gryphon’s systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. During the course of implementing any
such new technology into Gryphon’s operations, Gryphon may experience system interruptions and failures during such implementation.
Furthermore, there can be no assurances that Gryphon will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that Gryphon may expect
as a result of implementing new technology into its operations. As a result, Gryphon’s business and operations may suffer.

There is a possibility of Bitcoin mining
algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make Gryphon less competitive and ultimately
adversely affect Gryphon’s business.

Proof of stake is an alternative
method in validating Bitcoin transactions. Should the algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a proof of stake method,
mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from lower
priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. Gryphon, as a result of its efforts to optimize and improve
the efficiency of its bitcoin mining operations, may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of Gryphon’s capital
investments and the competitive advantage Gryphon hopes to gain from this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to
proof of stake validation were to occur. Such events could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a
going concern or to pursue its new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects
or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin that Gryphon mines or otherwise acquires or holds for its own account.

Gryphon may not be able to realize the
benefits of forks. Forks in a digital asset network may occur in the future which may affect the value of bitcoin held by Gryphon.

To the extent that a significant
majority of users and miners on a cryptocurrency network install software that changes the cryptocurrency network or properties of a
cryptocurrency, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency
network would be subject to new protocols and software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the cryptocurrency
network consent to the proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the
consequence would be what is known as a “fork” of the network, with one prong running the pre-modified software and the other
running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of the cryptocurrency running in parallel,
yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transactions to convert currencies between the two forks. Additionally,
it may be unclear following a fork which fork represents the original asset and which is the new asset. Different metrics adopted by
industry participants to determine which is the original asset include: referring to the wishes of the core developers of a cryptocurrency,
blockchains with the greatest amount of hashing power contributed by miners or validators, or blockchains with the longest chain. A fork
in the Bitcoin network could adversely affect Gryphon’s ability to operate.

Gryphon may not be able to
realize the economic benefit of a fork, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect Gryphon’s business. If Gryphon
holds bitcoin at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that Gryphon would be expected to
hold an equivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, Gryphon may not be able, or it may not be practical,
to secure or realize the economic benefit of the new asset for various reasons. For instance, Gryphon may determine that there is no
safe or practical way to custody the new asset, that trying to do so may pose an unacceptable risk to Gryphon’s holdings in the
old asset, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the new cryptocurrency exceed the benefits of owning
the new cryptocurrency. Additionally, laws, regulations or other factors may prevent Gryphon from benefitting from the new asset even
if there is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the new asset.

30

The impacts of climate change may result
in additional costs or risks.

The physical risks of climate
change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, demand for AI, HPC, Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies, and other operating costs. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed
or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on Gryphon’s operations, or if Gryphon’s
operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, Gryphon’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations,
financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.

Terminations of agreements with hosting
partners may materially our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

On October 31, 2024, we terminated
our hosting agreement with Coinmint, with effect on January 1, 2025. On December 1, 2024, we entered into the Blockfusion Agreement with
Blockfusion for hosting 3,780 of our bitcoin miners at Blockfusion’s facility in Niagara Falls, New York. The Blockfusion Agreement
has a term of twelve months and automatically renews for subsequent one-month terms until terminated on thirty days’ notice. Additionally,
on January 3, 2025, we entered into the Mawson Agreement with Mawson for hosting the remaining 635 of our bitcoin miners at Mawson’s
facility in Midland, Pennsylvania, with the right to host up to 5,880 miners. The Mawson Agreement has an initial term of one year and
may be terminated on sixty days’ notice.

The termination of agreements
with hosting partners exposes us to numerous risks, including the potential for a decline in our market position, reduced operational
efficiency, and the likelihood of increased operational costs if we are required to secure emergency or short-term hosting solutions
at unfavorable terms. In addition, we may need to devote significant resources to identify and secure a new hosting arrangement. There
can be no assurance that we will find a suitable or economically viable replacement in a timely manner, if at all, in the event of a
termination.

Restrictive covenants in the New Loan Agreement
and Notes may limit our operating flexibility and ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in our long-term best interest.

The New Loan Agreement and
the Notes contain certain covenants that limit Gryphon’s ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in Gryphon’s
long-term best interest. Subject to certain limited exceptions, these covenants do or may limit Gryphon’s ability to or prohibit
Gryphon from permitting any of its subsidiaries to, as applicable, among other things:

●

make any conveyance, sale, lease, division, sale and leaseback, assignment,
    transfer or other disposition of assets, subject to certain exceptions;

●

create, incur, assume, or be liable for any additional indebtedness,
    or create, incur, allow, or permit to exist any additional liens, subject to certain exceptions;

●

make any dividend or other distribution on Gryphon shares, or any payment
    (whether in cash, securities or other property) on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement, acquisition, cancellation or
    termination of any Gryphon shares, or on account of any return of capital to Gryphon’s shareholders in respect of their shares;
    or

●

merge or consolidate with another entity.

31

While Gryphon has not previously
breached and is currently in compliance with the covenants contained in the New Loan Agreement and Notes, Gryphon may breach these covenants
in the future. Gryphon’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events and factors beyond its control. In the
event that Gryphon breaches one or more covenants, Anchorage or the holders of the Notes, as applicable, may choose to declare an event
of default and require that Gryphon immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the New Loan Agreement or the Notes, as applicable,
and terminate any commitment to extend further credit and foreclose on collateral. The occurrence of any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and
Enforcement

As cryptocurrencies may be determined to
be investment securities, Gryphon may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and incur large losses as a result and
potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and Gryphon may incur third-party liabilities.

Gryphon believes that it
is not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and it does not hold itself out as being engaged
in those activities. However, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), a company may be deemed
an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of its total assets
(exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.

As a result of Gryphon’s
investments and its mining activities, including investments in which it does not have a controlling interest, the investment securities
Gryphon holds could exceed 40% of Gryphon’s total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, Gryphon could determine that
it has become an inadvertent investment company. The bitcoin that Gryphon owns, acquires or mines may be deemed an investment security
by the SEC, although Gryphon does not believe any of the bitcoin it owns, acquires or mines are securities. An inadvertent investment
company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act.
One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from
the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer’s total assets
on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities
having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on
an unconsolidated basis. As of the date of this Report, Gryphon does not believe it is an inadvertent investment company. Gryphon may
take actions to cause the investment securities held by it to be less than 40% of its total assets, which may include acquiring assets
with Gryphon’s cash and bitcoin on hand or liquidating Gryphon’s investment securities or bitcoin or seeking a no-action
letter from the SEC if Gryphon is unable to acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.

As the Rule 3a-2 exception
is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to Gryphon, Gryphon would
have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after it ceases being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit Gryphon’s
ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on Gryphon’s earnings.
In any event, Gryphon does not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.

Classification as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have
to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would
require a restructuring of Gryphon’s operations, and Gryphon would be very constrained in the kind of business it could do as a
registered investment company. Further, Gryphon would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions
with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of
such compliance would result in Gryphon incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have
a materially adverse impact to conduct Gryphon’s operations.

If regulatory changes or interpretations
of Gryphon’s activities require its registration as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by The Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, Gryphon may be required to register and comply with such
regulations. If regulatory changes or interpretations of Gryphon’s activities require the licensing or other registration of Gryphon
as a money transmitter (or equivalent designation) under state law in any state in which Gryphon operates, Gryphon may be required to
seek licensure or otherwise register and comply with such state law. In the event of any such requirement, to the extent Gryphon decides
to continue, the required registrations, licensure and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses
to Gryphon. Gryphon may also decide to cease its operations. Any termination of certain operations in response to the changed regulatory
circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors.

To the extent that Gryphon’s
activities cause it to be deemed a money service business under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
of the U.S. Treasury Department (“FinCEN”) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, Gryphon may be required to comply
with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate Gryphon to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports
to FinCEN and maintain certain records.

32

To the extent that Gryphon’s
activities cause Gryphon to be deemed a money transmitter or equivalent designation under state law in any state in which Gryphon operates,
Gryphon may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include
the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the
New York Department of Financial Services maintains a comprehensive “BitLicense” framework for businesses that conduct “virtual
currency business activity.” Gryphon will continue to monitor for developments in New York legislation, guidance and regulations.

Such additional federal or
state regulatory obligations may cause Gryphon to incur extraordinary expenses, which could affect Gryphon’s business in a material
and adverse manner. Furthermore, Gryphon and its service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory
obligations applicable to money service businesses and money transmitters. If Gryphon is deemed to be subject to and determined not to
comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, Gryphon may act to dissolve and liquidate Gryphon. Any such action
may adversely affect an investment in Gryphon.

Gryphon is subject to an extensive, highly
evolving and uncertain regulatory and business landscape and any adverse changes to, or its failure to comply with, any laws and regulations,
and adverse business reactions from counterparties could adversely affect its brand, reputation, business, operating results, and financial
condition.

Gryphon’s business
is subject to extensive laws, rules, regulations, policies, orders, determinations, directives, treaties, and legal and regulatory interpretations
and guidance, as well as counterparty risk in the markets in which it operates, including regulatory aspects from financial services,
federal energy and other regulators, the SEC, the CFTC, credit, crypto asset custody, exchange, and transfer, cross-border and domestic
money and crypto asset transmission, consumer and commercial lending, usury, foreign currency exchange, privacy, data governance, data
protection, cybersecurity, fraud detection, antitrust and competition, bankruptcy, tax, anti-bribery, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money
laundering, and counter-terrorist financing, as well as the same regulatory risks applicable to counterparties, most notably hosting
businesses, as well as the recent economic issues and bankruptcies befalling some in this industry. Many of these legal and regulatory
regimes were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile technologies, crypto assets, and related technologies. As a result,
some applicable laws and regulations do not contemplate or address unique issues associated with the crypto economy, are subject to significant
uncertainty, and vary widely across U.S. federal, state, and local and international jurisdictions. These legal and regulatory regimes,
including the laws, rules, and regulations thereunder, evolve frequently and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent
manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another. Moreover, the complexity and evolving nature of Gryphon’s
business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the crypto economy requires Gryphon to exercise its judgment as
to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and regulators may disagree
with Gryphon’s conclusions. To the extent Gryphon has not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, it could be subject
to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on its products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences,
each of which may be significant and could adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.

Additionally, various governmental
and regulatory bodies, including legislative and executive bodies, in the United States and in other countries may adopt new laws and
regulations, the direction and timing of which may be influenced by changes in the governing administrations and major events in the
crypto economy. The collapse of TerraUSD and Luna and the bankruptcy filings of FTX and its subsidiaries, Three Arrows, Celsius, Voyager,
Genesis and BlockFi have resulted in calls for heightened scrutiny and regulation of the digital asset industry, with a specific focus
on digital asset exchanges, platforms, and custodians. Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies are expected to introduce
and enact new laws and regulations to regulate digital asset intermediaries, such as digital asset exchanges and custodians. The U.S.
regulatory regime - namely the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the SEC, the CFTC, FinCEN, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation)
as well as the White House have issued reports and releases concerning digital assets, including Bitcoin and digital asset markets. In
the near future, various governmental and regulatory bodies, including in the United States, may introduce new policies, laws, and regulations
relating to crypto assets and the crypto economy generally, and crypto asset platforms in particular. However, the extent and content
of any forthcoming laws and regulations are not yet ascertainable with certainty, and it may not be ascertainable in the near future.
The failures of risk management and other control functions at other companies that played a role in these events could accelerate an
existing regulatory trend toward stricter oversight of crypto asset platforms and the crypto economy.

33

Although Gryphon is not directly
connected to the recent cryptocurrency market events, Gryphon may still suffer reputational harm due to its association with the cryptocurrency
industry in light of the recent disruption in the crypto asset markets. Due to its business activities, Gryphon may be subject to ongoing
examinations, oversight, and reviews and currently are, and expect in the future, to be subject to investigations and inquiries, by U.S.
federal and state regulators, many of which have broad discretion to audit and examine its business. Moreover, new laws, regulations,
or interpretations may result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions, including preventing
or delaying Gryphon from offering certain products or services offered by its competitors or could impact how it offers such products
and services. Adverse changes to, or its failure to comply with, any laws and regulations have had, and may continue to have, an adverse
effect on its reputation and brand and its business, operating results, and financial condition.

There is no one unifying principle governing
the regulatory status of cryptocurrency nor whether cryptocurrency is a security in each context in which it is viewed. Regulatory changes
or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature of an investment in Gryphon or restrict the use of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies,
in a manner that adversely affects Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations.

As cryptocurrencies have
grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrencies
illegal, and others allowing their use and trade without restriction. In some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., digital assets, like
cryptocurrencies, are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. On March 8,
2022, President Biden announced an executive order on cryptocurrencies, which seeks to establish a unified federal regulatory regime
for cryptocurrencies. In connection with FTX’s collapse and bankruptcy filing, the U.S. Department of Justice brought criminal
charges, including charges of fraud, violations of federal securities laws, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses against FTX’s
former CEO and others. FTX is also under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
as well as by various regulatory authorities in the Bahamas, Europe and other jurisdictions. Regulatory and enforcement scrutiny has
also increased, including from the DOJ, the SEC, the CFTC, the White House and Congress. Gryphon is unable to predict the nature or extent
of new and proposed legislation and regulation potentially stemming from the Biden Administration executive order and proceedings surrounding
FTX.

Bitcoin is the oldest and
most well-known form of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrencies have been the source of much regulatory consternation,
resulting in differing definitional outcomes without a single unifying statement. Bitcoin and other digital assets are viewed differently
by different regulatory and standards setting organizations globally as well as in the United States on the federal and state levels.
For example, the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) and the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) consider a cryptocurrency
as currency or an asset or property. Further, the IRS applies general tax principles that apply to property transactions to transactions
involving virtual currency.

If regulatory changes or
interpretations require the regulation of Bitcoin or other digital assets under the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere,
including the Securities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by
the SEC, the CFTC, the IRS, Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, Gryphon may be required to register and comply with
such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent that Gryphon decides to continue operations, the required registrations
and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expense or burdens to Gryphon. Gryphon may also decide to cease certain operations
and change Gryphon’s business model. Any disruption of Gryphon’s operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances
may be at a time that is disadvantageous to Gryphon.

34

Current and future legislation
and SEC-rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner
in which Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies may not be excluded from the definition of “security” by SEC rulemaking or interpretation requiring
registration of all transactions unless another exemption is available, including transacting in bitcoin or cryptocurrency among owners
and require registration of trading platforms as “exchanges.”

Gryphon cannot be certain
as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under the law. While Gryphon
received crypto assets other than Bitcoin from the private placement of stock, Gryphon has long since sold these assets and currently
does not hold any crypto assets other than Bitcoin. Additionally, Gryphon does not intend to expand its business by acquiring digital
assets other than Bitcoin. Nonetheless, if Bitcoin becomes subject to additional regulatory and registration requirements, and Gryphon
fails to comply with these, Gryphon may seek to cease certain of its operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental
action. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue
its business model at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects or operations and potentially the value
of any cryptocurrencies Gryphon plans to hold or expect to acquire for its own account.

Banks and financial institutions may not
provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in Bitcoin-related activities or that accept bitcoin as
payment, including financial institutions of investors in Gryphon’s common stock.

A number of companies that
engage in Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing
to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with
Bitcoin may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions
in response to government action, particularly in China, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use
for ordinary consumer transactions within China. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued a joint statement effectively discouraging banks from doing business with clients in crypto-asset
industries. The Federal Reserve also issued a policy statement broadening its authority to cover state-chartered institutions. Moreover,
in January 2023, the White House issued a statement cautioning deepening ties between crypto-assets and the broader financial system.
Gryphon also may be unable to obtain or maintain these financial services for Gryphon’s business. The difficulty that many businesses
that provide Bitcoin and/or derivatives on other cryptocurrency-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and
financial institutions willing to provide them services could decrease their usefulness and harm their public perception in the future
and may be decreasing the usefulness of Bitcoin as a payment system and harming public perception of Bitcoin.

The usefulness of Bitcoin
as a payment system and the public perception of Bitcoin could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the accounts
of businesses engaging in Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities. This could occur as a result of compliance risk, cost,
government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock exchanges
and commodities derivatives exchanges, the over-the-counter market, and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities
adopts or implements similar policies, rules or regulations, could negatively affect Gryphon’s relationships with financial institutions
and impede Gryphon’s ability to convert bitcoin to fiat currencies. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s
ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue its strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Gryphon’s
business, prospects or operations and harm investors.

35

It may be illegal now, or in the future,
to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin, ether, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency
assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect Gryphon.

As Bitcoin has grown in both
popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to Bitcoin; certain governments have deemed them illegal,
and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., subject to extensive,
and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Until recently, little or no regulatory attention has been
directed toward Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies.
As Bitcoin has grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the operations of
the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin users and the Bitcoin exchange market.

One or more countries such
as China and Russia, which have taken harsh regulatory action in the past, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely
restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use these cryptocurrency assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations,
particularly in China and Russia, it is illegal to accept payment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and
banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of Bitcoin. Such restrictions may adversely affect Gryphon as the large-scale
use of Bitcoin as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse
effect on Gryphon’s ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue Gryphon’s strategy at all, which could have a material
adverse effect on Gryphon’s business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin that Gryphon mines or otherwise
acquires or holds for its own account, and harm investors.

Gryphon’s interactions with a blockchain
may expose Gryphon to specially designated nationals or blocked persons or cause Gryphon to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate
distributed ledger technology.

The Office of Financial Assets
Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (“OFAC”) requires Gryphon to comply with its sanction program and not conduct
business with persons named on its specially designated nationals list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions,
Gryphon may inadvertently and without Gryphon’s knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s specially designated
nationals list. Gryphon’s policy prohibits any transactions with such specially designated national individuals, but Gryphon may
not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom Gryphon transacts with respect to selling
bitcoin assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any U.S. person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual depiction commonly
known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more blockchains.
Because Gryphon’s business requires it to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate Gryphon’s ongoing business,
it is possible that such digital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without Gryphon’s knowledge or consent. To the extent government
enforcement authorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger
technology, Gryphon may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties,
all of which could harm Gryphon’s reputation.

Increased scrutiny and changing expectations
from stockholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and the impacts of climate change
may result in additional costs or risks.

Companies across many industries
are facing increasing scrutiny related to their ESG practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment
funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance
on the non-financial impacts of their investments. Conversely, so-called “anti-ESG” and “anti-DEI” sentiment
has also gained momentum across the United States, with several state and federal authorities having enacted or proposed “anti-ESG”
policies or legislation, issued executive orders and legal opinions and engaged in related investigations and litigation. If our policies
or practices are viewed as being in contradiction of such “anti-ESG” or “anti-DEI” policies, legislation executive
orders or legal opinions, our reputation may be harmed and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.

36

The SEC adopted a rule that
requires climate disclosures in periodic and other filings with the SEC covering fiscal years beginning in 2025, which rule has been
stayed pending the completion of a judicial review. To comply with this SEC rule, if the rule goes into effect in its current form, we
will be required to establish additional internal controls, engage additional consultants and incur additional costs related to evaluating,
managing and reporting on our environmental impact and climate-related risks and opportunities. If we fail to implement sufficient oversight
or accurately capture and disclose on environmental matters, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition may
be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global
climate change, may result in increased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management team may divert significant
time and energy away from our operations and towards responding to such scrutiny.

In addition, the physical
risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supplies of energy, and
demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to
repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather
events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions
and compliance requirements on our operations, or if our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, our business,
capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.  

 Targeted energy regulations and taxes
could increase our costs and adversely affect our business.

Bitcoin mining requires significant
energy consumption, and our operations could be negatively impacted by government regulations or taxes specifically targeting energy
usage in digital asset mining. Federal, state or local authorities may impose restrictions on energy consumption, mandate the use of
renewable energy sources or implement higher electricity rates for mining operations, increasing our operating costs. Additionally, governments
may introduce taxes on energy usage or carbon emissions that disproportionately affect bitcoin miners, further reducing our profitability.
If regulatory or tax burdens make mining economically unviable in certain jurisdictions, we may be forced to relocate operations, secure
alternative power sources at higher costs or scale back our mining activities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Gryphon’s management and compliance
personnel have limited experience handling a listed cryptocurrency mining-related services company.

Gryphon’s management
and compliance personnel have limited experience in handling regulatory and compliance matters relating to a listed cryptocurrency mining-related
services company. Gryphon’s key compliance documents and compliance programs, such as AML and KYC procedures, also have a recent
history only. Gryphon believes that its measures designed to limit its counterparty risks are appropriate. While Gryphon has been devoting
a substantial amount of time and resources to various compliance initiatives and risk management measures, including but not limited
to, developing a dedicated internal compliance function, Gryphon cannot assure you the practical application and effectiveness of its
compliance program and risk management measures, nor that there will not be a failure in detecting regulatory compliance issues or managing
risk exposure, which may adversely affect its reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations

Risks Related to Pending Acquisitions

If completed, the Captus Acquisition may not achieve its intended
results and may result in us assuming unanticipated liabilities.

We entered into the Captus
Agreement with the expectation that the Captus Acquisition would result in various benefits and growth opportunities. Achieving the anticipated
benefits of the transaction is subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties, including our ability to raise the substantial capital
required to begin operations at the site and risks related to construction, contracting, insurance, management, community, environmental,
operations, foreign relations and others highlighted in this 
Risk Factors
 section.   . Additionally, the success of
the Captus Acquisition depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our assessment of the assets associated with the acquired properties,
operating costs and various other factors. These assessments are necessarily inexact. As a result, we may not recover the purchase price
for the acquisition or recognize an acceptable return on sales. 

The transactions contemplated by the Captus
Agreement are subject to conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis or at all. Failure to complete the transactions contemplated
by the Captus Agreement could have material and adverse effects on us.

Completion of the Captus Acquisition is subject
to a number of conditions, including the accuracy of the parties’ representations in the Captus Agreement and the receipt of certain
governmental approvals. Such conditions, some of which are beyond our control, may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at
all and therefore make the completion and timing of the completion of the Captus Acquisition uncertain. In addition, the Captus Agreement
contains certain termination rights for both the Vendors and us, which if exercised will also result in the Captus Acquisition not being
consummated. Furthermore, the governmental authorities from which regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion
of the Captus Acquisition or require changes to the terms of the acquisition or the Captus Agreement.

If the transactions contemplated by the Captus
Agreement are not completed, our business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the
Captus Acquisition, we will be required to pay our costs relating to the Captus Acquisition, such as legal, accounting, and financial
advisory fees. In addition, time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Captus Acquisition could otherwise
have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and the market price of our common stock could be impacted to the extent
that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Captus Acquisition will be completed.

We will be subject to business uncertainties while the Captus
Acquisition is pending, which could adversely affect our business.

It is possible that certain persons with whom
we have a business relationship may delay certain business decisions relating to us, or seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their
relationships with us, in connection with the pendency of the Captus Acquisition. This could negatively affect our revenues, earnings
and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Captus Acquisition is completed.

We expect to incur significant transaction costs in connection
with the Captus Acquisition.

We expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs
associated with negotiating and completing the Captus Acquisition. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial
and, in many cases, will be borne by us whether or not the Captus Acquisition is completed. A substantial majority of our non-recurring
expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the Captus Acquisition and include, among others, fees paid to financial, legal,
accounting and other advisors. We will continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and we may incur additional unanticipated costs.
The costs described above and any unanticipated costs and expenses, many of which will be borne by us even if the Captus Acquisition
is not completed, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.

Risks Related to Gryphon’s Securities

Our stock price is volatile and subject
to significant fluctuations.

The market price of our common
stock is highly volatile and may fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control, including:

●
changes
                                            in our industry, particularly those affecting bitcoin and other digital assets;

●
variability in bitcoin pricing;

●
competitive pricing pressures;

●
our ability to obtain working capital
                                            financing, including the closing of the Captus Acquisition;

●
additions or departures of key personnel;

●
sales of our common stock;

38

●
our ability to execute our business
                                            plan effectively;

●
operating results that fall below
                                            expectations;

●
loss of strategic relationships;

●
regulatory developments; and

●
broader economic and external factors.

Additionally, securities
markets have historically experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations unrelated to specific companies’ performance. Such
market fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

The stock price of the Company’s
common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of its operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares at
or above the purchase price.

An active trading market
for Gryphon’s common stock may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the
time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair Gryphon’s ability to
raise capital by selling shares of common stock and may impair Gryphon’s ability to acquire other businesses or technologies using
Gryphon’s shares of common stock as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect Gryphon’s business.
The market price of Gryphon’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond
Gryphon’s control, including:

●

overall performance of the equity markets;

●

Gryphon’s operating performance and the performance of other
    similar companies;

●

the published opinions and third-party valuations by banking and market
    analysts;

●

changes in Gryphon’s projected operating results that it provides
    to the public, Gryphon’s failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect
    to follow Gryphon’s common stock;

●

regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;

●

the level of expenses related to operations;

●

Gryphon’s failure to achieve its goals in the timeframe it announces;

●

announcements of acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements
    by Gryphon;

●

recruitment or departure of key personnel;

●

the economy as a whole and market conditions in Gryphon’s industry;

●

trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially
    own a majority of Gryphon’s outstanding common stock;

●

the size of Gryphon’s market float;

●

political uncertainty and/or instability in the United States;

●

the ongoing and future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions
    taken to slow its spread; and

●

any other factors discussed in this Report.

39

In addition, the equity markets
have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities
of many data mining and cryptocurrency companies. Stock prices of many data mining and cryptocurrency companies have fluctuated in a
manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The trading prices for common stock of other cryptocurrency
mining companies have also been highly volatile. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods
of market volatility. If Gryphon were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject Gryphon to substantial costs, divert
resources and the attention of management from Gryphon’s business and adversely affect its business.

Gryphon’s operating results may fluctuate
significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause the Company’s stock
price to fluctuate or decline.

Gryphon’s operating
results will be subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations. Gryphon’s net income and other operating results will be affected
by numerous factors, including:

●

Gryphon’s execution of any additional collaboration
    or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments Gryphon may make or receive under existing or future arrangements or the termination
    or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;

●

additions and departures of key personnel;

●

strategic decisions by Gryphon or its competitors,
    such as acquisitions, including the Captus Acquisition,  divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes
    in business strategy; and

●

changes in general market and economic conditions.

If Gryphon’s operating
results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of Gryphon’s common stock could decline substantially.
Furthermore, any fluctuations in Gryphon’s operating results may, in turn, cause the price of its stock to fluctuate substantially.

Gryphon’s executive officers, directors
and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, will continue to control or significantly influence all matters submitted
to stockholders for approval.

As of March 31, 2025, Gryphon’s executive officers, directors
and greater than 5% stockholders owned, in the aggregate, approximately 25.11% of the combined company’s outstanding common stock
(assuming no exercise of outstanding warrants). As a result, such persons acting together, have the ability to control or significantly
influence all matters submitted to Gryphon’s board of directors or stockholders for approval, including the appointment of Gryphon’s
management, the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction, as well as Gryphon’s management and
business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding
a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving Gryphon, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a
tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Gryphon’s business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.

Current or future litigation may harm our
financial condition or results of operations.

As described in the section
entitled “
Gryphon’s Business - Legal Proceedings
” in this Report, Gryphon is engaged in litigation, and such
proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages. Such current
or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
cash flows and reputation.

We have received a civil investigative
demand from the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a notice from the Small Business Administration (the
“SBA”) relating to our PPP Loan under the CARES Act related to COVID-19, that the DOJ is reviewing documents related to the
PPP Loan and the SBA is reviewing their prior decision to forgive our PPP Loan and may reverse that determination, and a reversal of
the determination that we are eligible for forgiveness of the PPP Loan could negatively impact the Company.

On April 21, 2020, the Company,
while operating the business of Akerna, obtained a loan from KeyBank National Association (“Key Bank”) in the principal aggregate
amount of $2.2 million (the “PPP Loan”) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. The PPP Loan had
a two-year term bearing interest at a rate of 1% per annum with principal and interest payments to be paid monthly beginning seven months
from the date of the PPP Loan. In August 2021, the Company submitted its application for forgiveness for repayment of the PPP Loan, and
on September 3, 2021, repayment of the PPP Loan was forgiven, in full, by the SBA.

40

On February 5, 2024, the
Company received a letter, dated January 25, 2024, from the SBA, on behalf of Key Bank, in which the SBA indicated that, notwithstanding
its prior notification of forgiveness, in full, of repayment of the PPP Loan, it was reviewing its prior determination of forgiveness
for potential reversal. Specifically, the SBA indicated that based on its preliminary findings, the SBA is considering a full denial
of the previously received forgiven amount based on the purported ineligibility of the Company to have received the PPP Loan under the
SBA loan programs because the Company, operating the business of Akerna at the time of the PPP Loan, provided software support to the
cannabis industry. The Company responded to the SBA on February 6, 2024, providing reasons as to why it believes it was eligible for
the PPP Loan, but has not received any further correspondence from the SBA, since that date, and the SBA has not made any financial demands.
The Company plans to continue to cooperate with any further inquiry from the SBA.

In January 2024, the Company
received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking information and documents about the PPP Loan. The Company is cooperating with
the inquiry. At this time, there has been no formal demand for return of the PPP Loan proceeds, and no formal claim or lawsuit has been
initiated against the Company.

While no formal determination
has been made regarding the SBA review of forgiveness of the PPP Loan, there currently exists a risk that the SBA or the DOJ could determine
that we do not qualify in whole or in part for such forgiveness and demand repayment of the PPP Loan. In addition, it is unknown what
type of penalties could be assessed against us, if any. Any obligation for us to repay the PPP Loan and any penalties in addition to
such repayment could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.

The issuance of shares of our common stock
pursuant to the New Loan Agreement, Notes and Advisory Agreement may result in significant dilution to our stockholders.

In addition to the Note Warrants,
the Notes are convertible into shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.21 per share, subject to adjustments. Under the Advisory Agreement,
in addition to the Advisory Warrants, within ten days of the closing of the Captus Acquisition, we will be required to issue the Advisor
six million shares of Common Stock, Finally, in addition to the Anchorage Warrants, the New Loan Agreement includes a conversion provision
whereby Anchorage may convert half of the outstanding principal at a price of $1.10 per share of Common Stock and the remaining half at
a price of $1.50 per share of Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that
such sales could occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock and may make it more difficult for you
to sell your securities at a time and price which you deem appropriate.

Sales of a substantial number of shares
of Gryphon’s common stock by Gryphon’s stockholders in the public market could cause Gryphon’s stock price to fall.

Sales of a substantial number
of shares of Gryphon’s common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could significantly reduce
the market price of Gryphon’s common stock and impair Gryphon’s ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional
equity securities.

As of March 31, 2025, Gryphon had outstanding a total of approximately
69,346,005 shares of common stock. Of these shares, approximately 51.3 million shares of common stock are freely tradable, without restriction,
in the public market, unless they are purchased by one of Gryphon’s affiliates.

Sales of these shares, or
perceptions that they will be sold, could cause the trading price of Gryphon’s common stock to decline.

41

Future sales and issuances of Gryphon’s
common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including in connection with pending acquisitions or pursuant to Gryphon’s equity
incentive plan, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of its stockholders and could cause Gryphon’s stock price
to fall.

Additional capital will be
needed in the future to continue Gryphon’s planned operations, entry into the AI and HPC industries and to pursue pending acquisitions.
To the extent Gryphon raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, its stockholders may experience substantial dilution. Gryphon
may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner it determines
from time to time. If Gryphon sells common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors
may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to Gryphon’s existing stockholders,
and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders.

Pursuant to the 2024 Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”), Gryphon’s board of directors is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based
awards to its employees, directors and consultants, which equity-based awards would also cause dilution to its stockholders. The number
of shares of Gryphon’s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2024 Plan was originally set at 15% of the total number of
the shares of common stock outstanding at the closing of the Merger, or 5,810,033 shares of common stock. If the board of directors of
Gryphon elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant by the maximum amount each year, stockholders may experience
additional dilution, which could cause Gryphon’s stock price to fall.

Delaware law and provisions in Gryphon’s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing
the trading price of Gryphon’s common stock.

Gryphon’s amended and
restated certificate of incorporation (as amended) and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of Gryphon’s
common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of Gryphon or changes in its management that the stockholders
of Gryphon may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:

●

establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of
    Gryphon’s board of directors are elected at one time;

●

permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors
    and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;

●

provide that directors may only be removed for cause;

●

require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in Gryphon’s
    bylaws;

●

prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all
    stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of Gryphon’s stockholders;

●

provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to amend
    or repeal Gryphon’s bylaws;

●

restrict the forum for certain litigation against Gryphon to Delaware;
    and

●

establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election
    to Gryphon’s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.

Any provision of Gryphon’s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended) or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring
a change in control could limit the opportunity for Gryphon’s stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Gryphon’s
common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Gryphon’s common stock.

42

Gryphon’s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation designate a state or federal court located within the state of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all
disputes between Gryphon and its stockholders, which could limit Gryphon’s stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum
for disputes with Gryphon or its directors, officers or employees.

Gryphon’s amended and
restated bylaws provide that, unless it consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Gryphon, (ii) any action asserting
a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of Gryphon to Gryphon or Gryphon’s stockholders,
(iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation
or amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine will be the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Delaware,
or if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware)
in all cases subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. These exclusive
forum provisions do not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

To the extent that any such claims may
be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce
any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.

Section 22 of the Securities
Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the
Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. However, Gryphon’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains
a federal forum provision which provides that unless Gryphon consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal
district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of
action arising under the Securities Act.

Any person or entity purchasing
or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of Gryphon’s securities will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision.
This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes
with Gryphon or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against Gryphon or its directors, officers
and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in Gryphon’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Gryphon may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions,
which could harm Gryphon’s results of operations.

Gryphon does not currently intend to pay
dividends on its common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation, if
any, in the price of Gryphon’s common stock.

Gryphon has never declared
or paid any cash dividend on Gryphon’s common stock. The expectation is that Gryphon will retain future earnings for the development,
operation and expansion of Gryphon’s business and Gryphon does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable
future. In addition, the New Loan Agreement with Anchorage prohibits Gryphon from declaring or paying any cash dividends without Anchorage’s
prior written consent, and the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude Gryphon from paying dividends. Any return to stockholders
will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. There is no guarantee that shares of Gryphon’s common stock will
appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.

43

There can be no assurance that we will
continue to be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.

Our continued eligibility
to maintain the listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq depends on a number of factors, including the price of our Common Stock and the
number of persons that hold our Common Stock. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet its listing
standards, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, and we are not able to list such
securities on another national securities exchange, then our Common Stock could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were
to occur, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including:

●

a limited availability of market quotations

●

reduced liquidity for our securities;

●

a determination that our common stock is a “penny
    stock,” which will require brokers trading the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced
    level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of common stock;

●

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage;
    and

●

a decreased ability for us to issue additional
    securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

On September 5, 2024, we
received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that the bid price for our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, had
closed below the minimum $1.00 per share and, as a result, we are not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for
the continued listing on Nasdaq, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A),
we had a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 4, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The Company
was provided with an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or 
until
March 4, 2025
, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The Company did not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid
Price Rule during the allotted time period. Accordingly, on March 5, 2025, the Company received a staff delist determination letter from
the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department, as a result of its failure to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The Company
was not automatically eligible for a second 180-day compliance period because it did not meet the initial listing requirement of $5.0
million of stockholders’ equity, or other listing alternatives, for Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth under Nasdaq Listing Rule
5505(b)(1).

On
September 13, 2024, we received another notice from Nasdaq notifying us that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2)
as a result of our Market Value of Listed Securities (the “MVLS”) falling below the minimum of $35 million required for continued
listing on Nasdaq (the “MVLS Requirement”) from July 31, 2024 to September 12, 2024. The Company was provided with an initial
compliance period of 180 calendar days, or 
until March 12, 2025
,
to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement. The Company did not regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement during the allotted time
period. Accordingly, on March 13, 2025, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department, as a result
of its failure to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, that this matter serves as an additional basis for delisting the
Company’s securities from Nasdaq.

The Company intends to timely
request a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). This hearing request will stay Nasdaq’s delisting of
the Company’s common stock pending the Panel’s decision and any extension provided by the Panel. The Company intends to present
its plan of compliance and will seek approval for an extension to execute and demonstrate compliance. The Company has retained Donohoe
Advisory Associates LLC to assist the Company in its preparation for the hearing and developing its compliance plan. However, there can

Uncertainty in accounting standards for
bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may lead to financial restatements and business disruptions.

Limited precedent exists
for the financial accounting of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets. Future changes in regulatory or accounting standards could require
us to alter our accounting practices and restate financial statements, potentially affecting how we account for newly mined cryptocurrency
rewards. Such changes could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. A restatement may
also raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, negatively affecting investor confidence and the value of cryptocurrencies
we hold or acquire.

Gryphon’s management is required
to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with public company regulations.

As a public company, Gryphon
incurs significant legal, accounting and other expenses that Gryphon did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, impose various requirements
on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. Gryphon’s management and other personnel will need
to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Certain members of Gryphon’s management do not have significant experience
in addressing these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase Gryphon’s legal and financial compliance costs
and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.

Among other things, Gryphon’s
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Gryphon’s compliance with these requirements requires that it incur substantial accounting
and related expenses and expend significant management efforts. Gryphon will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff to
comply with public company regulations. The costs of hiring such staff may be material and there can be no assurance that such staff
will be immediately available to Gryphon.

Moreover, if Gryphon identifies
deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, investors could lose confidence
in the accuracy and completeness of Gryphon’s financial reports, the market price of Gryphon’s common stock could decline
and Gryphon could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. As of December 31, 2024,
we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified two material weaknesses, as defined in the standards established
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the United States. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

As of December 31, 2024,
we identified the material weakness related to failure to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for accurate
and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We are in the process of developing a more comprehensive risk assessment process
to identify emerging risks while working with outside counsel and third-party vendors. We have implemented dual authorization controls
for high-value transactions. We are in the process of developing additional policies and procedures for key processes while hiring additional
full time employees to mitigate any segregation of duties risks for critical functions. Measures that we implement may not fully address
the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and we may not be able to conclude that the material
weakness has been fully remedied.

Information Security Program

The mission of our information
security organization is to design, implement, and maintain an information security program that protects our systems, services, and
data against unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, damage, and loss. The information security organization is comprised of internal
and external security and technology professionals. We continue to make investments in information security resources to mature, expand,
and adapt our capabilities to address emerging cybersecurity risks and threats.

Cybersecurity Risk Management
and Strategy

Cybersecurity risk management
is one component of our information security program that guides continuous improvement to, and evaluates the confidentiality, 
integrity
,
and availability of our critical systems, data, and operations.

Our approach to controls
and risk management is based on guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and the Crypto
Currency Security Standard (“CCSS”). This does not mean that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications,
or requirements, but rather that we use the NIST and CCSS as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity controls and
risks relevant to our business.

Our cybersecurity risk management
program includes:

●

Identifying cybersecurity risks that could impact our facilities, 
third-party
 vendors/partners, operations, critical systems, information, and broader enterprise IT environment. Risks are informed by threat intelligence, current and historical adversarial activity, and industry specify threats;

●

Performing a cybersecurity risk assessment to evaluate our readiness
    if the risks were to materialize; and

●

Ensuring risk is addressed and tracking any necessary remediation through
    an action plan.

While we face a number of
ongoing cybersecurity risks in connection with our business, such risks have 
not materially
 affected us to date, including our business
strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Cybersecurity Governance

Our Board considers cybersecurity
risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated the oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks to
the Board’s Audit Committee as well as hiring a 
third party vendor that specializes in cybersecurity to oversee and provide an
assessment on the Company’s IT controls.
 The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly to discuss matters involving cybersecurity
risks.

The Audit Committee ultimately
provides information to our board members regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity risks
. The Audit Committee
also receives a briefing and continuing education from a member of the third party vendor relating to our cyber risk management program
at least annually. 
The 
third party vendor
 is responsible for notifying the Audit Committee of material cybersecurity incidents.

Cybersecurity Incidents

In 2023, a threat actor representing
to be the Sphere 3D Corp. (“Sphere 3D”) CFO inserted themselves into an email exchange between the Sphere 3D CFO and the Company’s
former CEO, which also included Sphere 3D’s CEO, regarding the transfer of Sphere 3D’s BTC from the Company’s wallet
to Sphere 3D’s wallet. The threat actor requested that the BTC be transferred to an alternate wallet. As a result, 26 BTC, with
a value of approximately $560,000 at the time, was transferred to a wallet controlled by the threat actor. Via counsel, Gryphon engaged
with US Federal law enforcement to recover the BTC. Despite these attempts by law enforcement to recover the BTC, recovery was not possible.
Gryphon subsequently wired the commensurate amount in USD to Sphere 3D to make them whole for the stolen BTC. Gryphon also engaged a nationally
recognized third-party firm to perform a forensic analysis. The analysis revealed that the threat actor did not enter the email exchange
via Gryphon’s IT systems. The Company has also subsequently modified its control systems to protect against any future attempted
incursions. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company made a payment to Sphere 3D for $560,000, which was classified as a general
and administrative expense on Gryphon’s consolidated statement of operations.
