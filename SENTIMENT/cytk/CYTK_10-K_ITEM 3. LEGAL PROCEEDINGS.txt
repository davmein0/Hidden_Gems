ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O
F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.
Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators and next-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining. We have discovered and are developing muscle-directed investigational medicines that may potentially improve the healthspan of people with devastating cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases of impaired muscle function. Our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton, a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, we are discovering and developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact muscle function and contractility with objective to build a sustainable specialty biopharmaceutical business.

Our clinical-stage drug candidates are: (i) aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, (ii) omecamtiv mecarbil, a novel cardiac myosin activator, (iii) CK-586, an additional cardiac myosin inhibitor, and (iv) CK-089, a novel fast skeletal troponin activator.
For further information regarding our business, refer to Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sources and Uses of Cash
To date we have funded our operations and capital expenditures with proceeds primarily from private and public sales of our equity securities, royalty monetization agreement, and revenue interest agreements, strategic alliances, long-term debt, other financings and interest on investments. We have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our expenditures have historically primarily related to research and development activities, but have recently and will increasingly also relate to our commercial readiness activities and general commercialization activities upon regulatory approval of aficamten.

Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities of $395.9 million and $414.3 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively, was largely due to ongoing research and development activities and general and administrative expenses to support those activities. Net loss for 2024 and 2023 included, among other items: non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expense on liabilities related to revenue participation right purchase agreements, non-cash interest expense related to debt and non-cash changes in fair values related to derivative liabilities and liabilities related to RPI Transactions.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $553.1 million for 2024 was primarily due to purchases of investments offset by maturities of investments.

Net cash used in investing activities of $239.3 million for 2023 was primarily due to sales and maturities of investments offset by purchases of investments.
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $930.6 million in 2024 was due to $250.0 million in proceeds from the 2024 RPI Transactions, $563.2 million of net proceeds from a public offering, $50.0 million of net proceeds from a private placement, and issuances of common stock of $93.6 million under the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, discussed below, and stock-based award activities.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $221.3 million in 2023 was due to proceeds from public offerings of common stock of $164.2 million under the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co discussed below and $50.0 million of additional consideration associated with the 2022 RP Aficamten Royalty Purchase Agreement which was paid to us in September 2023 and stock-based award activities.

2024 Royalty Pharma Transactions
In May 2024, we entered into a series of financing agreements with affiliates of Royalty Pharma, including the RP OM Loan Agreement, the RP CK-586 RPA, the 2022 RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement Amendment, the RP Aficamten RPA Amendment, and the RP Stock Purchase Agreement for a private placement of common stock concurrent with our underwritten public offering of common stock.

The RP OM Loan Agreement provides for a loan in a principal amount of $100.0 million that was drawn at the closing with no remaining amounts available for disbursement. The loan under the RP OM Loan Agreement matures on the 10 year anniversary of the funding date and is repayable in quarterly installments, the amounts of which will depend on the occurrence of certain events related to the results and timing of COMET-HF and potential regulatory approvals of omecamtiv mecarbil, as follows:
•
Scenario 1: If the Phase 3 clinical trial of Cytokinetics’ proprietary small molecule cardiac myosin activator known as omecamtiv mecarbil is successful (defined as meeting the composite primary endpoint of the first event, whichever occurs first, comprising of cardiovascular death, heart failure event, LVAD implementation/cardiac transplantation, or stroke, with a hazard ratio (HR) of less than 0.85 and cardiovascular death endpoint HR of less than 1.0) by June 30, 2028 and we receive the marketing approval from the FDA for omecamtiv mecarbil on or prior to December 31, 2029 (“OM Approval Date”), commencing on the calendar quarter during which the FDA approval is obtained, we are required to pay RPDF (x) (i) $75.0 million ten business days after the OM Approval Date and (ii) $25.0 million on the first anniversary of the OM Approval Date and (y) on a quarterly basis an amount equal to 2.0% of the annual worldwide net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil, subject to a minimum floor amount ranging from $5.0 million to $8.0 million during the first 18 calendar quarters (the payment of the 2.0% of the annual worldwide net sales starting from the 19th calendar quarter shall be referred to as the “Royalty Payment”). Our obligation to pay the Royalty Payment will continue after maturity of the Loan;

40

Table of Contents

•
Scenario 2: If the Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil is successful by June 30, 2028 but we have not received the marketing approval from the FDA for omecamtiv mecarbil on or prior to December 31, 2029, we are required to pay RPDF 18 equal quarterly cash payments totaling 237.5% of the principal amount of the loan commencing on March 31, 2030; and
•
Scenario 3: If the Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil is not successful by June 30, 2028, we are required to pay RPDF 22 equal quarterly cash payments totaling 227.5% of the principal amount of the loan commencing on September 30, 2028. 
The interest on this loan is included in the scheduled payment amount for each scenario.

Pursuant to the RP CK-586 RPA, RPI ICAV purchased rights to up to 4.5% of worldwide net sales of CK-586 by us, our affiliates or licensees, in exchange for up to $200 million in consideration, $50 million of which was paid upfront and, following the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial (or the Phase 3 portion of the first Phase 2b/3 clinical trial) in HFpEF for CK-586, at RPI ICAV’s sole discretion, up to in aggregate $150 million to fund 50.0% of the research and development cost of CK-586. The initial $50 million paid to us entitles RPI ICAV to 1% of worldwide net sales of CK-586 by us, our affiliates, or licenses. We will not know for certain whether any additional funding under the RP CK-586 RPA will be available to us until the conclusion of AMBER-HFpEF, the results of the trial are known, and RPI ICAV has decided to exercise its option to purchase an incremental 3.5% revenue interest on our future annual worldwide net sales of CK-586 or not.

2022 Royalty Pharma Transactions
In January 2022, we entered into a series of financing agreements with affiliates of Royalty Pharma, including the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement, and the RP Aficamten RPA.
Under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement, we have drawn $100 million and an additional $350 million remains available to us for disbursement as long-term debt, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Of these available loans, we have satisfied the conditions to draw on the tranche 4 loan in the amount of $75 million upon receipt of positive results from SEQUOIA-HCM and tranche 5 in the amount of $100 million upon acceptance of the filing of our NDA for aficamten. We are obliged to draw at least $50 million of either the tranche 4 or tranche 5 facility by November 24, 2025. The remaining $175 million tranche 7 loan is subject to conditions related to the approval of our NDA for aficamten in patients with oHCM on or prior to December 31, 2025. We expect to draw all available loans under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement unless we are able to meet our financing requirements through more favorable funding sources. If, for any reason, we are unable to satisfy the conditions for disbursement of the remaining $175 million in available loans under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement, we would need to seek alternative debt or equity financing.

Each term loan under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement matures on the 10 year anniversary of the funding date for such term loan and is repayable in quarterly installments of principal, interest and fees commencing on the last business day of the seventh full calendar quarter following the calendar quarter of the applicable funding date for such term loan, with the aggregate amount payable in respect of each term loan (including interest and other applicable fees) equal to 190% of the principal amount of the tranche 1, tranche 4, tranche 5, tranche 6, and tranche 7 term loans (such amount with respect to each term loan, “Final Payment Amount”). We commenced repayment of the tranche 1 loan in the fourth quarter of 2023 and will continue to incur approximately $2.9 million in quarterly interest expenses for the tranche 1 loan until our repayment obligations are satisfied in full.
RP Aficamten Royalty Purchase Agreement
Under the RP Aficamten RPA, RPI ICAV purchased rights to certain revenue streams from net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten by us, our affiliates and our licensees in exchange for up to $150.0 million in consideration, $50.0 million of which was paid on the closing date, $50.0 million of which was paid to us in March 2022 following the initiation of the first pivotal trial in oHCM for aficamten, and $50.0 million of which was paid to us in September 2023 following the initiation of the first pivotal clinical trial in nHCM for aficamten.
RPI ICAV initially purchased the right to receive a percentage of net sales equal to 4.5% for annual worldwide net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten up to $1 billion and 3.5% for annual worldwide net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten in excess of $1 billion, subject to reduction in certain circumstances. However, in May 2024, we entered into the RP Aficamten RPA Amendment to restructure the royalty so that RPI will now receive 4.5% up to $5.0 billion of worldwide annual net sales of aficamten and 1% above $5.0 billion of worldwide annual net sales. Our liability to RPI ICAV is referred to as the “RP Aficamten Liability”.

41

Table of Contents

We account for the RP Aficamten Liability as a liability primarily because we have significant continuing involvement in generating the related revenue stream from which the liability will be repaid. If and when aficamten is commercialized and royalties become due, we will recognize the portion of royalties paid to RPI ICAV as a decrease to the RP Aficamten Liability and a corresponding reduction in cash.
The carrying amount of the RP Aficamten Liability is based on our estimate of the future royalties to be paid to RPI ICAV over the life of the arrangement as discounted using an imputed rate of interest. The imputed rate of interest on the carrying value of the RP Aficamten Liability was approximately 23.5% and 24.8% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Convertible Notes
On November 13, 2019, we issued $138.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes. On July 6, 2022, we issued $540.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes and used approximately $140.3 million of the net proceeds from the offering of 2027 Notes and issued 8,071,343 shares of common stock to repurchase approximately $116.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes pursuant to privately negotiated exchange agreements entered into with certain holders of the 2026 Notes concurrently with the pricing of the offering of the 2027 Notes. As a result of the partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes, we recorded an inducement loss of $22.2 million, consisting of the difference between the consideration to the holders pursuant to the exchange agreements and the if-converted value of the 2026 Notes under the original terms. As of December 31, 2024, there remains $21.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes outstanding and $540.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes outstanding. The 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes are redeemable, at our option at any time in the case of the 2026 Notes and at any time after July 7, 2025 in the case of the 2027 Notes and, in the case of any partial redemption, on or before the 60th scheduled trading day before the  maturity date for the relevant notes, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the relevant notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date but only if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for the relevant notes on (1) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we may send the related redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date we may send such notice.
China Out-license for Omecamtiv Mecarbil
In December 2021, we entered into the Corxel OM License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Corxel an exclusive license to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in China and Taiwan. In December 2024, we entered into a mutual termination agreement with Corxel to terminate the Corxel OM License Agreement. Accordingly, all rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil have reverted to us.
China Out-license for Aficamten
In July 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Corxel, pursuant to which we granted to Corxel an exclusive license to develop and commercialize aficamten in China and Taiwan. In December 2024, Corxel assigned its rights and obligations under our license and collaboration agreement to Genzyme Corporation, an affiliate of Sanofi. We recognized $15.0 million dollars from Corxel in connection with a modification of the original license prior to the assignment of Corxel's rights under our license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of aficamten to Sanofi and we may be eligible for another $10.0 million milestone from Corxel under certain commercial circumstances. We may be eligible to receive from Sanofi future milestone payments totaling up to $150.0 million for the achievement of certain development and commercial milestone events in connection to aficamten in oHCM and/or nHCM. In addition, Sanofi will pay us tiered royalties in the low-to-high teens range on the net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten in China and Taiwan, subject to certain reductions for generic competition, patent expiration and payments for licenses to third party patents. The Sanofi Aficamten License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue on a market-by-market basis until expiration of the relevant royalty term.

Japan Out-license for Aficamten
In November 2024, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer Consumer Care AG, an affiliate of Bayer AG, pursuant to which we granted to Bayer an exclusive license to develop and commercialize aficamten in Japan, subject to certain reserved development rights. Under the terms of the Bayer License Agreement, we received an up-front payment of €50.0 million (equivalent to $52.4 million at the time of payment) which was recorded as deferred revenue at December 31, 2024 and will be recognized upon the completion of certain performance obligations. We expect to fulfill and satisfy the associated performance obligation in the first half of 2025. We may be eligible to receive from Bayer future milestone payments totaling up to an additional €90 million upon achievement of milestones through commercial launch, including €20 million of which are near-term. We may also be eligible to receive up to an additional €490 million in commercial milestone payments upon the achievement by Bayer of certain sales milestones and tiered royalties on the net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten in Japan ranging from the high teens to the low thirty percents, subject to certain reductions for generic competition, expiration of certain patents and payments for licenses to third-party patents, until the latest of the expiration of certain patents, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the Product in Japan, and the end of a minimum specified term.
For collaborative agreements that have a performance obligation where the counterparty is a customer for the unit of account, we apply ASC 606, 
Revenue Recognition
, to the unit of account and the revenue is classified as License and milestone revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. For other transactions in collaborative arrangements, consisting of research and development cost reimbursements, we recognize the research and development cost reimbursements as collaboration revenues in our consolidated statement of operations.
At-the-Market Sales of Common Stock
In March 2023, we entered into the Amended ATM Facility, with Cantor, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $300.0 million through Cantor, as sales agent. We issued 5,016,170 and 1,237,460 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $164.2 million and $93.6 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively, under the Amended ATM Facility. We exercised our rights to terminate the Amended ATM Facility with Cantor in February 2024.

On February 27, 2025, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement
SM
 with Jefferies LLC under which we may offer and sell, from time to time, at our sole discretion, shares of common stock in “at the market offerings” pursuant to Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933 through Jefferies LLC, as sales agent.

Public Offering of Common Stock and Concurrent Private Offering
On May 28, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering of 9,803,922 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $51.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 1,470,588 shares of Common Stock at the public offering price. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $575 million and net proceeds were approximately $563.2 million, after deducting the applicable underwriting discounts and commissions. Concurrently with the closing of the underwritten public offering, RPI ICAV purchased 980,392 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the RP Stock Purchase Agreement, at a price of $51.00 per share in a concurrent private placement. The gross proceeds from the concurrent private placement were $50 million.
Future Uses of Cash
We expect that general and administrative expenses will significantly increase in 2025. We have submitted an NDA to FDA for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM, which was accepted for filing with a PDUFA target action date of September 26, 2025. Accordingly, we will be incurring expenses for the purpose of commercial readiness activities, including, but not limited to, the hiring and training of a field sales force, the implementation of compliance systems and sales and marketing expenses. In addition, we submitted an MAA to EMA for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM in the fourth quarter of 2024, which was validated by EMA, and therefore, we will be incurring similar expenses for commercial readiness activities in Europe but with additional expenses for the establishment of a corporate infrastructure to enable commercialization activities in key European markets. A significant portion of these anticipated commercial readiness expenses in the United States and Europe are not expenses that have been reflected in our financial statements for previous periods.

43

Table of Contents

In future periods, we also expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to expand our research programs and related research and development activities, including for the conduct of our on-going clinical trials for aficamten, omecamtiv mecarbil, CK-586 and CK-089. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of compounds from our other muscle biology programs through research to candidate selection to clinical development, and we expect to file investigational new drug applications. Cytokinetics and multiple third-party contract development manufacturing organizations entered into various scopes of work with respect to the manufacturing of aficamten.

Our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
the initiation, progress, timing, scope and completion of preclinical research, non-clinical development, CMC, and clinical trials for our drug candidates and other compounds;
•
the time, costs and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions related to our drug candidates, including with respect to our NDA submission for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM to FDA and our related MAA submission to EMA;
•
the jurisdictions in which we are granted regulatory approvals and thus are able to successfully launch our products for commercial sale;
•
delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies;
•
our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates;
•
the number of drug candidates we pursue and the stage of development that they are in;
•
the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims;
•
our ability to establish and maintain selected strategic alliances required for the development of drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs;
•
our plans or ability to expand our drug development capabilities, including our capabilities to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates;
•
our plans or ability to engage third-party manufacturers for our drug candidates and potential drugs;
•
our plans or ability to build or access sales and marketing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs;
•
the expansion and advancement of our research programs;
•
the hiring of additional employees and consultants;
•
the acquisition of technologies, products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments;
•
our revenues, if any, from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs;
•
the cost of additional construction to expand our headquarters in South San Francisco and the cost in relation to expanding our leased office facilities in Radnor, Pennsylvania or other leased office spaces in Europe; and
•
the payments due for interest on the term loan and convertible debt;
We have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $2.7 billion since inception and there can be no assurance that we will attain profitability. We are subject to risks common to clinical-stage companies including, but not limited to, development of new drug candidates, dependence on key personnel, and the ability to obtain additional capital as needed to fund our future plans. Our liquidity will be impaired if sufficient additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Until we achieve profitable operations, we intend to continue to fund operations through payments from strategic collaborations, additional sales of equity securities, grants and other financings. We have never generated revenues from commercial sales of our drugs. The earliest we might reasonably expect to commence commercial sales and record revenues is in 2025 following the acceptance for filing of our NDA for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM by FDA in September of 2024. Therefore, our success is dependent on our ability to obtain additional capital by entering into new strategic collaborations and/or through financings, and ultimately on our and our collaborators’ ability to successfully develop and market one or more of our drug candidates. We cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available from such collaborators or financings when needed or on satisfactory terms. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of our drug candidates will be accepted in the marketplace or that any future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, financial position and cash flows.

44

Table of Contents

Based on the current planning assumptions, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investments and interest earned on investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. If, at any time, our prospects for internally financing programs and activities decline, we may decide to reduce expenses across the business. Alternatively, we might raise funds through strategic relationships, public or private financings or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that funding, if needed, will be available on attractive terms, or at all, or in accordance with our planned timelines. Furthermore, financing obtained through future strategic relationships may require us to forego certain commercialization and other rights to our drug candidates. Similarly, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.
Segment Information
We have one primary business activity and operate in one reportable segment.
Results of Operations
A discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Results of Operations."
Revenues
Our revenues since inception were primarily from our strategic alliances. We have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date. The earliest we might reasonably expect to commence commercial sales and obtain revenues is in 2025 following the acceptance for filing of our NDA for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM by FDA in September 2024.
Revenues in 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows (in millions):

License and milestone revenues recognized in 2024 were attributable to a $15.0 million non-refundable upfront payment from Corxel in the fourth quarter of 2024 in connection with a modification of the original license prior to the assignment of Corxel’s rights under our license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of aficamten in China and Taiwan to Sanofi. The $15.0 million is reflected as a receivable at December 31, 2024. License and milestone revenues for 2023 consisted of a milestone recognized from Corxel for the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trial of aficamten in nHCM.

Collaboration revenues in 2024 were primarily from Corxel under our collaboration and license agreement with Corxel (now assigned to Genzyme Corporation, an affiliate of Sanofi). As of December 31, 2024 receivables of $1.5 million were recorded related to Corxel. In 2023, Collaboration revenues were primarily from Astellas for reimbursements under the Astellas FSRA Agreement. Under the Astellas FSRA Agreement, Astellas agreed to pay one-third of the out-of-pocket clinical development costs which was incurred in connection with the Company’s Phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in ALS, up to a maximum contribution by Astellas of $12 million. On March 31, 2023, we announced that we would be discontinuing COURAGE-ALS, our Phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with ALS, and COURAGE-ALS OLE. As of December 31, 2023 we billed and collected the maximum contribution of $12.0 million from Astellas, and no further revenue is expected under this arrangement.
In November 2024, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Bayer Consumer Care AG, an affiliate of Bayer AG, pursuant to which we granted to Bayer an exclusive license to develop and commercialize aficamten in Japan, subject to certain reserved development rights. Under the terms of the Bayer License Agreement, we received an up-front payment of €50.0 million (equivalent to $52.4 million at the time of payment) which was recorded as deferred revenue at December 31, 2024 and will be recognized upon the completion of certain performance obligations. We expect to fulfill and satisfy the associated performance obligation in the first half of 2025.

Research and development expenses increased to $339.4 million in 2024 from $330.1 million in 2023, primarily due to advancing our clinical trials and higher personnel related costs.
We continue to develop aficamten to treat both oHCM and nHCM in three additional clinical trials, as follows: (i) MAPLE-HCM is our Phase 3 clinical trial of aficamten as a monotherapy for patients with oHCM, (ii) ACACIA-HCM is a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with symptomatic nHCM, and (iii) CEDAR-HCM, our placebo-controlled and open-label extension clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of aficamten in a pediatric population with symptomatic oHCM. Additionally, we have FOREST-HCM which is an open label extension study designed to assess the long term safety and tolerability of aficamten in patients with symptomatic oHCM.
We continue to develop omecamtiv mecarbil in COMET-HF, a Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with symptomatic HFrEF with severely reduced ejection fraction. The intention of the $100 million RP OM Loan Agreement was to partially cover the costs of the COMET-HF clinical trial.
We recently announced our commencement of AMBER-HFpEF, a Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-586 in patients with symptomatic HFpEF, in which patient enrollment commenced in the first quarter of 2025. The $50 million in proceeds from the RP CK-586 RPA are intended to offset expenses related to the conduct of AMBER-HFpEF. If the results of AMBER-HFpEF are supportive of continuing the development of CK-586 and commencing a Phase 3 clinical trial, we expect to Royalty Pharma to cover potentially 50% of the continued development of CK-586 up to $150 million, subject to Royalty Pharma’s opt-in right to acquire an additional 3.5% revenue interest in our or our licensee’s future worldwide net sales of CK-586.
Finally, we also recently announced commencement of our Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose clinical study of CK-089, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator with the potential therapeutic application to a specific type of muscular dystrophy and other conditions of impaired muscle function.
We expect that research and development expenses will increase in 2025 relative to 2024 due to ongoing clinical trials of aficamten, COMET in HFrEF, AMBER HFpEF, manufacturing of drug product and raw materials for aficamten to enable a potential commercial launch and employee related costs.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions, including, but not limited to, finance, human resources, legal, business and commercial development and strategic planning. Other significant costs include facilities costs, consulting costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance.

General and administrative expenses increased to $215.3 million in 2024 from $173.6 million in 2023, primarily due to investments in commercial readiness and higher personnel related costs, including stock based compensation.
We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in 2025. We have submitted an NDA to FDA for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM. Accordingly, we will be incurring additional expenses for commercial readiness activities, included, but not limited to, the hiring and training of a field sales force, the implementation of compliance systems, sales and marketing expenses. In addition. we submitted an MAA to EMA for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM in the fourth quarter of 2024, and therefore, we will be incurring similar expenses for commercial readiness activities in Europe but with additional expenses for the establishment of a corporate infrastructure to enable commercialization activities in key European markets.

The components of interest expense were fairly consistent period over period in 2024 and 2023. The most significant change was related to Term loan interest expense increasing due to drawing on Tranche 6 of the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement Amendment in the second quarter of 2024. Interest expense in 2024 also included approximately $4.8 million of financing fees related to the 2024 RPI Transactions.

We expect our interest expenses in 2025 to increase under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement as we draw upon additional loans available to us thereunder.
Non-cash interest expense on liabilities related to revenue participation right purchase agreements

Non-cash interest expense results from the accretion of our liabilities to RPFT and RP ICAV related to the sale of future royalties under the RP OM RPA and the RP Aficamten RPA, respectively.
The carrying amount of the RP Aficamten Liability is based on our estimate of the future royalties to be paid pursuant to RP Aficamten RPA over the life of the arrangement as discounted using an imputed rate of interest. In the second quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional $33.3 million to the carrying value related to the RP Aficamten RPA Amendment entered into May 22, 2024. The imputed rate of interest on the carrying value of the RP Aficamten Liability was approximately 23.5% as of December 31, 2024 and 24.8% as of December 31, 2023.
The carrying amount of the RP OM Liability is based on our estimate of the future royalties to be paid pursuant to RP OM RPA over the life of the arrangement as discounted using an imputed rate of interest. The excess of future estimated royalty payments over the $92.3 million of allocated proceeds, less issuance costs, is recognized as non-cash interest expense using the effective interest method. The imputed rate of interest on the carrying value of the RP OM Liability was approximately 0.1% as of December 31, 2024 and 0.1% as of December 31, 2023.

We review our assumptions on a regular basis and our estimates may change in the future as we refine and reassess our assumptions.

Change in fair value liabilities related to RPI transactions and derivative liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Operations
The change in fair value liabilities related to the RPI transactions (RP OM Loan Agreement and CK-586 RPA) and the derivative liabilities for the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement for 2024 were as follows (in millions):

Total change in fair value liabilities

(18.3

)

The fair values of the liabilities related to RPI transactions (RP OM Loan Agreement and CK-586 RPA) are based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of clinical success and regulatory approval based on historical industry success rates for product development specific to cardiovascular products, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of pricing, sales ramp, variables for the timing of the related events, probability of change of control, and discount rates (which range from 10% to 18% as of December 31, 2024), which are deemed to be Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. As products containing omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-586 have not yet been commercialized, the estimates are highly subjective. For example, assumed increases in the probability of the clinical success for the omecamtiv mecarbil or CK-586 programs could increase the value of the liabilities. Similarly, assumed decreases in the discount rates used in the fair value measurements could also increase the value of the liabilities at period end.
The fair values of the derivative liabilities is determined using the probability-weighted expected return method and the “with and without” method. The fair values are based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of change of control, the probability of default (less than 10%), discount rates (ranging from 10% to 16% as of December 31, 2024) and other factors.
The total change in the estimated fair value liabilities for 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the RP CK-586 RPA as of December 31, 2024, compared to June 30, 2024. This decrease resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the liabilities and the recognition of a loss on the change in fair value of liabilities related to RPI transactions of approximately $19.6 million for 2024.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements

Table of Contents

Fair Value of 2024 RPI transactions
In May 2024, the Company entered into 2024 RPI transactions including the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement, the RP CK-586 RPA, the RP Stock Purchase Agreement, the 2022 RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement Amendment and the RP Aficamten RPA Amendment. As permitted under Accounting Standards Codification 825, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825, the Company elected the fair value option for recognition of the liabilities related to 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the RP CK-586 RPA. In accordance with ASC 825, the Company records the liabilities at fair value and remeasures the liabilities at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value associated with non-credit components are recognized in Other income (expense), net, while the change in fair value associated with credit components is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The fair value of the liabilities is based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of clinical success, the probability of regulatory approval, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of pricing, sales ramp, variables for the timing of the related events, probability of change of control, discount rates and other estimates, which are deemed to be Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. As products containing omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-586 have not yet been commercialized, the estimates are highly subjective. As of December 31, 2024, the discount rates that we used in the measurement of the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the RP CK-586 RPA decreased compared to June 30, 2024, which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the liabilities and the recognition of a loss on the change in the fair value of liabilities related to RPI transactions in our consolidated statement of operations of approximately $19.6 million in 2024. See Note 3 — Agreements with Royalty Pharma for further detail.
Derivative Liabilities
We recognize liabilities of our embedded derivative instruments related to the RP Multi Tranche Loan at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Each period, the fair value of the derivative liabilities are recalculated and resulting gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the derivatives with non-credit components are recognized in income, while the change in fair value associated with credit components is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Estimating fair values of derivative instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. Since derivative instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair value, the Company’s income will reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption changes.

Revenue Participation Right Purchase Agreements

We have entered into certain revenue participation right purchase agreements for omecamtiv mecarbil, aficamten, and CK-586 with affiliates of Royalty Pharma, pursuant to which such affiliates purchased rights to royalties from certain revenue streams. We typically account for such agreements as liabilities to be amortized under the effective interest rate method over the life of the related royalty stream, when we have continuing involvement with the underlying research and development activities. We typically account for such agreements as deferred income to be amortized under the units-of-revenue method, when there is no continuing involvement with the underlying research and development activities. We are required to update our estimates, each reporting period, related to the amount and timing of future royalty payments to be paid to the counterparties of the revenue participation right purchase agreements. The estimates of the future royalty payment determine the measurement of the non-cash interest expense and the carrying value of the liability.

Revenue participation right purchase agreements are measured using significant unobservable inputs. The estimates of future royalties requires the use of several assumptions such as: the probability of clinical success, the probability of regulatory approval, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of eligible patient populations, estimates of prescribing behavior and patient behavior, estimates of pricing, payor reimbursement and coverage, and sales ramp. As products containing aficamten, omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-586 have not yet been commercialized, the estimates are highly subjective.

The carrying amount of the liabilities are based on our estimate of the future royalties to be paid over the life of the arrangements as discounted using an imputed rate of interest. The imputed rate of interest on the RP Aficamten Liability was approximately 23.5% as of December 31, 2024 and 24.8% as of December 31, 2023. The imputed rate of interest on the RP OM Liability was approximately 0.1% as of December 31, 2024 and 0.1% as of December 31, 2023. We periodically assess the amount and timing of expected royalty payments and account for any changes in such estimates on a prospective basis.

As of December 31, 2024, we have a total carrying value of approximately $462.2 million of liabilities related to revenue participation right purchase agreements.

Accrued Research and Development Expenditures
Clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expense. We accrue and expense clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with clinical research and manufacturing organizations and clinical sites. We determine the actual costs through monitoring patient enrollment, communications with internal personnel and external service providers regarding the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA
TIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include risk related to interest rate sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, our cash and investments totaled $1221.1 million, comprising U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. and non-U.S. government agency bonds, commercial paper, a global portfolio of corporate debt, money market funds, and repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities.
Our investments are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates.

A hypothetical 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decline in the value of our investments of approximately $6.1 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

In addition, we have elected the fair value option for certain liabilities. The fair value of the liabilities related to 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement, the RP CK-586 RPA, and the derivatives of the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement will increase as market interest rates decrease. In addition, the fair value of the liabilities may fluctuate based upon changes in the Company’s credit rating. Changes in the interest rate environment and the credit rating of the Company could have an effect on our future earnings. For example, a hypothetical 1% decrease in the discount rates used to measure the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement, the RP CK-586 RPA, and the derivatives of the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement would result an increase in the fair value, and the recognition of a loss, of approximately $5.4 million as of December 31, 2024. In 2024, we recognized a loss on the change in the estimated fair value of liabilities of approximately $19.6 million, primarily due to changes in the discount rates used to measure the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the RP CK-586 RPA. The discount rates ranged from 10% to 18% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 14% to 18% as of June 30, 2024, resulting in an increase in the estimated fair value of the liabilities.
We had $21.1 million under 2026 Notes with a fixed rate of 4.0% and $540.0 million under 2027 Notes with a fixed rate of 3.5% outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The convertible notes issued at fixed interest rates are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market price and interest rates. We do not record our convertible debt at fair value but present the fair value for disclosure purposes (see Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes was estimated at $95.1 million and $651.7 million using quoted market prices.

Measurement of Revenue Participation Right Purchase Agreements

Description of

the Matter

As of December 31, 2024, the liabilities related to revenue participation right purchase agreements, net were $462.2 million. The Company recognized non-cash interest expense on the liabilities related to revenue participation right purchase agreements of $(48.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into agreements, pursuant to which counterparties purchased rights to receive royalty streams from the net sales of pharmaceutical products containing Aficamten and Omecamtiv Mecarbil. The cash received by the Company from these royalty purchase agreements was initially recognized as a liability related to revenue participation right purchase agreements. The Company is required to update its estimate, each reporting period, related to the amount and timing of future royalty payments to be paid to the counterparties of the revenue participation right purchase agreements. The estimates of the future royalty payment determine the measurement of the non-cash interest expense and the carrying value of the liability.

Auditing the Company’s measurement of the revenue participation right purchase agreements was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in projecting future royalty payments to be paid to the counterparties of the revenue participation right purchase agreements. The estimates of future royalties requires the use of several assumptions such as: the probability of clinical success, the probability of regulatory approval, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of eligible patient populations, estimates of prescribing behavior and patient behavior, estimates of pricing and payor reimbursement and coverage, and sales ramp. As products containing Aficamten and Omecamtiv Mecarbil have not yet been commercialized, the estimates are highly subjective.

How We

Addressed the Matter in Our

Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s processes for estimating the amount and timing of future royalty payments.
To test the amount and timing of future royalty payments to be paid to the counterparties of the revenue participation right purchase agreements, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions included consideration of (i) relevant industry forecasts and data, (ii) consistency with observable data for competitor products, and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Fair Value Liabilities

Description of

the Matter

In May 2024, the Company entered into the 2024 RPI transactions including the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement, the RP CK-586 RPA, and the 2022 RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement Amendment. The Company elected the fair value option for recognition of the liabilities related to 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the RP CK-586 RPA and remeasures the liabilities at fair value each reporting period.  In addition, the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement has embedded derivatives which are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of liabilities related to RPI transactions measured at fair value were $137.0 million and the derivative liabilities measured at fair value were $11.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a change in fair value of liabilities related to RPI Transactions of $(19.6) million and a change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $1.3 million. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the fair values of the liabilities for the RP OM Loan Agreement and CK-586 RPA are based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of clinical success and regulatory approval based on historical industry success rates for product development specific to cardiovascular products, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of pricing, sales ramp, variables for the timing of the related events, probability of change of control, and discount rates. The fair values of the embedded derivatives are based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of change of control and the probability of default.

Auditing the Company’s measurement of the fair value of the 2024 RPI transactions and the ongoing measurement of the fair value liabilities and derivative liabilities was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty.

How We

Addressed the Matter in Our

Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s processes for estimating the fair value of the fair value liabilities and derivative liabilities.
To test the measurement of the fair value liabilities and derivative liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, a review of the valuation methods, key valuation assumptions, preparation of corroborative valuations, and testing the cash proceeds from the financing.

CYTOKINETICS, INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — Organization and Accounting Policies
Organization
Cytokinetics, Incorporated (the “Company”, “we” or “our”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 5, 1997. We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics that modulate muscle function for the potential treatment of serious diseases and medical conditions.
Our financial statements contemplate the conduct of our operations in the normal course of business. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately 
$
2.7
 billion
 since inception and there can be no assurance that we will attain profitability. We had a net loss of 
$
589.5
 million
 and net cash used in operations of 
$
395.9
 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2024. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased to 
$
1,221.1
 million
 as of December 31, 2024 from 
$
655.4
 million
 as of December 31, 2023. We anticipate that we will have operating losses and net cash outflows in future periods.
We are subject to risks common to late-stage biopharmaceutical companies including, but not limited to, development of new drug candidates, dependence on key personnel, and the ability to obtain additional capital as needed to fund our future plans. Our liquidity will be impaired if sufficient additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to us. To date, we have funded operations primarily through sales of our common stock, contract payments under our collaboration agreements, sales of future revenues and royalties, debt financing arrangements, and interest income. Until we achieve profitable operations, we intend to continue to fund operations through payments from strategic collaborations, additional sales of equity securities, grants and debt financings. We have never generated revenues from commercial sales of our drugs. The earliest we might reasonably expect to commence commercial sales and record revenues is in 2025 following the acceptance for filing of our NDA for aficamten for the treatment of oHCM by FDA in September of 2024. Our success is dependent on our ability to obtain additional capital by entering into financings or new strategic collaborations, and ultimately on our and our collaborators’ ability to successfully develop and market one or more of our drug candidates. We cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available from financings or such collaborators when needed or on satisfactory terms. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any of our drug candidates will be accepted in the marketplace or that any future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results, financial position and cash flows.
Based on the current status of our research and development activities, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to fund cash requirements for at least the next 
12
 months after the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 
If, at any time, our prospects for financing our research and development programs decline, we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying, discontinuing or reducing our funding of one or more of our research or development programs. Alternatively, we might raise funds through strategic collaborations, public or private financings or other arrangements. Such funding, if needed, may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty
.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cytokinetics, Incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segment Information
We have 
one
 primary business activity and operate in 
one
 reportable segment.
Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our 
Chief Executive Officer ("CEO")
 who evaluates performance and makes operating decisions about allocating resources based on financial data presented on a consolidated basis. The measures of profitability and the significant segment expenses reviewed by the CODM are consistent with these financial statements and footnotes.

CYTOKINETICS, INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments, and accounts receivable.
Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments held with large financial institutions in the United States and deposits may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s insurance limit.
Drug candidates we develop may require approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. There can be no assurance that our drug candidates will receive any of the required approvals or clearances. If we were to be denied approval, or clearance or any such approval or clearance was to be delayed, it would have a material adverse impact on us.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the amount reported within our consolidated statements of cash flows was as follows (in thousands):

$

$

113,399

As of December 31, 2024, our restricted cash balance of 
$
0.4
 million
 recorded in other assets is used to collateralize letters of credit.
Investments
Our investments consist of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, commercial paper, corporate obligations, and money market funds. We designate all investments as available-for-sale and report them at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term investments.

All of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. For each available-for-sale investment whose fair value is below its amortized cost, we determine if the impairment is a result of a credit-related loss or other factors using both quantitative and qualitative factors. If the impairment is a result of a credit-related loss, we recognize an allowance for credit losses. 
If the impairment is not a result of a credit loss, we recognize the loss in other comprehensive loss.

Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally 
three years
 for computer equipment and software, 
five years
 for laboratory equipment and office equipment, and 
seven years
 for furniture and fixtures. Amortization of leasehold improvements and finance lease right-of-use assets are computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets, typically ranging from 
three
 to 
twelve years
.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets
We review long-lived assets, including property, equipment and right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. We would recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.

CYTOKINETICS, INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Leases
We determine if the arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset. The lease classification is determined at lease commencement, which is the date the underlying asset is available for use by the Company, and preliminary based on whether the arrangement is effectively a financed purchase of the underlying asset (finance lease) or not (operating lease). We determined the lease term at the commencement date by considering whether renewal options and termination options are reasonably assured of exercise. In addition to the fixed minimum lease payments required under the lease arrangements, certain leases include payments of operating expenses that may be revised based on the landlord’s estimate. These variable payments are excluded from the lease payments used to determine the right-of-use asset and lease liability and are recognized when the associated activity occurs.
We recognize right-of-use assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for operating leases. The right-of-use asset and short-term and long-term lease liabilities for finance leases are recognized in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.
In determining the present value of lease payments, we estimated our incremental borrowing rate based on information available upon commencement. We base the lease liabilities on the present value of remaining lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases using an estimated rate of interest that we would pay to borrow equivalent funds on a collateralized basis at the lease commencement date. The initial right-of-use asset, for both operating and finance leases, is measured based on the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs, lease prepayments, and lease incentives.
We recognize rent expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Finance lease right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life or the lease term, and the carrying amount of the lease liability is adjusted to reflect interest, which is recorded in interest expense.
We exclude from our consolidated balance sheets recognition of leases having a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases). We account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for our operating leases.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for those goods or services.

At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and determine those that are performance obligations. For example, a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from other performance obligations if licensee is able to use and benefit from the license on its own.

We enter into collaborative arrangements with partners that typically include payment to us for one of more of the following: (i) up-front license fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals; (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products; and (iv) research and development cost reimbursements. Up-front license fees are included in the transaction price. Development and regulatory milestone payments are included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method, if we conclude it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. For contracts that include sales-based royalties or sales-based milestones, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty or sales-based milestone has been allocated has been satisfied. For collaborative agreements that have a performance obligation where the counterparty is a customer for the unit of account, we apply ASC 606, 
Revenue Recognition
, to the unit of account and the revenue is classified as License and milestone revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. For other transactions in collaborative arrangements, consisting of research and development cost reimbursements, we recognize the research and development cost reimbursements as collaboration revenues in our consolidated statement of operations.
When a collaborative agreement has more than one performance obligation, we must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. The stand-alone selling price may include such items as, forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success, to determine the transaction price to allocate to each performance obligation.

For performance obligations that consist of the delivery of an intellectual property license, the revenue is recognized at the point in time that the license is delivered.
Accrued Research and Development Expenditures
Clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expense. We accrue and expense clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with clinical research and manufacturing organizations and clinical sites. We determine the actual costs through monitoring patient enrollment, discussions with internal personnel and external service providers regarding the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services.
Revenue Participation Right Purchase Agreements
We have entered into certain revenue participation right purchase agreements with RPI ICAV, pursuant to which such investors purchased rights to royalties from aficamten and omecamtiv mecarbil revenue streams in exchange for consideration. We account for such agreements as liabilities to be amortized under the effective interest rate method over the life of the related royalty stream, when we have continuing involvement with the underlying R&D. We are required to update our estimates, at each reporting period, related to the amount and timing of future royalty payments to be paid to the counterparties of the revenue participation right purchase agreements. The estimates of the future royalty payment determine the measurement of the non-cash interest expense and the carrying value of the liability.

Revenue participation right purchase agreements are measured using significant unobservable inputs. The estimates of future royalties requires the use of several assumptions such as: the probability of clinical success, the probability of regulatory approval, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of eligible patient populations, estimates of prescribing behavior and patient compliance behavior, estimates of pricing, payor reimbursement and coverage, and sales ramp. As products containing aficamten and omecamtiv mecarbil have not yet been commercialized, the estimates are highly subjective.

Fair Value of 2024 RPI transactions
In May 2024, the Company entered into 2024 RPI transactions including the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement, the RP CK-586 RPA, the RP Stock Purchase Agreement, the 2022 RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement Amendment and the RP Aficamten RPA Amendment. As permitted under Accounting Standards Codification 825
, Financial Instruments,
 or ASC 825, the Company elected the fair value option for recognition of the liabilities related to 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the RP CK-586 RPA. In accordance with ASC 825, the Company records the liabilities at fair value and remeasures the liabilities at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value associated with non-credit components are recognized in Other income (expense), net, while the change in fair value associated with credit components is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The fair value of the liabilities is based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of clinical success, the probability of regulatory approval, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of pricing, sales ramp, variables for the timing of the related events, probability of change of control, discount rates and other estimates, which are deemed to be Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. As products containing omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-586 have not yet been commercialized, the estimates are highly subjective.

Derivative Liabilities
We recognize liabilities of our embedded derivative instruments related to the RP Multi Tranche Loan at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Each period, the fair value of the derivative liabilities are recalculated and resulting gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the derivatives with non-credit components are recognized in income, while the change in fair value associated with credit components is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Estimating fair values of derivative instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. Since derivative instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair value, the Company’s income will reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption changes.

Research and Development Expenditures
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial costs, clinical manufacturing costs, preclinical study expenses, technical operations, consulting and other third-party costs, employee compensation, supplies and materials, allocation of overhead and occupancy costs, facilities costs and depreciation of equipment.

Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
We recognize uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Tax positions are initially recognized when it is

more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense.
Stock-Based Compensation
We maintain equity incentive plans under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, performance-based stock units and stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees, directors, consultants and advisors. In addition, we maintain an ESPP under which employees may purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions.
Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees and directors is recognized based on the grant date estimated fair values using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period.

Stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based stock units granted to employees is recognized based on the grant-date fair value of each award and recorded as expense over the vesting period using the ratable method when the underlying performance conditions are deemed probable.
Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP is recognized based on the fair value of each award estimated on the first day of the offering period using the Black Scholes option pricing model and recorded as expense over the service period using the straight-line method.
Note 2 — Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of vested common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, including outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock, warrants, convertible preferred stock and shares issuable under our ESPP, during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible notes using the if-converted method.
The following instruments were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because their effect would have been antidilutive (in thousands):

Note 3 — 
Agreements with Royalty Pharma
On January 7, 2022, we announced that we had entered into the 2022 RPI Transactions with affiliates of Royalty Pharma International plc.
Pursuant to the 2022 RPI Transactions, the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement and the RP Aficamten RPA described below, are determined to be debt instruments subsequently measured at amortized cost and were entered into with parties that were at the time of our entry into the 2022 RPI Transactions affiliated and in contemplation of one another. We used the relative fair value method and made separate estimates of the fair value of each freestanding financial instrument and then allocated the proceeds in proportion to those fair value amounts. Arrangement consideration for the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement and the RP Aficamten RPA totaled $
150
 million, consisting of the two $
50
 million up front payments for the signing of the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement and the RP Aficamten RPA and milestone of $
50
 million for initiation of the first pivotal trial in oHCM for aficamten that was deemed probable at the signing of the agreements.

On May 22, 2024, we announced that we had entered into the 2024 RPI Transactions with affiliates of Royalty Pharma International plc, which included an amendment the RP Aficamten RPA, a component of the 2022 RPI Transactions. The 2024 RPI Transactions include the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement, the RP CK-586 RPA, the RP Stock Purchase Agreement, the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement Amendment and the RP Aficamten RPA Amendment, as described below, are accounted for as a debt modification of the 2022 RPI Transactions.

Liabilities Related to RPI Transactions Measured at Fair Value
As permitted under ASC 825, we elected the fair value option for recognizing the liabilities related to the 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the RP CK-586 RPA. The fair value option was elected because these liabilities included embedded derivatives which would have otherwise required separate recognition and measurement. The Company elected the fair value option as it is believed to more practical for each liability as a single unit of account at fair value. Under the fair value option, debt issuance costs are expensed as incurred and the Company is required to record the fair value option elected arrangements at their fair value on the date of issuance and at each balance sheet thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the arrangements are recognized as changes in fair value of liabilities related to RPI Transactions in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

RP OM Loan
The RP OM Loan Agreement provides for a loan in a principal amount of $
100.0
 million that was drawn at the closing.

The loan under the RP OM Loan Agreement matures on the 
10 year
 anniversary of the funding date and is repayable in quarterly installments as follows:
•
Scenario 1: If the Phase 3 clinical trial of Cytokinetics’ proprietary small molecule cardiac myosin activator known as omecamtiv mecarbil is successful (defined as meeting the composite primary endpoint of the first event, whichever occurs first, comprising of cardiovascular death, heart failure event, LVAD implementation/cardiac transplantation, or stroke, with a hazard ratio (HR) of less than 0.85 and cardiovascular death endpoint HR of less than 1.0) by June 30, 2028 and we receive the marketing approval from the FDA for omecamtiv mecarbil on or prior to December 31, 2029 (“OM Approval Date”), commencing on the calendar quarter during which the FDA approval is obtained, we are required to pay RPDF (x) (i) $
75.0
 million ten business days after the OM Approval Date and (ii) $
25.0
 million on the first anniversary of the OM Approval Date and (y) on a quarterly basis an amount equal to 
2.0
% of the annual worldwide net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil, subject to a minimum floor amount ranging from $
5.0
 million to $
8.0
 million during the first 18 calendar quarters (the payment of the 
2.0
% of the annual worldwide net sales starting from the 19th calendar quarter shall be referred to as the “Royalty Payment”). Our obligation to pay the Royalty Payment will continue after maturity of the Loan;
•
Scenario 2: If the Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil is successful by June 30, 2028 but we have not received the marketing approval from the FDA for omecamtiv mecarbil on or prior to December 31, 2029, we are required to pay RPDF 
18 equal quarterly
 cash payments totaling 
237.5
% of the principal amount of the loan commencing on 
March 31, 2030
; and
•
Scenario 3: If the Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil is not successful by June 30, 2028, we are required to pay RPDF 
22 equal quarterly
 cash payments totaling 
227.5
% of the principal amount of the loan commencing on 
September 30, 2028
;
(the aggregate amount to be paid by us with respect to each scenario is referred to as the “Scheduled Payment Amount”).
The interest of the loan is included in the Scheduled Payment Amount for each scenario. In each scenario, we may prepay the loan in full (but not in part) at any time at its option by paying an amount equal to the unpaid portion of Scheduled Payment Amount for the outstanding loan; provided that, in scenario 1, we would be required to continue to pay the Royalty Payment after such prepayment.

In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company, the loan is repayable in full at the option of either the Company or the lender in an amount equal to (x) depending on when such change of control occurs, 
150.0
% to 
237.5
% of the principal amount of the loan minus (y) the then paid Scheduled Payment Amount. The RP OM Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on dispositions, mergers, indebtedness, encumbrances, distributions, stock repurchases, investments and transactions with affiliates.

The RP OM Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including but not limited to the nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, material adverse changes, attachment, levy, restraint on business, cross-defaults on material indebtedness, bankruptcy, delisting, material judgments, misrepresentations, governmental approvals, payment defaults under other royalty purchase agreements and development funding agreements with RPDF or RPI ICAV. Upon an event of default or simultaneously with payment in full of the term loans in the RP OM Loan Agreement, the lenders may, among other things, accelerate the loan (with the amount payable between 
227.5
% and 
237.5
% of the principal amount (less amounts previously paid) in the case of other events of default).
Upon execution of the RP OM Loan Agreement
 in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded liabilities of $
104.7
 million using the probability-weighted expected return method and the fair value inputs are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

CK-586 RPA
Pursuant to the RP CK-586 RPA, RPI ICAV purchased rights to certain revenue streams from worldwide net sales of CK-586 by us, our affiliates or licensees, in exchange for up to $
200
 million in consideration, $
50
 million of which was paid up-front and, following the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial (or the Phase 3 portion of the first Phase 2b/3 clinical trial) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in humans for CK-586, at RPI ICAV’s sole option and discretion, up to in aggregate $
150
 million in quarterly payments to fund 
50.0
% of the research and development cost for a potential Phase 3 clinical trial of CK-586.

Pursuant to the RP CK-586 RPA, RPI ICAV purchased the right to receive a percentage of net sales ranging from 
1.0
% to up to 
4.5
% for annual worldwide net sales of CK-586 (depending on the aggregate amounts funded by RPI ICAV), subject to reduction in certain circumstances, and will receive a 0.75x milestone payment upon market approval of CK-586 by the FDA, or if market approval of CK-586 by the European Medicines Agency is obtained prior to market approval by the FDA, 0.375x milestone payment for such obtained approval and 0.375x milestone payment upon subsequent market approval by the FDA.

Upon execution of the RP CK-586 RPA
 in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a liability of $
12.7
 million using a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the probability-weighted expected return method. The fair value inputs are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
We account for the RP CK-586 RPA as a liability because, among other reasons, we have significant continuing involvement in generating the related revenue stream from which the liability will be repaid.

Accounting for RPI Transactions Measured at Fair Value

The fair values of the liabilities for the RP OM Loan Agreement and CK-586 RPA are based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of clinical success and regulatory approval based on historical industry success rates for product development specific to cardiovascular products, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of pricing, sales ramp, variables for the timing of the related events, probability of change of control, and discount rates (which range from 
10
% to 
18
%
 as of December 31, 2024), which are deemed to be Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. As products containing omecamtiv mecarbil and CK-586 have not yet been commercialized, the estimates are highly subjective. For example, assumed increases in the probability of the clinical success for the omecamtiv mecarbil or CK-586 programs could increase the value of the liabilities. Similarly, assumed decreases in the discount rates used in the fair value measurements could also increase the value of the liabilities at period end.
In 2024, the Company recorded a loss of 
$
19.6
 million
 associated with the 
change in fair value of the liabilities
 related to 2024 RP OM Loan Agreement and the CK-586 RPA. The change in the fair value has been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

Liabilities Related to Revenue Participation Right Purchase Agreements
RP Aficamten Royalty Purchase Agreement
On January 7, 2022, we entered into the RP Aficamten RPA with RPI ICAV, pursuant to which RPI ICAV purchased rights to certain revenue streams from net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten by us, our affiliates and our licensees in exchange for up to $
150.0
 million in consideration, $
50.0
 million of which was paid on the closing date, $
50.0
 million of which was paid to us in March 2022 following the initiation of the first pivotal trial in oHCM for aficamten, and
 $
50.0
 million of which was paid to us in September 2023 following the initiation of the first pivotal clinical trial in nHCM for aficamten. Th
e RP Aficamten RPA also provides that the parties will negotiate terms for additional funding if we achieve proof of concept results in certain other indications for aficamten, with a reduction in the applicable royalty if we and RPI ICAV fail to agree on such terms in certain circumstances.
Pursuant to the RP Aficamten RPA, RPI ICAV purchased the right to receive a percentage of net sales equal to 
4.5
% for annual worldwide net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten up to $
1
 billion and 
3.5
% for annual worldwide net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten in excess of $
1
 billion, subject to reduction in certain circumstances. On May 22, 2024, we entered into the RP Aficamten RPA Amendment to restructure the royalty so that RPI will now be entitled to receive 
4.5
% of the first $
5.0
 billion of worldwide annual  net sales of aficamten and 
1
% of any incremental annual worldwide net sales of aficamten by us and our licensees. Our liability to RPI ICAV is referred to as the “RP Aficamten Liability”.
We account for the RP Aficamten Liability as a liability primarily because we have significant continuing involvement in generating the related revenue stream from which the liability will be repaid. If and when aficamten is commercialized and royalties become due, we will recognize the portion of royalties paid to RPI ICAV as a decrease to the RP Aficamten Liability and a corresponding reduction in cash.
The carrying amount of the RP Aficamten Liability is based on our estimate of the future royalties to be paid to RPI ICAV over the life of the arrangement as discounted using an imputed rate of interest. In the second quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional $
33.3
 million to the carrying value related to the 2024 RPI Transactions entered into May 22, 2024. 
The imputed rate of interest on the carrying value of the RP Aficamten Liability was approximately 
23.5
%
 and 
24.8
%
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
2017 RP Omecamtiv Mecarbil Royalty Purchase Agreement
In February 2017, we entered into the RP OM RPA pursuant to which we sold a portion of our right to receive royalties from Amgen on future net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil to RPFT for a one-time payment of $
90
 million, which is non-refundable even if omecamtiv mecarbil is never commercialized. Concurrently, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with RPFT through which RPFT purchased 
875,656
 shares of the Company’s common stock for $
10.0
 million. We allocated the consideration and issuance costs on a relative fair value basis to our liability to RPFT related to sale of future royalties under the RP OM RPA (the “RP OM Liability”) and the common stock sold to RPFT, which resulted in the RP OM Liability being initially recognized at $
92.3
 million. The RP OM RPA, as amended, provides for the sale of a royalty to RPFT of 
5.5
% on worldwide net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil.
We account for the RP OM Liability as a liability primarily because we have significant continuing involvement in generating the related revenue stream from which the liability will be repaid. If and when omecamtiv mecarbil is commercialized and royalties become due, we will recognize the portion of royalties paid to RPFT as a decrease to the RP OM Liability and a corresponding reduction in cash.
The carrying amount of the RP OM Liability is based on our estimate of the future royalties to be paid to RPFT over the life of the arrangement as discounted using an imputed rate of interest. The excess of future estimated royalty payments over the $
92.3
 million of allocated proceeds, less issuance costs, is recognized as non-cash interest expense using the effective interest method. The imputed rate of interest on the carrying value of the RP OM Liability was approximately 
0.1
%
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Accounting for Revenue Participation Right Purchase Agreements
We periodically assess the amount and timing of expected royalty payments using a combination of internal projections and forecasts from external sources. To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than its original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the RP OM Liability and the RP Aficamten Liability and the effective interest rate.

There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments, a number of which are not within our control. The RP OM Liability and the RP Aficamten Liability are recognized using significant unobservable inputs. The estimates of future royalties requires the use of several assumptions such as: the probability of clinical success, the probability of regulatory approval, the estimated date of a product launch, estimates of eligible patient populations, estimates of prescribing behavior and patient compliance behavior, estimates of pricing, payor reimbursement and coverage, and sales ramp. A significant change in unobservable inputs could result in a material increase or decrease to the effective interest rate of the RP OM Liability and the RP Aficamten Liability.
We recorded $
50.0
 million of additional consideration associated with the 2022 RP Aficamten Royalty Purchase Agreement upon receipt of the cash in the third quarter of 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional $
33.3
 million to the carrying value related to the 2024 RPI Transactions entered in May 22, 2024.
We review our assumptions on a regular basis and our estimates may change in the future as we refine and reassess our assumptions.

RP Multi Tranche Term Loan

As of December 31, 2024, under the 2022 RP Loan Agreement, we are entitled to receive tranches 4 and 5 as described below.  
On May 22, 2024, we entered into the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement Amendment which provides for two tranches of additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $
225.0
 million
 as follows:
•
$
75.0
 million of tranche 4 term loans during the one year period following the receipt on or prior to September 30, 2024 of positive results from SEQUOIA-HCM, the Phase 3 trial for aficamten;
•
$
100.0
 million of tranche 5 term loans during the one year period following the acceptance by the FDA on or prior to March 31, 2025 of an NDA for aficamten, subject to the conditions to the tranche 4 term loans having occurred on or prior to September 30, 2024;
•
$
50.0
 million tranche 6 term loan, which was drawn on May 22, 2024; and
•
$
175.0
 million tranche 7 term loan drawable at Cytokinetics’ discretion within one year of a future FDA approval of aficamten in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy if such approval is obtained on or prior to December 31, 2025.
In December 2023, we announced positive topline results from SEQUOIA-HCM, the Phase 3 trial for aficamten. This entitled us to draw $
75.0
 million under tranche 4 at any time prior to April 3, 2025.

In November 2024, we announced that FDA has accepted our NDA for aficamten. 
This entitled us to draw $
100.0
 million under tranche 5 at any time prior to 
November 25, 2025.

We are contractually required to draw at least $
50.0
 million of either tranche 4 or tranche 5 prior to November 24, 2025.
Each term loan under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement matures on the 
10 year
 anniversary of the funding date for such term loan and is repayable in quarterly installments of principal, interest and fees commencing on the last business day of the seventh full calendar quarter following the calendar quarter of the applicable funding date for such term loan, with the aggregate amount payable in respect of each term loan (including interest and other applicable fees) equal to 
190
% of the principal amount of the term loan for the tranche 1, tranche 4, tranche 5, tranche 6, and tranche 7 term loans (such amount with respect to each term loan, “Final Payment Amount”). We account for amounts drawn under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement using the effective interest method.
The RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement and amendment contains embedded derivative features. The fair values of the embedded derivatives are based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of change of control, the probability of default, discount rates and other factors. We have bifurcated and recognized the embedded derivatives as Derivative Liabilities Measured at Fair Value as discussed below.

We may prepay the term loans in full (but not in part) at any time at our option by paying an amount equal to the unpaid portion of Final Payment Amount for the outstanding term loans under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement. In addition, the term loans under the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement are repayable in full at the option of either us or the lender in an amount equal to the unpaid portion of Final Payment Amount for the outstanding term loans upon a change of control of Cytokinetics.

Derivative Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
We have bifurcated and recognized the embedded derivatives in the RP Multi Tranche Loan Agreement. These embedded derivatives include repayment features based upon a change in control and default.

We recognize the derivative liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Each period, the fair value of the derivative liabilities will be recalculated and resulting gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the derivatives with non-credit components are recognized in income, while the change in fair value associated with credit components is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Estimating fair values of derivative instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors.

The fair values of the derivative liabilities is determined using the probability-weighted expected return method and the “with and without” method. The fair values are based on significant unobservable inputs, including the probability of change of control, the probability of default (less than 
10
%), discount rates (ranging from 
10
% to 
16
%
 as of December 31, 2024) and other factors.

Note 4 — Research and Development Arrangements
Collaboration for Commercialization of Omecamtiv in China
On December 20, 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Corxel
, or the Corxel OM License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Corxel an exclusive license to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in China and Taiwan. Under the terms of the Corxel OM License Agreement, we received a $
50.0
 million nonrefundable payment from Corxel comprised of a $
40.0
 million payment as consideration for the rights granted by us to Corxel and $
10.0
 million attributable to our having submitted to FDA an NDA for omecamtiv mecarbil.
 In December 2024, we entered into a mutual termination agreement with Corxel to terminate the Corxel OM License Agreement. Accordingly, all rights to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil have reverted to us.
Collaboration for Commercialization of Aficamten in China
On July 14, 2020, we entered into the Corxel Aficamten License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Corxel an exclusive license to develop and commercialize aficamten in China and Taiwan. On December 17, 2024, Corxel assigned all of its rights under our license and collaboration agreement to Sanofi. As a result of the Corxel assignment transaction with Sanofi, we received a $
15.0
 million non-refundable payment in connection with a modification of the original license prior to the assignment of Corxel’s rights under our license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of aficamten in China to Sanofi. We are also eligible to receive an additional $
10.0
 million payment from Corxel contingent on aficamten being approved in China and included on China's National Reimbursement Drug List.

Effective December 17, 2024, Sanofi has an exclusive license to develop and commercialize aficamten in China and Taiwan (the "Sanofi License Agreement"). T
he total maximum future development and commercial milestone payments achievable for development and commercial milestone events in the field of oHCM and nHCM are $
160.0
 million, of which we have already earned and received $
10.0
 million.
 We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low-to-high teens range on the net sales of pharmaceutical products containing aficamten in China and Taiwan, subject to certain reductions for generic competition, patent expiration and payments for licenses to third party patents.

The Sanofi License Agreement will, unless terminated earlier, continue on a market-by-market basis until expiration of the relevant royalty term.

Accounting for the License and Collaboration Agreements in China
We assessed the original arrangements of the Corxel License Agreements in accordance with ASC 606 and concluded that there was one performance obligation, for which the counterparty is a customer for the unit of account,
 relating to the license of functional intellectual property for each agreement. The performance obligation was satisfied, and we recognized the residual allocation of arrangement consideration as revenue of $
54.9
 million in 2021 for the Corxel OM License Agreement and $
36.5
 million in 2020 for the Corxel Aficamten License Agreement. Due to the nature of development, including the inherent risk of development and approval by regulatory authorities, we are unable to estimate if and when the development milestone payments could be achieved or become due and, accordingly, we consider the milestone payments to be fully constrained and exclude the milestone payments from the transaction price. 
For the other transactions in collaborative arrangements, consisting of research and development cost reimbursements, we recognize the research and development cost reimbursements as collaboration revenues in our consolidated statement of operations.
In 2024, we entered into an agreement to modify the Corxel Aficamten License Agreement. The $
15.0
 million up-front payment was recognized upon execution of the modification as all performance obligations were satisfied. The $
10.0
 million contingent payment to be earned upon aficamten being approved in China and included on China's National Reimbursement Drug List is constrained due to the significant uncertainty as of December 31, 2024.
Collaboration revenues from Corxel for 2024, 2023, and 2022 were 
$
3.3
 million
, 
$
1.3
 million
, and 
$
0.9
 million
, respectively, related to certain development cost reimbursements.

We had accounts receivable from Corxel of 
$
16.5
 million
 as of December 31, 2024 and 
$
0.3
 million
 as of December 31, 2023.
Collaboration for Commercialization of Aficamten in Japan
On November 19, 2024, we announced that we had entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Bayer Consumer Care AG, an affiliate of Bayer AG, for the exclusive development and commercialization of aficamten in Japan, subject to certain reserved development rights of Cytokinetics to continue the conduct certain clinical trials (the "Bayer License Agreement").

The Company received an upfront payment of €
50.0
 million (equivalent to $
52.4
 million) and is eligible to receive up to an additional €
90.0
 million upon the achievement of milestones through commercial launch. The Company is also eligible to receive up to €
490.0
 million in commercial milestone payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestones, and tiered royalties on net sales of aficamten in Japan.
Accounting for the License and Collaboration Agreement in Japan
We assessed the Bayer License Agreement under ASC 606 and concluded that there was one performance obligation, for which the counterparty is a customer for the unit of account, relating to the license of functional intellectual property. The €
50.0
 million (equivalent to $
52.4
 million) up-front payment received under this agreement was recorded as deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, as the technology transfer related to the license of functional intellectual property has not yet been satisfied. We expect to fulfill and satisfy the technology transfer in the first half of 2025. The agreement also includes additional milestone payments, including 
future milestone payments totaling up to an additional €
90.0
 million upon achievement of milestones through commercial launch. T
hese payments are constrained due to uncertainties related to regulatory and development progress and will be recognized as revenue only when it becomes probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to €
490.0
 million in commercial milestone payments based on the achievement of specific sales thresholds and tiered royalties on net sales of aficamten in Japan. 
The sales-based milestone payments, including royalties, will be recognized when the related sales occur under the sales and usage-based royalty exception of ASC 606 as these amounts have been determined to relate predominantly to the license.
As of December 31, 2024, we had deferred revenue of $
52.4
 million, which related to the up-front payment from the Bayer License Agreement.

We re-evaluate the probability of achievement of development milestones and any related constraints each reporting period. We will include consideration, without constraint, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.

Collaboration for development of reldesemtiv
The Company and Astellas entered into the Astellas FSRA Agreement on April 23, 2020. 
Under the Astellas FSRA Agreement, Astellas agreed to pay one-third of the out-of-pocket clinical development costs which may be incurred in connection with the Company’s Phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in ALS, up to a maximum contribution by Astellas of $
12.0
 million. On March 31, 2023, we announced that we would be discontinuing COURAGE-ALS, our Phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with ALS, and COURAGE-ALS OLE. As of December 31, 2023 we billed and collected the maximum contribution of $
12.0
 million from Astellas, and no further revenue is expected under this arrangement.
We had 
no
 revenue from Astellas in 
2024. Collaboration revenue from Astellas for 2023 and 2022 was 
$
2.7

, respectively, related to certain development cost reimbursement.
Note 5 — Fair Value Measurements
We value our financial assets and liabilities at fair value, defined as the price that would be received for assets when sold or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best information reasonably available. Accordingly, we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider the security issuers’ and the third-party issuers’ credit risk in our assessment of fair value.
We classify fair value based on the observability of those inputs using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement):
Level 1 — Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 — Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or through corroboration with observable market data; and
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs, for which there is little or no market data for the assets or liabilities, such as internally-developed valuation models.

Investments in corporate debt securities, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and U.S. Government agency securities are classified as Level 2 as they are valued

based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs obtained from various third-party data providers, including but not limited to benchmark yields, interest rate curves, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and reference data.

No
 credit losses on debt securities were recognized in the periods presented.
 In its evaluation to determine expected credit losses, management considered all available historical and current information, expectations of future economic conditions, the type of security, the credit rating of the security, and the size of the loss position, as well as other relevant information. The unrealized losses as of December 31, 2024
 are attributed to market interest rate changes and are not attributed to credit. The Company does not intend to sell, and is unlikely to be required to sell, any of these available-for-sale investments before their effective maturity or market price recovery.

Note 7 — Debt
Convertible Notes
On November 13, 2019, we issued $

 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes. On July 6, 2022, we issued $
540.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes and used approximately $
140.3
 million of the net proceeds from the offering of 2027 Notes and issued 
8,071,343
 shares of common stock to repurchase approximately $
116.9
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes pursuant to privately negotiated exchange agreements entered into with certain holders of the 2026 Notes concurrently with the pricing of the offering of the 2027 Notes. 
As of December 31, 2024, there remains
 $
21.1
 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes outstanding 
and $
540.0
 million of aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes outstanding.

The 2026 Notes are unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate of 
4.0
% per year,
 payable semi-annually on May 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2020
. The 2026 Notes will mature on 
November 15, 2026
, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed by us or converted at the option of the holders. We may redeem the 2026 Notes prior to the maturity date but we are not required to and 
no
 sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, based on an initial conversion rate of 
94.7811
 shares of 
common stock
 per $
1,000
 principal amount (which represents an initial conversion price of $
10.55
 per share).

The 2027 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and shares equal in right of payment with our other indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes. The 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 
3.5
% per year, 
payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2023
. The 2027 Notes will mature on 
July 1, 2027
, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 
The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, based on the applicable conversion rate(s). The initial conversion rate for the 2027 Notes is 
19.5783
 shares of our 
common stock
 per $
1,000
 principal amount of such Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
51.08
 per share.
The conversion rate for the 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture), we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change.

The 2026 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and from time to time, and, in the case of any partial redemption, on or before the 60th scheduled trading day before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date but only if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we may send the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we may send such notice
.

The 2026 Notes are convertible at December 31, 2024 at the option of the holder.

Holders of the 2027 Notes have the option to convert their convertible notes only in the following circumstances: (i) if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for at least 
20
 trading days within a 
30
-day period starting from the last trading day of the preceding quarter after September 30, 2022; (ii) within 
5
 consecutive business days following any 
10
 consecutive trading day period if the trading price per $
1,000
 principal amount of 2027 Notes during such period falls below 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock and the conversion rate; (iii) upon certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock outlined in the 2027 Indenture; (iv) upon our call for redemption of the 2027 Notes; and (v) from March 1, 2027, until the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
We may not redeem the 2027 Notes at our option at any time before July 7, 2025. The 2027 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to the “Partial Redemption Limitation” (as defined in the 2027 Indenture)), at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after July 7, 2025.

Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
On March 1, 2023, we entered into the Amended ATM Facility, with Cantor, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of the Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $
300.0
 million through Cantor, as sales agent. The Amended ATM Facility amends, restates and supersedes the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement dated as of March 6, 2019 between the Company and Cantor.
Cantor may sell the Common Stock by any method that is deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other trading market for our common stock. Cantor will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Common Stock from time to time, based upon instructions from us (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We will pay Cantor a commission of up to 
3.0
% of the aggregate gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Cantor under the Amended ATM Facility, and also have provided Cantor with customary indemnification rights.
In 2023, we issued 
5,016,170
 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $
164.2
 million under the Amended ATM Facility
. We issued 
1,237,460
 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $
93.6
 million under the Amended ATM Facility in 2024.
Performance Stock Units
In 2024, the Compensation Committee granted a total of 
458,357
 performance stock units ("PSUs") to certain employees with a grant date fair value ranging from 
$
47.04
 to $
63.75

per unit. The fair value of the PSUs was determined on the grant date based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock at such time. The PSU awards are subject to performance goals and will be earned as to a pre-determined fixed number of shares subject to the certification by the Compensation and Talent Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) that the Company has achieved one or more of the relevant performance goals, in each case vesting as to 
50
% of the earned shares on applicable Compensation Committee certification date and as to the remaining 
50
% of the earned shares following the one-year anniversary of the applicable Compensation Committee certification date.

In 2024, the Company recognized expense of 
$
7.6
 million
 for the PSUs. As of December 31, 2024, there was 
$
6.0
 million
 of unamortized stock-based compensation related to the portion of PSUs vesting that is deemed probable. The Company will assess the probability of achieving the performance conditions quarterly and the expense recognized will be adjusted accordingly.

We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future and use an expected dividend yield of zero. We do not estimate forfeitures in our stock-based compensation.
We measure compensation expense for restricted stock units at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the expense over the expected vesting period.

Operating Leases
In July 2019, we entered into the Oyster Point Lease of office and laboratory space at a facility located in South San Francisco, California, and we entered into amendments to the Oyster Point Lease in 2020 through 2024. The Oyster Point Lease commenced on 
March 31, 2021
 and
 has an expiration date of 
October 31, 2033
.

In January 2022, we entered into a series of lease agreements with the sub-landlord and landlord and leased an office space at a facility located in Radnor, Pennsylvania (the "Radnor Lease")
. The Radnor Lease commenced in 
September 2022
, when the leasehold improvements were substantially completed, and we gained control over the use of the underlying assets. The Radnor Lease has an expiration date of 
July 31, 2027

with 
one five-year option to extend the lease
.

The weighted-average remaining lease term of the operating leases was 
8.7
 years, 
9.7
 years, and 
10.7
 years as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate used to determine the related operating lease liabilities was

 as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Cash paid for operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was 
$
26.1

, 
$
17.8
 million
, and 
$
24.1

, respectively, and was included in net cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Finance Leases
During the third quarter of 2021, we entered into a master lease agreement for laboratory equipment leases that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2021. The leases commenced through the second quarter of 2022, with the lease term ending in the fourth quarter of 2026. The master lease agreement provides a purchase option with a bargain purchase price, which we expect to exercise at the end of the term. The Company classified the leases as finance leases.
Finance leases are accounted for on the consolidated balance sheets with right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities, respectively. The finance lease cost is recognized as a combination of the amortization expense for the right-of-use assets calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
five-year
 estimated useful life for laboratory equipment and interest expense for the outstanding lease liabilities using the determined discount rates.

As of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term for the finance leases is 
2.0
 years, 
3.0
 years, and 
4.0

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception, expected future losses, and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results and an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

In general, under Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an ‘ownership change’ is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The bill was meant to address the high inflation rate in the United States through various climate, energy, healthcare, and other incentives. These incentives are meant to be paid for by the tax provisions included in the IRA, such as a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax, a 1 percent new excise tax on stock buybacks, additional IRS funding to improve taxpayer compliance, and others. The IRA provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. At this time, none of the IRA tax provisions are expected to have a material impact to our consolidated tax provision for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Company will continue to closely monitor any effects from future legislation.
In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”)/G20 finalized the significant components of a two-pillar global tax reform plan, which has now been agreed to by the majority of OECD members. Pillar Two requires multinational enterprises with annual global revenue exceeding €
750
 million to pay a global minimum tax of 
15

750
 million revenue threshold. The Company will continue to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two framework and the implementation of the Pillar Two rules in the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, and interim principal financial officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, we are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As required by Rule 13a‑15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a‑15(e) and 15d‑15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Based on the above evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Ernst & Young LLP is included below.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a‑15(d) and 15d‑15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Cytokinetics, Incorporated

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Cytokinetics, Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Cytokinetics, Incorporated (the “Company”) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
