Overview 
We are a clinical-stage vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. We are developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. We are re-engineering the way highly complex vaccines are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF™ cell-free protein synthesis platform, exclusively licensed from Sutro Biopharma, Inc. (“Sutro Biopharma”). Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, our system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate our ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. 
Our pipeline includes:
•
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (“PCV”) candidates that we believe are among the broadest-spectrum PCV candidates currently in development, targeting the approximately $8 billion global pneumococcal vaccine market. Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae 
bacteria. It can result in invasive pneumococcal disease (“IPD”), including meningitis and bacteremia, and non-invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis. Our broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing PCV candidates, VAX-31 and VAX-24, are designed to improve upon the standard-of-care PCVs for both adults and children by covering the serotypes that are responsible for a significant portion of IPD in circulation and are associated with high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and meningitis, while maintaining coverage of previously circulating strains that are currently contained through continued vaccination practice. 
◦
PCV Franchise Adult Indication:
▪
VAX-31 is a 31-valent, broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing investigational PCV being developed for the prevention of IPD. VAX-31 is the broadest-spectrum PCV in the clinic, and has the potential to provide protection against both currently circulating and historically prevalent serotypes. VAX-31 was designed to increase coverage, in a single vaccine, to more than 95% of IPD circulating in adults in the United States aged 50 and older, with the potential to provide an incremental 12-40% of coverage over current standard-of-care adult PCVs.
•
In September 2024, we announced positive topline results from a Phase 1/2 study of VAX-31 in adults. The VAX-31 Phase 1/2 clinical study was a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled, dose-finding clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single injection of VAX-31 at three dose levels (low, middle and high) and compared to Prevnar 20
® 
("PCV20") in 1,015 healthy adults aged 50 and older. In the low, middle and high doses, all serotypes were dosed at 1.1mcg, 2.2mcg and 3.3mcg, respectively, except serotypes 1, 5 and 22F, which were dosed at 1.65mcg, 3.3mcg, and 4.4mcg, respectively. The Phase 1 portion of the study included 64 healthy adults 50 to 64 years of age and the Phase 2 portion included 951 healthy adults 50 years of age and older. The immunogenicity objectives of the study included an assessment of the induction of antibody responses at Month 1, based on opsonophagocytic activity (“OPA”) and immunoglobulin G ("IgG"), at each of the

three VAX-31 doses and compared to PCV20 for the 20 serotypes in common, as well as for the additional 11 serotypes contained in VAX-31, but not in PCV20. 
In the Phase 1/2 study, VAX-31 was observed to be well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile at all doses studied through the full six-month evaluation period similar to PCV20. VAX-31 showed robust OPA immune responses for all 31 serotypes at all doses studied. At the middle and high doses, VAX-31 met or exceeded the regulatory immunogenicity criteria for all 31 serotypes and, at the low dose, for 29 of 31 serotypes. At the VAX-31 high dose, average OPA immune responses were greater for 18 of 20 serotypes compared to PCV20 (geometric mean ratio (“GMR”) greater than 1.0), with seven of these serotypes achieving statistically higher immune responses compared to PCV20. At the middle dose, 13 of 20 serotypes had a GMR greater than 1.0 and five serotypes achieved statistically higher immune responses compared to PCV20. At the low dose, 18 of 20 serotypes met the OPA response non-inferiority criteria, 8 of 20 serotypes had a GMR greater than 1.0 and three serotypes achieved statistically higher immune responses. For all 11 incremental serotypes unique to VAX-31, and not in PCV20, all three doses met the superiority criteria.
Based on these positive results, we selected VAX-31 to advance to an adult Phase 3 program, and plan to select the dose prior to the initiation of such program. Following an FDA End-of-Phase 2 meeting, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 pivotal, non-inferiority study by mid-2025 and announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from this study in 2026. We plan to initiate the remaining Phase 3 studies in 2025 and 2026 and announce data from those studies in 2026 and 2027.
•
In November 2024, we announced that the FDA granted a breakthrough therapy designation ("BTD") for VAX-31 in adults. 
◦
PCV Franchise Pediatric Indication:
▪
VAX-24 is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing investigational PCV being developed for the prevention of IPD in infants, and it covers more serotypes than any pneumococcal infant vaccine on the market today.
•
In March 2023, we announced that the first participants were dosed in the first stage of a Phase 2 study of VAX-24 in healthy infants. The Phase 2 infant study is being conducted in two stages and compares VAX-24 to the broadest-spectrum standard-of-care PCVs currently available. Stage 1 of the study evaluated the safety and tolerability of a single injection of VAX-24 at three dose levels, 1.1mcg, 2.2mcg and 2.2mcg/4.4mcg, and compared to VAXNEUVANCE
TM 
(“PCV15”), the broadest-spectrum standard-of-care PCV at that time, in 48 infants in a dose-escalation approach.
•
In July 2023, we announced that the Phase 2 study of VAX-24 in healthy infants had advanced to the second and final stage of the study. An independent data safety monitoring board ("DSMB") approved advancing to the second stage of the study following the review of the safety and tolerability results from the first stage. Additionally, in agreement with the FDA, we amended the study protocol for Stage 2 of the study, changing the study comparator to PCV20, which became the broadest-spectrum PCV recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) in June 2023. This Phase 2 study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-24 in healthy infants at the same three dose levels, 1.1mcg, 2.2mcg and 2.2mcg/4.4mcg, that were evaluated in Stage 1. Per ACIP guidelines, the primary immunization series includes three doses given at two months, four months and six months of age, followed by a booster dose at 12-15 months of age. 
•
In March 2024, we announced the completion of enrollment in the VAX-24 Phase 2 study in infants. A total of 802 healthy infants (48 from stage 1 and 754 from Stage 2) were enrolled. We expect to announce topline safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from the Phase 2 primary three-dose immunization series by the end of the first quarter 2025, followed by topline data from the booster dose by the end of 2025.

.
•
In December 2024, we announced that the first participants were dosed in the first stage of a Phase 2 study of VAX-31 in infants. Stage 1 of the study evaluated the safety and tolerability of VAX-31 at three dose levels (low, middle and high) and compared to PCV20 in 48 infants in a dose-escalation approach. In the low, middle and high doses, all serotypes were dosed at 1.1mcg, 2.2mcg and 3.3mcg, respectively, except serotypes 1, 5 and 22F, which were dosed at 1.65mcg, 3.3mcg, and 4.4mcg, respectively. Participants who received VAX-31 in Stage 1 will continue the standard dosing regimen as part of Stage 2 and will be included in the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity analysis of the study. 
•
In February 2025, we announced that the Phase 2 study of VAX-31 in healthy infants had advanced to the second and final stage of the study. Stage 2 of the study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VAX-31 at the same three dose levels evaluated in Stage 1 and compared to PCV20 in approximately 750 infants. In line with recommendations from the ACIP, the study design includes a primary immunization series consisting of three doses given at two months, four months and six months of age, followed by a subsequent booster dose at 12-15 months of age. We expect to share topline data from the primary three-dose immunization series of the study in mid-2026, followed by topline data from the booster dose approximately nine months later.
•
VAX-A1, a novel conjugate vaccine candidate designed to prevent disease caused by Group A Streptococcus (“Group A Strep”). Group A Strep is pervasive globally and causes an estimated 800 million cases of illness annually, including pharyngitis, or strep throat, and certain severe invasive infections and sequelae. There is currently no vaccine against Group A Strep, which is one of the leading infectious disease-related causes of death and disability worldwide and a significant contributor to the prescription of antibiotics in children. We believe we have demonstrated preclinical proof of concept for VAX-A1, the data for which were published in December 2020. We nominated the final vaccine candidate for VAX-A1 in the first quarter of 2021 and initiated Investigational New Drug ("IND")-enabling activities in the second half of 2021. We continue to advance the development of VAX-A1 and we intend to provide further information about the anticipated timing of an IND application as the program progresses.
•
VAX-PG, a novel protein vaccine candidate targeting the keystone pathogen responsible for periodontitis, a chronic oral inflammatory disease affecting an estimated 65 million adults in the United States. We believe we have generally demonstrated preclinical proof of concept for a periodontitis protein vaccine, the data for which was published in February 2019. We nominated a final vaccine candidate for VAX-PG in 2022 and are conducting large-animal confirmatory studies prior to advancing the program to potential IND-enabling activities. Our initial goal is to develop a therapeutic vaccine to slow or stop disease progression; however, the results from clinical trials may inform the potential adoption of prophylactic immunization. 
•
VAX-GI, a novel preclinical vaccine candidate being developed as a preventative treatment for dysentery and shigellosis, which is caused by Shigella bacteria. Shigella is a bacterial illness estimated to cause 80 million to 165 million cases of disease and 600,000 deaths annually, mostly among children. The central antigen in VAX-GI is IpaB, a well-appreciated antigen that other developers have been unable to produce in an amount sufficient to enable a commercial product. With our cell-free technology, we believe we can produce this antigen at substantially improved yields, allowing for commercial-scale production. VAX-GI is being developed in collaboration with the University of Maryland, Baltimore as well as with partial funding from two research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”). 
•
Other discovery-stage programs that leverage our cell-free protein synthesis platform, which, if proven successful in preclinical studies, could also be advanced into IND-enabling activities and clinical studies.

In July 2024, the NIAID awarded a five-year, $9.5 million grant to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Vaxcyte and the University of Chicago to develop a vaccine candidate for the prevention of Chlamydia. There is a significant need for a vaccine to protect against Chlamydia. It is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide, with nearly 130 million new cases per year. While it is treatable when detected early, it can cause permanent damage to the female reproductive system, potentially leading to complications such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy.  
•
Appointed John Furey to Board of Directors: 
In July 2024, we appointed John Furey to our Board of Directors. Mr. Furey is an accomplished biopharmaceutical executive with over 30 years of experience developing and implementing operational strategies and leading commercial and technical teams, including senior leadership roles in the U.S., Europe and Asia. He currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Imvax, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel immunotherapies for cancer. 
Since our inception in November 2013, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development, undertaking preclinical studies, advancing our vaccine candidates through clinical trials, enabling manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, acquiring and developing our technology and vaccine candidates, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and raising capital to support and expand such activities. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase our common stock and, prior to our initial public offering (“IPO”) in June 2020, redeemable convertible preferred stock. We will continue to require additional capital to develop and commercialize our vaccine candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our vaccine candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party (including government) funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches.
We have incurred net losses in each year since inception and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending in large part on the timing of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities, and our expenditures on other research and development activities. Our net losses were $463.9 million, $402.3 million and $223.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,388.3 million and cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3,134.7 million. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
We do not expect to generate any revenue from commercial product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our vaccine candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. We expect our expenses and capital expenditures will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 
•
advance our vaccine candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
progress in the scale-up of our manufacturing capabilities, in particular to prepare for the potential commercial launches of VAX-31 in the adult population and VAX-31 and/or VAX-24 in the pediatric population;
•
incur additional costs that may be required for secondary supply sources;
•
require the manufacture of supplies for our clinical trials;
•
conduct clinical trials, in particular VAX-31 and VAX-24; 
•
pursue regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates; 
•
establish additional manufacturing capacity to meet potential incremental supply requirements following the potential initial commercial launch of VAX-31 in adults;
•
hire additional personnel; 
103
Table
 of 
Contents

•
expand our facilities to support our growing workforce and lab activities; 
•
acquire, discover, validate and develop additional vaccine candidates; and 
•
obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio. 
We rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and for manufacturing and supply of our vaccine candidates. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, of which the main suppliers are single-source suppliers, for our preclinical and clinical trial materials. Given our stage of development, we do not yet have a marketing or sales organization or commercial infrastructure. Accordingly, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our vaccine candidates, we also would expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. 
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with vaccine development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our vaccines, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.
