Item 2. Properties. 
Our corporate headquarters is located in San Carlos, California, where we currently lease and occupy 125,584 square feet of laboratory and office space pursuant to an Amended and Restated Lease Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Lease”). Our Amended and Restated Lease premises consist of an aggregate of approximately 258,581 square feet of laboratory and office space, of which (i) 16,731 square feet we currently sublet, and (ii) 116,266 square feet of which the lease commencements will begin starting in late 2025 through 2026. Our Amended and Restated Lease expires on February 28, 2035. We use our corporate headquarters primarily for corporate research, development, regulatory, manufacturing and quality functions. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs.
