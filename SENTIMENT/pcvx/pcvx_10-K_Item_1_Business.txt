Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Purchase Commitments 
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CMOs and other vendors for manufacturing services and raw materials purchases. We rely on several third-party manufacturers for our manufacturing requirements. As of December 31, 2024, we had the following amounts of non-cancelable purchase commitments related to manufacturing services and raw materials purchased due to our key manufacturing partners. These amounts represent our minimum contractual obligations, including termination fees. If we terminate certain firm orders with key manufacturing partners, we will be required to pay for the manufacturing services scheduled or raw materials purchased under our arrangements. The actual amounts we pay in the future to our vendors under such agreements may differ from the purchase order amounts.

ATM Program
In July 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sales Agreement℠ (the “Original ATM Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”) to issue and sell, from time to time at our discretion, shares of our common stock at an aggregate offering price up to $
150.0
 million through Jefferies acting as our sales agent or principal, however, we are not obligated to make any sales of common stock. As of February 27, 2023, we had sold 
4,995,709
 shares of our common stock under the Original ATM Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of $
27.57
 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $
137.8
 million. On February 27, 2023, we and Jefferies entered into an amendment to the Original ATM Sales Agreement (as amended, the “Amended ATM Sales Agreement”) to offer and sell additional shares of our common stock with an aggregate offering price up to another $
400.0
 million, which is in addition to the $
150.0
 million aggregate offering price under the Original ATM Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold 
4,211,367
 shares of our common stock under the Amended ATM Sales Agreement at a weighted average price of $
64.19
 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $
270.3
 million, or $
264.2
 million net of commissions and offering expenses, with $
129.7
 million remaining for future sales under the Amended ATM Sales Agreement. The gross proceeds of the shares sold net of commission and related offering expenses are reflected as an addition to common stock and additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheets.

2,500,000
 shares of our common stock at a price of $

 per underlying share. Each pre-funded warrant has an exercise price of $
0.001
 per share. In February 2022, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional

 shares of common stock. In aggregate, we received $
107.6
 million in net proceeds after deducting issuance costs, and excluding the exercise of any pre-funded warrants. 
On October 28, 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of

On September 6, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of

1.4
 billion in net proceeds after deducting issuance costs, and excluding the exercise of any pre-funded warrants.
The pre-funded warrants are exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice and payment of the exercise price. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the exercise of a pre-funded warrant. The holders of the pre-funded warrants may also satisfy their obligation to pay the exercise price through a “cashless exercise,” in which the holder receives the net value of the pre-funded warrant in shares of common stock determined according to the formula set forth in the pre-funded warrant.
The pre-funded warrants will not expire until they are fully exercised. However, we may not effect the exercise of any pre-funded warrants, and a holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any pre-funded warrants that, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause: (i) the aggregate number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by such holder (together with affiliates) to exceed 
4.99
% or 
9.99
% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as applicable; or (ii) the combined voting power of our securities beneficially owned by such holder (together with its affiliates) to exceed 
4.99
% or 
9.99
% of the combined voting power of all of our securities outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as applicable, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants. However, any holder of a pre-funded warrant may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 
19.99
% upon at least 61 days' prior notice for the holder to us. As of December 31, 2024, 
no
 shares underlying the pre-funded warrants had been exercised.
9. 
Equity Incentive Plans 
Equity Incentive Plans
Our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”) became effective in June 2020 and replaced our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (“2014 Plan”). Under the 2020 Plan, we may grant stock options, appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, or any other award to employees, consultants and directors. Stock options granted under the 2020 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be granted only to our employees, including officers and directors who are also employees. Nonqualified stock options may be granted to our employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors. 
Awards granted under our 2020 Plan vest over the periods determined by our Board, generally 
three
 to 
four years
 from the date of grant, and our options expire no more than 
10
 years after the date of grant. 
We net-share settle equity awards held by certain employees by withholding shares upon vesting to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The shares withheld to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations are returned to our 2020 Plan and will be available for future issuance. Payments for employees’ tax obligations to the tax authorities are recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and reflected as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
A total of 
10,150,000
 shares of common stock were approved to be initially reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan. The number of shares that remained available for issuance under the 2014 Plan as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan, and shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan as of the effective date of the 2020 Plan that are subsequently canceled, forfeited or repurchased by us, will be added to the shares reserved under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan is automatically increased on the first day of each calendar year during the 
10
-year term of the 2020 Plan, beginning with January 1, 2021 and ending with January 1, 2030, by an amount equal to 
5
% of the outstanding number of shares of our common stock on December 31 of the preceding calendar year or such lesser amount as determined by our Board. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of 
8,796,806
 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. Effective January 1, 2025, the number of shares of common stock available under the 2020 Plan increased by 
6,244,651
 shares pursuant to the evergreen provision of the 2020 Plan.
As of December 31, 2024, 
1,209,840
 shares and 
10,213,591
 shares of common stock were subject to outstanding options and RSUs under the 2014 Plan and 2020 Plan, respectively.

Stock Option Activity
In November 2024, we granted 
639,710
 performance contingent stock options ("PCSOs") with both service and market conditions to certain employees. The market condition relates to the achievement of a share price threshold that requires the average price of our common stock to be equal to or greater than $
154.05
 for a period of one calendar year. To the extent that the market conditions are met, one-third of the PCSOs vest on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary date of the grant date, subject to continued service. The maximum contractual term of our outstanding PCSOs is 
10
 years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2024, the market condition for the PCSOs has not been met. 
No
 PCSOs were granted in the year ended December 31, 2023.
Stock option activity under our 2020 Plan and 2014 Plan, which excludes options to purchase

RSU Activity
In March 2022, our Board authorized the issuance of RSUs under our 2020 Plan and adopted a form of Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the “RSU Agreement”), which is intended to serve as a standard form agreement for RSU grants issued to employees. 
In November 2024, we granted 
175,513
 shares of performance-based stock units ("PSUs"), which contain service and market conditions to certain employees. Subject to continuous service requirements, the market condition is measured based on our total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of our peer group comprised in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index over a period of 
four years
.

2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In June 2020, our Board adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2020 ESPP”), which became effective on June 11, 2020. The 2020 ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 
15
% of their eligible compensation. Employees enrolled in the 2020 ESPP purchase shares of common stock at a price per share equal to 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value at the start or end of the 
six-month
 purchase periods within the 
two-year
 offering period. A total of 
650,000
 shares of common stock were approved to be initially reserved for issuance under the 2020 ESPP. In addition, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2020 ESPP is automatically increased on the first day of each calendar year during the 
10
-year term of the 2020 Plan, beginning with January 1, 2021 and ending with January 1, 2030, by an amount of 
1
% of the outstanding number of shares of our common stock on December 31 of the preceding calendar year or such lesser amount as determined by our Board. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, employees purchased 
90,517
, 
76,275
, and 
61,709
 shares of common stock through our 2020 ESPP, at an average price of $
38.60
, $
26.71
, and $
16.75
 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 
2,167,228
 shares of our common stock remain available for future issuance under our 2020 ESPP.
Stock-based Compensation 
The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes options pricing model for stock options and ESPP; and the Monte Carlo simulation model for PCSOs and PSUs to estimate our stock-based compensation expense, respectively.

Funding Arrangement
Our vaccine development program for VAX-A1, a novel conjugate vaccine candidate designed to prevent disease caused by Group A Streptococcus, has been funded in part by a grant obtained from Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (“CARB-X”), a global non-profit partnership dedicated to accelerating antibacterial innovation to tackle the rising global threat of drug-resistant bacteria. The CARB-X grant provided funding of $
11.7
 million upon the achievement of VAX-A1 development milestones through June 2024. As of the second quarter of 2024, all of these milestones had been successfully achieved, and no further amounts will be funded under this CARB-X grant.
Our vaccine development program for VAX-GI, a novel preclinical vaccine candidate being developed as a preventative treatment for dysentery and shigellosis, which is caused by Shigella bacteria, is currently funded in part by two grants obtained from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) administered by the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Our first grant from the NIH was awarded in April 2021 and provides for potential funding up to 
five years
 totaling approximately

$
0.5
 million. In June 2023, we received another grant from the NIH that provides for potential funding up to 
five years
 totaling approximately $
4.6
 million. We have received and expect to continue to receive funding under each of these grants.
We are currently working on a discovery program with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Chicago to develop a vaccine candidate for the prevention of Chlamydia, which is funded in part by a grant from the NIAID that provides potential funding up to 
five years
 totaling approximately $
9.5
 million
.
 As of December 31, 2024, we have not yet received funding under this award. 

Income from grants is recognized in the period during which the related specified expenses are incurred, provided that the conditions under which the grants were provided have been met. We recognized $
1.0
 million, $
4.8
 million and $
1.9
 million of grant income and recorded the amounts in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A grant receivable of $
0.4
 million representing unreimbursed, eligible costs incurred under the agreements was recorded and included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024. There was 
no
 such grant receivable balance as of December 31, 2023.

Our pre-tax book loss was primarily derived from our business operations within the United States. 
The Company has not recognized a current or deferred tax expense/(benefit) for federal, state or foreign jurisdictions in the years ending December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to tax losses in the various jurisdictions.

At December 31, 2024, we have net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $
430.2
 million and $
1,188.1
 million available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal and state NOL carryforwards, except the federal loss carryforward arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, begin to expire in 2034 unless previously utilized. Federal NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryover period and do not expire. The Company’s state NOL carryforward generally have a 
twenty-year
 carryover period.

At December 31, 2024, we have research credit carryforwards of $
28.3
 million and $
8.1
 million available to offset future income tax liabilities, if any, for federal and California income tax purposes, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in 2039 unless previously utilized. The California tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. 
Utilization of the NOL and research credit carryforward may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership percentage change limitations under Section 382 and Section 383, respectively, provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the NOL before utilization. We have experienced ownership changes in the past. There were no ownership changes identified in 2024, as such we determined that no federal research credits will expire unutilized or are excluded from our research credit carryforwards. Subsequent ownership changes may affect the limitation in future years.
We have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Based on our history of operating losses, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we have provided a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  
We have uncertain tax benefits (“UTBs”) totaling $
9.5
 million and $
4.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were netted against deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance. The UTBs had no effect on the effective tax rate. We recognize interest and penalties related to UTBs, when they occur, as a component of income tax expense. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made. There were 
no
 interest or penalties recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. We do not expect our UTBs to change significantly over the next 12 months.

We file U.S. federal, state and foreign tax returns in certain jurisdictions in which we operate as required. In general, we are no longer subject to tax examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authorities for years before 2019. Although the federal and state statutes are closed for purposes of assessing additional income tax in those prior years, the taxing authorities may still make adjustments to the NOL and credit carryforwards used in open years. Therefore, the tax statutes should be considered open as it relates to the NOL and credit carryforwards used in open years. Our Swiss corporate income and capital tax returns are subject to examination by the Swiss tax authorities for five years after the end of the corresponding tax period. We do not have any tax audits or other issues pending.
It is our intention to reinvest the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiary in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the United States. Accordingly, we do not provide for deferred taxes on differences between financial reporting and tax basis in our investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration or are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2024, there are no unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiary.

Segment Reporting
We operate and manage our business as 
one
 reportable and operating segment. Our chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance based on consolidated net loss, as is reported in our consolidated statements of operations.
Our long-lived assets are based in the United States and Switzerland. Long-lived assets are comprised of property and equipment. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, property and equipment based in the United States was $
40.8
 million and $
79.6
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, property and equipment based in Switzerland was $
157.2

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None. 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Office (“CEO”) and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”) as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024 were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is included below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Vaxcyte, Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Vaxcyte, Inc. and its subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
