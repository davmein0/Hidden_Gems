ITEM 2.   
  PROPERTIES

The Company’s main office, which is the headquarters of the holding company, is located at Hancock Whitney Plaza, in Gulfport, Mississippi. The Bank makes portions of the main office facilities and certain other facilities available for lease to third parties, although such incidental leasing activity is not material to the Company’s overall operations.

The Company operates 180 full-service banking and financial services offices and 223 automated teller machines across our market, primarily in the Gulf south corridor, including southern and central Mississippi; southern and central Alabama; southern, central and northwest Louisiana; the northern, central, and panhandle regions of Florida; and certain areas of east and northeast Texas. Additionally, the Company operates combined loan and deposit production offices in the metropolitan areas of Nashville, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia. The Company owns over 75% of these facilities, and the remaining banking facilities are subject to leases, each of which we consider reasonable and appropriate for its location. We ensure that all properties, whether owned or leased, are maintained in suitable condition. We also evaluate our banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under-utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements, relocations, closures or possible sales. The Bank and its subsidiaries hold a variety of property interests acquired in settlement of loans. Some of these properties were acquired in transactions before 1979 and are carried at nominal amounts on our balance sheet and reflected income of $0.1 million in our 2024 operating results.

ITEM 7
. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The objective of this discussion and analysis is to provide material information relevant to the assessment of the financial condition and results of operations of Hancock Whitney Corporation and its subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2024 and selected prior periods, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and outside sources. This discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement financial and operating data and information presented elsewhere in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include non-GAAP measures used to describe our performance. A reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures are provided in Table 1 “Consolidated Financial Results” and Table 31 “Quarterly Consolidated Financial Results” of this section. The following is an overview of the non-GAAP measures used and the reasons why management believes they are useful and important in understanding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations included below.

Consistent with the provisions of Subpart 229.1400 of Regulation S-K, “Disclosures by Bank and Savings and Loan Registrants,” we present net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratios on a fully taxable equivalent (te) basis. The te basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of interest income from certain loans and investments using the statutory federal tax rate (21% for all periods presented) to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. This measure is the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

We present certain additional non-GAAP financial measures to assist the reader with a better understanding of the Company’s performance period over period, as well as to provide investors with assistance in understanding the success management has experienced in executing its strategic initiatives. The Company highlights certain items that are outside of our principal business and/or are not indicative of forward-looking trends in supplemental disclosure items below our GAAP financial data and presents certain “Adjusted” ratios that exclude these disclosed items. These adjusted ratios provide management and the reader with a measure that may be more indicative of forward-looking trends in our business, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains or losses and changes.

We define 
Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue
 as net income excluding provision expense and income tax expense, plus the taxable equivalent adjustment (as defined above), less supplemental disclosure items (as defined above). Management believes that adjusted pre-provision net revenue is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. We define 
Adjusted Revenue
 as net interest income (te) and noninterest income less supplemental disclosure items. We define 
Adjusted Noninterest Expense
 as noninterest expense less supplemental disclosure items. We define our 
Efficiency Ratio 
as noninterest expense to total net interest income (te) and noninterest income, excluding amortization of purchased intangibles and supplemental disclosure items, if applicable. Management believes adjusted revenue, adjusted noninterest expense and the efficiency ratio are useful measures as they provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability with prior periods.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

The discussions and analyses that follow provide insight into the impact of macroeconomic and industry trends on our performance in the most recent fiscal year, and our outlook for the near term.

Current Economic Environment

While the presidential and congressional elections came to the forefront of the economic and social landscape later in the year, progress in the fight against inflation, continued robust economic activity, softening in the labor market and the eventual shift in policy of the Federal Reserve drove much of the economic headlines during the year ended December 31, 2024. Economic activity remained resilient in 2024, with real gross domestic product (GDP) displaying healthy growth of 2.8% for the year, relatively consistent with the prior year and in excess of expectations. While the labor market remained strong overall, employment statistics began to migrate during the year. By mid-year, it seemed that the Federal Reserve
’
s stated inflation target of 2% was in range, and, in September, the Federal Reserve issued a 50 basis point (bp) rate cut, indicating its shift in focus to preserving a healthy labor market. Two additional 25 bp rate cuts followed in November and December. However, the upward trend in inflation markers in December coupled with concerns over the potential fiscal impacts of the current administration’s policy actions, particularly around tariffs and immigration, have somewhat clouded the picture surrounding monetary policy expectations. Longer-term interest rates experienced some volatility

Table of Contents

as the market responded to mixed data on both inflation and employment throughout the year. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ranged from below 4% to 4.7% ending the year at 4.6%, affecting bond indices and mortgage rates and other capital market indicators.

Within the financial services industry, some of the headwinds experienced in much of the previous year began to ease. While interest rates remain elevated and continue to influence loan demand and deposit behavior, negative sentiment from recent high profile bank failures has receded, and funding costs that had begun to stabilize in late 2023 further benefited from rate cuts in the latter half of 2024. Within our markets, loan growth remains tempered due in part to loan demand, the credit health of borrowers, and a strategic reduction of exposure to syndicated credits as we focus on full-service relationships. However, interest rates on new, renewed and repricing variable rate loans and investment securities continue to result in higher yields on earning assets that, coupled with stabilization in funding costs, contributed to net interest margin expansion throughout the year.

Economic Outlook

We utilize economic forecasts produced by Moody’s Analytics (Moody’s) that provide various scenarios to assist in the development of our economic outlook. This outlook discussion utilizes the December 2024 Moody’s forecast, the most current available at December 31, 2024. The forecasts are anchored on a baseline forecast scenario, which Moody’s defines as the “most likely outcome” of where the economy is headed based on current conditions. Several upside and downside scenarios are produced that are derived from the baseline scenario and incorporate varying degrees of favorable and unfavorable adjustments to economic indicators and circumstances as compared to the baseline. The macroeconomic variables underlying the December 2024 economic scenarios differ in many respects from the comparable forecasts available at December 31, 2023, given the shift in economic circumstances and risks, particularly as a result of the outcome of the 2024 presidential and congressional elections.

The baseline scenario continues to maintain an overall optimistic tenor with respect to economic outcomes. The forecast reflects new assumptions about fiscal policy, monetary policy and immigration and population growth given the Republican sweep of the White House and Congress. Key assumptions within the December 2024 baseline forecast include the following: (1) With the Republican majority, spending will decrease, personal income tax provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be extended and the corporate income tax rate will decrease to 15%; (2) The Federal Reserve will issue two rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2025, with further gradual reductions in 2026 until the benchmark rate reaches 3%; (3) Though the labor market has softened, the economy remains near full-employment with the current unemployment rate of 4%, and is forecasted to remain relatively stable at 4.1% over the succeeding three years; (4) GDP will display modest annual below-trend growth in the coming years of 2.2% in 2025, 1.6% in 2026, and 1.8% in 2027; and, (5) the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will remain elevated near its current rate, and is forecasted to average 4.3% for 2025 through 2027 and only gradually decline through the end of the decade.

The S-2 scenario presents a downside alternative to the baseline. The S-2 scenario assumes the impacts of current administration tariffs and deportations on the economy are worse than expected, elevated interest rates weaken credit-sensitive spending more than anticipated and there is longer and farther-reaching disturbance from geopolitical conflict. Further, the scenario assumes the unemployment rate will increase considerably to 6.3% in 2025 (peaking at 7.1% in the fourth quarter) before improving to 5.6% in 2026 and 4.1% in 2027. As a result of these pressures, the U.S. falls into a mild recession beginning in the first quarter of 2025 that lasts for three quarters, with the stock market contracting 22% and a peak-to-trough decline in GDP of 1.1%. Despite the onset of the recession, rising inflation prompts the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark rate in the first quarter of 2025 before resuming easement in the second quarter of 2025.

Management has deemed certain assumptions underlying the S-2 scenario to be somewhat more likely to occur in the near term than those underlying the baseline scenario, and as such, the baseline scenario and the S-2 scenario were given probability weightings of 40% and 60%, respectively, in the calculation of our allowance for credit losses calculation at December 31, 2024.

Recent and expected changes in fiscal and other policies with the current administration creates significant uncertainty as to the impact on the U.S and global economies. The effects of continued elevated inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s actions to counter those effects, as well as to respond to other economic concerns, could reduce economic growth in the near term. The full extent of the impact of these and other influential factors are uncertain and may have an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, including the possibility of an economic recession or slower growth in the near or midterm.

Highlights of 2024 Financial Results

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $460.8 million, or $5.28 per diluted common share, compared to $392.6 million, or $4.50 per diluted common share in 2023. Included in the results of the year ended December 31, 2024 is a charge of $3.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share after-tax, supplemental disclosure item attributable to a revision of the FDIC special assessment. Included in the results of the year ended December 31, 2023 is a net charge of $75.4 million (pre-tax), or $0.68 per share after tax, comprised of the following supplemental disclosure items: a $65.4 million loss on restructuring of the securities portfolio, a $26.1

million FDIC special assessment charge and a $16.1 million gain on the sale of a parking facility. The following is an overview of financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023:

•
Net income of $460.8 million, or $5.28 per diluted common share 

•
Adjusted pre-provision net revenue (a non-GAAP measure) totaled $641.0 million, up $5.3 million

•
Provision for credit losses of $52.2 million in 2024, compared to $59.1 million in 2023; allowance for credit losses to total loans remains strong at 1.47% at December 31, 2024, up 6 basis points

•
Loans of $23.3 billion, down $622.5 million; reflects a $307.6 million strategic reduction of the shared national credit portfolio

•
Deposits of $29.5 billion, down $197.2 million; reflects organic growth offset by a decline of $582.9 million in brokered deposits

•
Common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 14.14%, up 181 bps from December 31, 2023; tangible common equity ratio of 9.47%, up 110 bps

•
Criticized commercial loans and nonaccrual loans continued to normalize following the recent benign credit environment but remain comparable to peers; net charge-off ratio improved to 0.19% from 0.27%

•
Net interest margin expanded 3 bps to 3.37%

•
Efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP measure) of 55.36%, relatively consistent with 2023

Our results for the year ended December 31, 2024 represent a solid year of performance. Our net interest margin expanded, reflecting higher earning asset yields and stabilization in the cost of funds. Fee income grew and adjusted noninterest expense increased only modestly. Strong earnings facilitated substantial growth in our capital ratios. Though credit metrics normalized compared to the recent benign credit environment, we have not seen signs of significant weakening in any particular industry, sector or geographic segment, and we continue to maintain a robust allowance for credit loss coverage of 1.47% in light of the current credit and economic environment. We remain focused on balance sheet optimization and effective expense control, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to enhance shareholder value. As we close out our celebration of our 125th year, we are ready for the opportunities ahead, including our pending second quarter 2025 acquisition of Sabal Trust Company and the recently announced multi-year organic growth plan.

The table that follows presents our consolidated financial results. Additional information related to our results and outlook are included in the discussions that follow.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion of results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion of prior year variances.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $1.1 billion in 2024, down $15.7 million, or 1%, from 2023. Net interest income is the primary component of our earnings and represents the difference, or spread, between revenue generated from interest-earning assets and the interest expense related to funding those assets. For analytical purposes, net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis (te) using the statutory federal tax rate of 21% on tax exempt items (primarily interest on municipal securities and loans). Net interest income (te) was $1.1 billion in 2024, also down $15.7 million, or 1%, from 2023, and included an increase in interest income (te) of $72.5 million more than offset by an increase of $88.2 million in interest expense. Net interest margin, the ratio of net interest income (te) to average earning assets, increased 3 bps to 3.37% in 2024 from 3.34% in 2023.

The $72.5 million increase in interest income (te) is largely attributable to the sustained elevated interest rate environment, partially offset by a $738 million decrease in average earning assets. The yield on earning assets (te) was 5.26% in 2024, up 34 bps from 2023. Loan yield was up 30 bps to 6.17%, reflecting the impact of the new and repricing loans in the current interest rate environment. The yield on investment securities increased 24 bps in 2024 to 2.63% as new investments were made at higher yields. The decline in average earning assets included decreases of $680 million in investment securities and $91 million in short-term investments, while average total loans remained relatively flat, but experienced a shift in mix from commercial and consumer loans into residential mortgage.

The $88.2 million increase in interest expense was largely driven by the interest rate environment, as higher prevailing interest rates drove an increase in the cost of deposits and continued to foster shifts in deposit composition from noninterest-bearing and within the mix of interest-bearing deposits to higher-cost products, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings expense, mostly attributable to a decline in average Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Compared to the prior year, average noninterest-bearing deposits were down $1.4 billion, while higher-cost time deposits were up $857.8 million. Average short-term borrowings in 2024 were down $802.0 million from 2023, as the incremental FHLB borrowings drawn as a cautionary measure in early 2023 were repaid. Our total cost of funds increased 30 bps to 1.88% in 2024 from 1.58% in 2023, largely driven by higher interest-bearing deposit costs, up 55 bps in 2024 to 3.08% from 2.53% in 2023, and other short-term borrowing costs, which consist largely of FHLB advances, increasing 43 bps to 5.49% in 2024 from 5.06% in 2023.

Though interest rates remain elevated, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate three times during 2024, beginning in September. Our loan and interest-bearing deposits betas for the down rate cycle in the second half of the 2024 were 33% and 38%, respectively. We expect deposit costs to decline in the near term as promotional pricing has been reduced. We expect our net interest income (te) for 2025 to increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We expect modest and consistent expansion of net interest margin throughout 2025, with an emphasis on balance sheet growth and by proactively managing deposit costs as interest rates continue to decline. Our forecast assumes three 25 bp rate cuts occurring in July, September and December 2025. Modeling one and zero rate cut scenarios yielded modestly better results for the year.

Discussions of Asset/Liability Management and Net Interest Income at Risk later in this item provide additional information regarding our management of interest rate risk and the potential impact from changes in interest rates, respectively.

Provision for Credit Losses

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $52.2 million compared to $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses recorded in 2024 included net charge-offs of $46.0 million and a $6.1 million reserve build. The provision for credit losses recorded in 2023 included net charge-offs of $63.4 million and a reserve release of $4.3 million. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included a $29.7 million charge-off attributable to a single participation in a shared national credit.

The modest reserve build in 2024 is the result of a higher allowance for credit loss coverage to total loans, reflecting the impact of prolonged elevated interest rates and inflation and other market conditions.

Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $46.0 million, or 0.19% of average loans outstanding, comprised of net charge-offs of $31.3 million in the commercial portfolio and $14.9 million in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by net recoveries of $0.2 million in the residential mortgage portfolio. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $63.4 million, or 0.27% of average loans outstanding, comprised of net charge-offs of $52.8 million in the commercial portfolio (inclusive of the $29.7 million single borrower charge-off described above) and $11.8 million in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by net recoveries of $1.2 million in the residential mortgage portfolio.

We currently expect modest charge-offs and provision in 2025; however, loan growth, portfolio composition, asset quality metrics and future assumptions in economic forecasts will drive the level of credit loss reserves in future periods.

Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Balance Sheet Analysis—Allowance for Credit Losses” provides additional information on changes in the allowance for credit losses and general credit quality.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $364.1 million, a $75.6 million, or 26%, increase from 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, noninterest income included two supplemental disclosure items totaling $49.3 million, comprised of a $65.4 million loss on restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio and a $16.1 million gain on the sale of a parking facility. Excluding these supplemental disclosure items, noninterest income was up $26.4 million, or 8%, driven by increases in most fee categories. Noninterest income variances are discussed in more detail below.

Table 4 presents, for each of the three years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the components of noninterest income, along with the percentage changes between years. Table 5 presents supplemental disclosure items included in noninterest income (Table 4) by component for the same periods.

Service charges on deposit accounts include consumer, business, and corporate deposit account servicing fees, as well as nonsufficient funds fees on non-consumer accounts, overdraft and overdraft protection fees, and other customer transaction-related fees. Service charges on deposit accounts were $91.1 million, up $5.1 million, or 6%, from 2023. The increase from 2023 was largely attributable to a $4.4 million increase in service charges on business accounts, including commercial analysis fees, nonsufficient funds and overdraft fees, driven by deposit balance activity, strong sales activity, and higher instances of overdrafts. Consumer service charges increased $0.7 million compared to the prior year.

Trust fee income represents revenue generated from asset management services provided to individuals, businesses and institutions. Trust fees totaled $71.7 million in 2024, a $4.2 million, or 6%, increase from 2023, primarily attributable to an increase of $2.5 million in personal trust income, $1.4 million in institutional trust fees, and $0.4 million in corporate trust and retirement services fees.

Trust assets under management increased to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $9.7 billion at December 31, 2023.

Bank card and ATM fees include income from credit and debit card transactions, fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, and fees earned from ATM transactions. Bank card and ATM fees totaled $85.5 million in 2024, up $2.5 million, or 3%,

compared to 2023. The increase from 2023 is the result of increases of $1.7 million in merchant fees and $1.1 million in debit and credit card fees, as spending was strong in 2024, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in ATM fees.

Investment and annuity fees and insurance commissions, which include both fees earned from sales of annuity and insurance products as well as managed account fees, totaled $43.4 million in 2024, a $6.7 million, or 18%, increase from 2023. The increase is largely

52

Table of Contents

attributable to a $7.4 million increase in annuity fees and investment fees as sales activity increased amid the favorable interest rate environment, partially offset by a $0.7 million decline in corporate underwriting and insurance fees.

Income from secondary mortgage market operations is comprised of income produced from the origination and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We offer a full range of mortgage products to our customers and typically sell longer-term fixed rate loans, while retaining the majority of adjustable-rate loans and mortgage loans generated through programs to support customer relationships. Income from secondary mortgage market operations totaled $12.4 million in 2024, an increase of $3.2 million, or 35%, from 2023. Although there continued to be a dampened demand for mortgage loans and refinancing as a result of the elevated interest rate environment, the dollar amount of mortgage loan originations that were sold in the secondary market versus retained in our portfolio in 2024 was up 30%, driving higher income in this business line. Secondary mortgage market operations income will vary based on application volume and the percentage of loans closed and ultimately sold.

There were no gains or losses on sales of securities during the year ended December 31, 2024. There was a $65.4 million loss on sales of securities for the year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of the strategic restructuring of the available for sale portfolio to enhance net interest margin through deployment of the proceeds into higher-yielding earning assets and repayment of short-term borrowings.

Income from bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) is generated through insurance benefit proceeds as well as the growth of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held. BOLI income totaled $16.9 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 10%, from 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in income from changes in cash surrender value.

Credit-related fees include fees assessed on letters of credit and unused portions of loan commitments. Credit-related fees were $12.0 million for 2024, down $0.5 million, or 4% compared to 2023, attributable to decreases of $0.4 million in letter of credit fees and $0.1 million in unused commitment fees. Income from these products will vary based on letters of credit issued, credit line utilization and prevailing assessment rates.

Income or loss from derivatives, largely resulting from our customer interest rate derivative program, was a loss of $3.8 million in 2024, compared to income of $0.4 million in 2023. Derivative income or loss can be volatile and is dependent upon the composition of the portfolio, volume and mix of sales activity and market value adjustments due to market interest rate movement. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to a $3.8 million decrease in customer derivative income largely tied to the elevated interest rate environment, which affects demand for variable rate loans and related derivative products, valuation adjustments, and related collateral income/expense for the program as a whole.

The decline in derivative income also reflects a $1.4 million increase in losses associated with our Visa Class B derivative contract.

Net gains on sales of premises, equipment and other assets consists primarily of net revenue earned from sales of excess bank owned facilities and equipment no longer in use, gains on sales of Small Business Administration and other non-residential mortgage loans, and leases and other assets associated with the equipment finance line of business. Net gains on sales of premises, equipment and other assets totaled $7.8 million in 2024, compared to $19.4 million in 2023, down $11.6 million. The decrease was primarily related to previously mentioned gain on the sale of a stand-alone parking facility of $16.1 million in 2023 that was identified as a supplemental disclosure item. Excluding the supplemental disclosure item, net gains on sales of premises, equipment and other assets were up $4.6 million, and largely related to gains on sales of SBA loans and other premises sales.

Other miscellaneous income is comprised of various items, including dividends on FHLB stock, income from small business investment companies (SBICs), and syndication fees, among others. Other miscellaneous income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $27.0 million, up $3.4 million, or 14%, from 2023, largely due to a $2.2 million increase in dividends on FHLB stock as a result of both an increase in prevailing rates and an increase in volume of stock owned and a $1.0 million increase in income from SBICs.

We expect noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2025 to increase 3.5% to 4.5% from the 2024 level of $364.1 million. Our forecast has not yet been updated to include any impact from the pending Sabal Trust Company transaction.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $819.9 million, a $16.9 million, or 2%, decrease from 2023. Noninterest expense for both years includes supplemental disclosure items attributable to a special assessment by the FDIC in connection with the protection of uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception for two bank failures in 2023, totaling $26.1 million in 2023, with an additional adjustment to the assessment of $3.8 million in 2024. Excluding the supplemental disclosure items for both periods, noninterest expense totaled $816.1 million, up $5.4 million, or 1%, from 2023.

Noninterest expense variances are discussed in more detail below.

Personnel expense consists of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance. Personnel expense totaled $469.4 million in 2024, up $8.6 million or 2%, compared to 2023. The increase in personnel expense was largely driven by higher incentive-based compensation, bonus, merit-based increases in salaries, related payroll tax expense and health insurance benefit cost. These increases were partially offset by the impact of a decrease in headcount and a favorable impact from salary deferrals associated with lending activities.

Occupancy and equipment expenses are primarily composed of lease expenses, depreciation, maintenance and repairs, rent, taxes, and other equipment expenses. Total occupancy and equipment expenses of $71.1 million in 2024, increased $0.7 million, or 1%, from 2023. The increase was largely driven by the elimination of revenue from the parking facility sold in late 2023 and an increase in leased facility expense, partially offset by decreases in depreciation and maintenance on furniture, fixtures and equipment.

Data processing expense includes expenses related to third party technology processing and servicing costs, technology project costs and fees associated with bank card and ATM transactions. Data processing expense totaling $121.9 million in 2024 was up $4.2 million, or 4%, from 2023. The increase was largely attributable to higher costs associated with ongoing data processing arrangements of $3.7 million and net card, ATM and merchant fee expense of $1.4 million. These increases were partially

offset by a decrease in software amortization $1.1 million.

Professional services expense totaling $41.9 million in 2024 increased $3.6 million, or 9%, from 2023, primarily driven by expenses incurred for certain outsourcing initiatives that commenced in the current year.

Amortization of intangibles in 2024 totaled $9.4 million, a $2.1 million, or 19% decrease from 2023 as a result of the accelerated amortization methods used.

Table of Contents

Deposit insurance and regulatory fees totaled $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $25.8 million from 2023. Included in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are previously mentioned $3.8 million and $26.1 million, respectively, of expense attributable to a special assessment made by the FDIC. Excluding the special assessment charges in the respective periods,

deposit insurance and regulatory fees were down $3.4 million, or 14%, mostly reflective of changes in our risk-based assessment calculation.

The FDIC special assessment expense recorded to date is management’s estimate of our portion of the cost attributable to the systemic risk exception based on information from the FDIC. However, the loss estimates resulting from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank may be subject to further change pending the projected and actual outcome of loss share agreements, joint ventures, and outstanding litigation. The exact amount of losses incurred will not be determined until the FDIC terminates the receiverships of these banks; therefore, the exact exposure to the Company remains unknown.

Net gains on sales of other real estate and foreclosed assets exceeded expense by $2.5 million in 2024, compared to $0.6 million in 2023. Gains or losses on the sale of other real estate and foreclosed assets may occur periodically and are dependent on the number and type of assets for sale and current market conditions.

Corporate value, franchise taxes, and other non-income taxes totaled $19.0 million in 2024, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 7%, from 2023, largely attributable to a decrease in bank share tax, partially offset by an increase in franchise tax. The calculation of bank share tax is based on multiple variables, including average quarterly assets, earnings and stockholders’ equity to determine the taxable assessment value.

Business development-related expenses (including advertising, travel, entertainment and contributions), totaling $31.1 million in 2024, were up $1.5 million, or 5%, from 2023. The increase was largely driven by increases in marketing and business development expense, including certain costs associated bank sponsored functions, natural disaster response and relief, travel expense and customer incentives.

Other retirement expense includes costs associated with pension on other post-retirement plan expense. Noninterest expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was reduced by a net credit in other retirement expense totaling $18.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively. The higher net credit in 2024 was largely driven by changes in actuarial assumptions for the current plan year.

All other expenses totaled $52.5 million in 2024, up $0.3 million, or 1%, from 2023.

We expect noninterest expense to increase 4% to 5% for the year ended December 31, 2025 from the adjusted 2024 level of $816.1 million. Our forecast has not yet been updated to include any impact from the pending Sabal Trust Company transaction.

Income Taxes

We recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 19.7% in 2024, relatively consistent with 19.9% in 2023. Based on the current forecast, management expects the effective tax rate to be approximately 20% to 21% in 2025, absent any changes in tax law.

Our effective tax rate has historically varied from the federal statutory rate primarily due to tax-exempt income and tax credits. Interest income on bonds issued by or loans to state and municipal governments and authorities, and earnings from the bank-owned life insurance contract program are the major components of tax-exempt income.

Table 8 reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The main source of tax credits has been investments in tax-advantage securities and tax credit projects. These investments are made primarily in the markets we serve and directed at tax credits issued under the Federal and State New Market Tax Credit (NMTC), Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and pre-2018 Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZAB) and Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCB) programs. The investments generate tax credits which reduce current and future taxes and are recognized when earned as a benefit in the provision for income taxes. Additionally, the amortization of the LIHTC investment cost will be recognized as a component of income tax expense in proportion to the tax credits recognized over the 10-year credit period of each project.

We have invested in NMTC projects through investments in our own CDEs, as well as other unrelated CDEs. Federal tax credits from NMTC investments are recognized over a seven-year period, while recognition of the benefits from state tax credits varies from three to five years.

Based only on tax credit investments that have been made through 2024, we expect to realize benefits from federal and state tax credits over the next three years totaling $9.8 million, $8.2 million and $8.0 million for 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. We intend to continue making investments in tax credit projects. However, our ability to access new credits will depend upon, among other factors, federal and state tax policies and the level of competition for such credits.

At December 31, 2024, we had a net deferred tax asset of $146.6 million, which is comprised of $297.4 million in deferred tax assets (net of valuation allowance), offset by $150.8 million of deferred tax liabilities. Several factors are considered in determining the recoverability of the deferred tax asset components, such as the history of taxable earnings, reversal of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on our review of these factors, we have established a $2.6 million valuation allowance for state net operating losses and $2.0 million valuation allowance for deferred executive compensation.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Short-Term Investments

Short-term liquidity assets are held to ensure funds are available to meet the cash flow needs of both borrowers and depositors. At December 31, 2024, short-term liquidity investments, including interest-bearing bank deposits and federal funds sold, totaled $939.7 million, an increase of $312.6 million from December 31, 2023. Average short-term investments for 2024 totaled $547.8 million,

a $90.8 million decrease from $638.6 million in 2023. Typically, these balances will change on a daily basis depending upon movement in customer loan and deposit accounts. The comparative average balance for the year ended December 31, 2023 was impacted by excess liquidity held in response to the disruption in the financial industry caused by bank failures. See further discussion in the “Liquidity” section that follows.

Investment Securities

The purpose of the securities portfolio is to increase profitability, mitigate interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory pledging requirements. Our securities portfolio includes securities categorized as available for sale and held to maturity. Available for sale securities are carried at fair value and may be sold prior to maturity. Unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders' equity.

Our investment in securities totaled $7.6 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The investment securities portfolio is managed by ALCO to assist in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity while providing an acceptable rate of return. At December 31, 2024, the amortized cost of securities available for sale totaled $5.8 billion and securities held to maturity totaled $2.4 billion, compared to $5.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The year over year changes in each of the portfolios is largely reflective of maturities and paydowns from both portfolios reinvested in the available for sale portfolio.

Our securities portfolio consists mainly of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities that are issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. We invest only in high quality investment grade securities and manage the investment portfolio duration generally between two and five and a half years. At December 31, 2024, the average expected maturity of the portfolio was 5.58 years with an effective duration of 4.12 years and a nominal weighted-average yield of 2.66%. Under an immediate, parallel rate shock of 100 bps and 200 bps, the effective duration would be 4.11 years and 4.07 years, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the average expected maturity of the portfolio was 6.22 years with an effective duration of 4.60 years and a nominal weighted-average yield of 2.48%. The change in expected maturity, effective duration, and nominal weighted-average yield is primarily attributable to portfolio reinvestment activity in 2024.

We have in place fair value hedges on certain fixed-rate commercial mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $477.5 million in notional amount of forward-starting fixed payer swaps that convert the latter portion of the term of these available for sale securities to a floating rate. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk. This strategy provides a fixed-rate coupon during the front-end unhedged tenor of the bonds and results in a floating-rate security during the back-end hedged tenor.

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the securities portfolio for credit loss. Based on our assessments, expected credit loss was negligible for all reporting periods in 2024 and 2023, and therefore no allowance for credit loss was recorded.

There were no investments in securities of a single issuer, other than U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that exceeded 10% of stockholders’ equity. We do not invest in subprime or “Alt A” home mortgage-backed securities. Investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value, while held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Unrealized holding gains (losses) on available for sale securities are excluded from net income and are recognized, net of tax, in other comprehensive income and in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The following table presents the amortized cost of debt securities by type at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Loan Portfolio

Total loans at December 31, 2024 were $23.3 billion, compared to $23.9 billion at December 31, 2023, down $622.5 million, or 3%. The decrease is reflective of the strategic reduction of the shared national credit portfolio as we focus on originating more granular loans, down $307.6 million, and includes declines across all portfolios except for residential mortgage, discussed in more detail below.

Our commercial customer base is diversified over a range of industries. We lend mainly to middle-market and smaller commercial entities, although we do participate in larger shared-credit loan facilities generally with businesses/sponsors operating in our market areas that are well known to the relationship officers. The funded balance of our shared national credits portfolio at December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $2.3 billion, or 10% of total loans, compared to $2.6 billion, or 11% of total loans at December 31, 2023. Our shared national credit industry concentration at December 31, 2024 includes approximately $339.7 million in both health care-related facilities and finance and insurance, $336.3 million in manufacturing, and $306.4 million in real estate, rental and leasing, with the remaining to various other industries.

The commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loan portfolio includes both commercial non-real estate and commercial real estate – owner occupied loans. C&I loans totaled $12.9 billion, or 55% of the total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $162.5 million from December 31, 2023. The year over year decline in this portfolio is reflective of a $286.2 million reduction of shared national credits within this portfolio.

Our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. Nevertheless, we may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to different borrowers or groups of borrowers, specific types of collateral and industries.

The following table provides detail of the more significant industry concentrations for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, which is based on NAICS codes for all industries, with the exception of energy, which is based on the borrower’s source of revenue (i.e. manufacturer whose income is derived from energy-related business is reported as energy).

Construction and land development loans totaled approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $270.0 million, or 17%, from December 31, 2023. The decrease reflects loans converting to permanent financing outpacing the funding of new and existing loans. The declines in both the commercial real estate - income producing and construction loan portfolios is reflective of an increase in payoffs and our efforts to limit our growth in income-producing real estate with a focus on resilient projects given the current economic environment.

Residential mortgages totaled $4.0 billion at December 31, 2024, up $75.3 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023. The growth in mortgage loans includes a combination of completed construction loans converting to permanent financing, as well as new loan growth. Consumer loans totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024, down $76.9 million, or 5%, compared to December 31, 2023. The decline is reflective of both slowing demand and the impact of our exit from the indirect automobile lending market, where the existing portfolio is in run-off.

Nonaccrual loans plus ORE and foreclosed assets totaled $125.1 million at December 31, 2024, up $62.5 million compared to December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans totaled $97.3 million, an increase of $38.3 million compared to December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of the loan portfolio increased to 0.42% in 2024, compared to 0.25% in 2023, which we believe represents a return to a more typical level following the recent benign credit environment. ORE and foreclosed assets were $27.8 million at December 31, 2024, up $24.2 million from December 31, 2023, largely attributable to foreclosed property from one commercial borrower.

Reportable modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties totaled $99.5 million in 2024 and includes $20.2 million of nonaccrual loans. Modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties totaled $24.5 million in 2023 and included $0.1

Table of Contents

million of nonaccrual loans. These reportable modifications are granted as a part of our loss mitigation strategy to maximize expected payments. The increase in reportable modified loans reflects the continued stress on certain borrowers resulting from prolonged elevated interest rates, inflation, insurance costs, and other market conditions.

Criticized commercial loans totaled $623.0 million at December 31, 2024, up from $273.7 million at December 31, 2023. Criticized loans are defined as those having potential or well-defined weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention (risk-rated special mention, substandard and doubtful), including both accruing and nonaccruing loans. Criticized commercial loans comprised 3.47% of that portfolio at December 31, 2024, up from 1.47% at December 31, 2023. Management believes the migration in the level of criticized loans to be mostly indicative of continued normalization compared to the recent benign credit environment, including certain downgrades resulting from the most recent regulatory examination of loans within our shared national credit portfolio. We remain focused on identifying specific and broader risk indicators that may be impacting certain segments in our portfolio, and we have not seen signs of significant weakening in any particular industry, sector or geographic segment beyond what we believe has been experienced by the banking industry as a whole. Our criticized commercial loans at December 31, 2024 are spread across many industries, with the largest concentrations as follows: $95.7 million in manufacturing, $90.9 million in retail trade, $68.8 million in wholesale trade, $68.7 million in hospitality, $62.7 million in transportation and warehousing, $56.7 million in construction, $49.4 million real estate, rental and leasing, $44.6 million healthcare and social assistance, and $27.4 million in professional, scientific and technical services. Commercial loans risk rated pass-watch totaled $521.4 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $433.6 million at December 31, 2023. The pass-watch risk rating includes credits with negative performance trends that reflect sufficient risk to cause concern, but have not risen to the level of criticized.

Allowance for Credit Losses

At December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $342.9 million, comprised of $318.9 million in allowance for loan losses and $24.1 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The allowance for credit losses increased $6.1 million from $336.8 million at December 31, 2023, which was comprised of $307.9 million in allowance for loan losses and $28.9 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The $11.0 million increase in the funded allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 reflects higher coverage across most portfolios, resulting from stress related to prolonged elevated interest rates and inflation and other market conditions. The decline in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $4.8 million was largely volume driven as unfunded commitments are down.

Our allowance for credit losses coverage to total loans increased to 1.47% at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.41% at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on the commercial portfolio totaled $272.5 million, or 1.52% of that portfolio, at December 31, 2024, up from $270.7 million, or 1.46%, at December 31, 2023.

The allowance for credit losses on the residential mortgage portfolio totaled $42.4 million, or 1.07% of that portfolio, at December 31, 2024, up from $39.0 million, or 1.00%, at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on the consumer portfolio totaled $28.0 million, or 2.04% of that portfolio, at December 31, 2024, up from $27.1 million, or 1.87%, at December 31, 2023. We believe the increased coverage to total loans is prudent given the uncertainty in economic conditions.

The $6.1 million net increase in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2023 includes an increase of $7.9 million in individually evaluated reserves (generally used for nonperforming loans), partially offset by a decline of $1.8 million in collectively evaluated reserves. We utilized the December 2024 Moody’s economic scenarios to inform our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024. After considering the variables underlying each of the Moody’s economic scenarios, management probability-weighed the baseline scenario at 40% and the downside S-2 mild recessionary scenario at 60% in the computation of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024, consistent with the weighting used at December 31, 2023. Each of the scenarios considered have varying degrees of severity and duration of inflationary pressure, including volatility in commodities prices and impacts to the labor market, the consequences of the Federal Reserve’s actions with regard to monetary policy, the effect of the recent change in presidential administration on fiscal and other policies, and impacts from geopolitical unrest. Refer to the Economic Outlook section of this discussion and analysis for further information on the Moody’s scenarios and our weighting assumptions.

We currently expect modest charge-offs and provision for credit losses in 2025; however, loan growth, portfolio composition, asset quality metrics and future assumptions in economic forecasts will drive the level of credit loss reserves in future periods.

Deposits

Deposits provide the most significant source of funding for our interest earning assets. Generally, our ability to compete for market share depends on our deposit pricing and our wide range of products and services that are focused on customer needs, among other factors. We offer high-quality banking services with convenient delivery channels, including online and mobile banking. We provide specialized services to our commercial customers to promote commercial deposit growth. These services include treasury management, industry expertise and lockbox services.

Lack of diversity in concentration within a deposit base may increase the risk of events or trends that could prompt a larger-scale demand for deposits outflow. Concerns over a financial institution’s ability to protect deposit balances in excess of the federally insured limit may increase the risk of a deposit run. We consider our deposit base to be seasoned, stable and well-diversified. We also offer our customers an insured cash sweep product (ICS) that allows customers to secure deposits above FDIC insured limits. We continue to see demand for the ICS product, with the balance totaling $359.7 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $303.8 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, we have calculated our average deposit account size by dividing period-end deposits by the population of accounts with balances to be approximately $37,900, which includes $199,500 in our commercial and small business lines (excluding public funds), $122,500 in our wealth management business line, and $18,600 in our consumer business line.

Further, at December 31, 2024, our sources of liquidity exceed uninsured deposits. We have estimated the Bank’s amount of uninsured deposits using the methodologies and assumptions required for FDIC regulatory reporting to be approximately $14.6 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $13.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Our uninsured deposit total at December 31, 2024 includes approximately $3.6 billion of public funds that have pledged securities as collateral, leaving approximately $11.0 billion of noncollateralized, uninsured deposits compared to total liquidity of $19.5 billion. Our ratio of noncollateralized, uninsured deposits to total deposits was approximately 37.3% at December 31, 2024, compared to 34.4% at December 31, 2023.

Total deposits were $29.5 billion at December 31, 2024, down $197.2 million or 1%, from December 31, 2023. Deposit levels and composition in 2024 were influenced by the decline in brokered deposits and the elevated interest rate environment fostering a continued shift toward and growth in interest-bearing products. Average deposits of $29.2 billion for 2024 were down $309.6 million, or 1%, from 2023.

Noninterest-bearing deposit levels continued to trend downward as customers shift to interest-bearing products amid the elevated interest rate environment and as consumer and business spending remains strong. The current level of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits of 36% represents what we consider to be a more typical, pre-pandemic mix of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits.

Interest-bearing transaction and savings accounts of $11.3 billion at December 31, 2024 increased $647.0 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2023. Retail time deposits totaled $4.3 billion at December 31, 2024, up $102.2 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023, with 6% of the increase in time deposits greater than $250,000. The year over year growth in these products is largely reflective of attractive rate offerings in the elevated interest rate environment.

Interest-bearing public fund deposits totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2024, up $69.5 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023. Year-end public fund account balances are subject to annual fluctuations dependent upon a number of factors, including the timing of tax collections. Seasonal cash inflows from public entities in the fourth quarter of each year typically results in higher balances than at other times during the year with subsequent reductions in the first quarter of the following year.  Brokered deposits totaled $6.9 million at December 31, 2024, down $582.9 million

from December 31, 2023 as a result of the maturity of brokered deposits that were not replaced.

Table 21 sets forth average balances and weighted-average rates paid on deposits for each year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, as well as the percentage of total deposits for each category. Table 22 sets forth the maturities of time certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 at December 31, 2024.

As noted above, we have estimated the Bank’s amount of uninsured deposits at December 31, 2024 to be approximately $14.6 billion, using the methodologies and assumptions required for FDIC regulatory reporting.

Management expects full year 2025 end of period growth in deposits to be in the low single digit range from $29.5 billion at December 31, 2024.

Short-Term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings totaled $639.0 million at December 31, 2024, down $515.8 million, or 45% from December 31, 2023. Average short-term borrowings for 2024 totaled $672.3 million, down $802.0 million, or 47%, compared to 2023. The declines from December 31, 2023 reflects the net repayment of $700 million of FHLB borrowings. Short-term borrowings are a core portion of the Company’s funding strategy, the balance of which can fluctuate depending on our funding needs and the sources utilized.

Table 23 sets forth balances of short-term borrowings for each of the past three years. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the FHLB. Customer repurchase agreements are a source of customer funding. These agreements are offered mainly to commercial customers to assist them with their ongoing cash management strategies or to provide a temporary investment vehicle for their excess liquidity pending redeployment for corporate or investment purposes. While customer repurchase agreements provide a recurring source of funds to the Bank, the amounts available over time will vary.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt totaled $210.5 million at December 31, 2024, down $25.8 million from December 31, 2023, largely due to activity associated with tax credit fund activity.

67

Table of Contents

Long-term debt at December 31, 2024 includes subordinated notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million, a fixed rate of 6.25% per annum and a stated maturity of June 15, 2060. Subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve, the Company may redeem the notes in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after June 15, 2025. This debt qualifies as tier 2 capital in the calculation of certain regulatory capital ratios.

LOAN COMMITMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into financial instruments, such as commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of its customers. Such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded, although they expose the Bank to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans.

Commitments to extend credit totaled $9.2 billion at December 31, 2024

and include revolving commercial credit lines, non-revolving loan commitments issued mainly to finance the acquisition and development of construction of real property or equipment, and credit card and personal credit lines. The availability of funds under commercial credit lines and loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract, which may include the maintenance of sufficient collateral coverage levels, payment and financial performance, and compliance with other contractual conditions. Loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to adjustment or cancellation if the borrower’s credit quality deteriorates. A number of commercial and personal credit lines are used only partially or, in some cases, not at all before they expire, and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.

Letters of credit totaled $420.6 million at December 31, 2024. A substantial majority of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the Bank to fulfill a customer’s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform. The Bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to customers’ other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors of essential goods and services.

The contract amounts of these instruments reflect our exposure to credit risk. The Bank undertakes the same credit evaluation in making loan commitments and assuming conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support. At December 31, 2024, the Company had a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $24.1 million.

The following table shows the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31, 2024 and 2023 according to expiration date.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

We proactively manage risks to capture opportunities and maximize shareholder value. We balance revenue generation and profitability with the inherent risks of our business activities. Enterprise risk management helps protect shareholder value by assessing, monitoring, and managing the risks associated with our businesses. Strong risk management practices enhance decision-making, facilitate successful implementation of new initiatives, and where appropriate, support undertaking greater levels of well-managed risk to drive growth and achieve strategic objectives. Our risk management culture integrates a board-approved risk appetite with senior management direction and governance to facilitate the execution of the Company’s strategic plan. This integration ensures the daily management of risks by product types and continuous corporate monitoring of the levels of risk across the Company. We make changes to our enterprise risk management program and risk governance framework as described here at the direction of senior management and the Board of Directors to capture opportunities and to respond to changes in strategic, business, and operational environments.

Risk Categories and Definitions

Consistent with other participants in the financial services industry, the primary risk exposures of the Company are credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, reputational, and strategic. We have adopted these seven risk categories as outlined by the Federal Reserve Board and other bank regulators to govern the risk management of banks and bank holding companies. Oversight responsibility for these categories is assigned within our risk committee governance structure:

•
Credit risk arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation. 

•
Market risk is a financial institution’s condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or equity prices. 

•
Liquidity risk is the potential that an institution will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as “funding liquidity risk”) or that it cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions ("market liquidity risk").

•
Operational risk is the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, breaches in customer data, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. Consistently and interchangeably for the Company, Basel II defines this risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The Company assesses compliance risk, the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards, as a subcategory of operational risk. 

•
Legal risk is the potential that unenforceable contracts, lawsuits, or adverse judgments can disrupt or otherwise negatively affect the operations or condition of a banking organization. 

•
Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions. The Company also recognizes its reputation with shareholders and associates is an important factor of reputational risk. 

•
Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the competitive landscape of banking and financial services industries and operating environment.

Risk Committee Governance Structure

Effective risk management governance requires active oversight, participation, and interaction by senior management and the Board of Directors. Our enterprise risk management framework uses a tiered risk/reward committee structure to facilitate the timely discussion of significant risks, issues and risk mitigation strategies to inform management and the Board’s decision making. Additionally, the committee structure provides ongoing oversight and facilitates escalation within assigned risk committees. Following is a summary of our risk governance structure and related responsibilities:

•
Board risk committees. The Company’s Board of Directors has established a Board Risk Committee and Credit Risk Management Subcommittee of the Board Risk Committee to oversee the effective establishment of a risk governance framework, provide for an independent Credit Review assurance function, ensure the overall corporate risk profile is within its risk appetite, and direct changes or make recommendations to the Board of Directors when determined necessary. Additionally, the Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee to provide independent oversight on the effectiveness of these matters and the Company’s internal control and regulatory environment. The Board Risk 

69

Table of Contents

Committee is chaired by an independent director. The Board has designated Ms. Joan Teofilo and Mr. H. Merritt Lane, III, independent directors who serve on the Board Risk Committee, as risk management experts. Other committees of the Board of Directors oversee certain risks that overlap with the Board Risk Committee’s enterprise risk management oversight, including the Compensation Committee, which evaluates and manages any risk posed by compensation and benefits programs and oversees inclusion and belonging efforts, and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which provides oversight on a broad range of issues surrounding the composition and operation of the Board of Directors.

•
Governance committees. The Capital Committee (CAPCO) of the Company serves as the senior level management risk/reward committee and oversees the business strategy, organizational structure, capital planning, and liquidity strategies for the Company. CAPCO directly oversees the strategic and reputation risk categories, which include litigation strategy and the development of capital stress testing within the Company’s risk governance framework. CAPCO drives business strategy development and execution, provides corporate financial oversight, and is responsible for portfolio risk committee oversight. CAPCO provides oversight of the portfolio risk/reward committees to ensure tactics to address business strategy changes are properly vetted and adopted, and protect the Company’s reputation. 

•
Portfolio committees. The Company has three portfolio risk/reward committees focusing on credit (CREDCO), market and liquidity through asset/liability management (ALCO), and operational, legal and compliance (OPCO) risk categories. These committees review and monitor the risk categories in a portfolio context ensuring risk assessment and management processes are being effectively executed to identify and manage risk and direct changes and escalate issues to CAPCO and Board Risk Committees when needed. The committees also monitor the risk portfolios for changes to the Company’s risk profile as well as ensure the risk portfolio is performing within the board-approved risk appetite. Portfolio committees report to CAPCO. In addition, the Company has established a Sustainability Committee, which is a management committee that develops, monitors and assesses the strategies related to the environment, social responsibility and sustainable growth. 

Risk Leadership and Organization

The risk management function of the Company is led by our Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the CEO, provides overall vision, direction and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management program. The Chief Risk Officer exercises independent judgment and reporting of risk through a direct working relationship with the Board Risk Committee, and the Chief Credit Officer has the same role with the Credit Risk Management Subcommittee. The functional areas reporting to the Chief Risk Officer are the enterprise risk management, operational risk management, model risk management, information technology risk management, data governance, compliance, credit review (administrative only), corporate insurance, regulatory relations, and financial crimes programs. The Chief Risk Officer also works closely with the Chief Internal Auditor to provide assurance to the Board and senior management regarding risk management controls and their effectiveness. The Chief Internal Auditor reports to the Board’s Audit Committee to assure independence of the internal audit function. Another risk management function reporting to the CEO is the Chief Credit Officer.

Credit Risk

The Bank’s primary lending focus is to provide commercial, consumer, and real estate loans to consumers, to small and middle market businesses, to larger corporate clients in their respective market areas, and to state, county, parish and municipal government entities. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means to reduce the risks associated with economic fluctuations. The Bank has no significant concentrations of loans to individual borrowers or foreign entities.

Our commercial and industrial portfolio, which includes commercial non-real estate and owner occupied commercial real estate lending is diverse across various industries. We continuously manage our exposure to improve our cross-industry diversification, and proactively manage potential impacts to earnings.

Real estate loan levels are monitored throughout the year and the bank currently does not have a commercial real estate concentration as defined by interagency guidelines.

Monitoring collateral is also an essential component of managing the Bank’s real estate-and non-real estate related credit risk exposure. For real estate-secured loans, third-party valuations are obtained at the time of origination, and updated if it is determined that the collateral value has deteriorated or if the loan is deemed to be a problem loan. Property valuations are ordered through, and reviewed by, the Bank’s appraisal department, which is independent of the loan origination and approval process. When deemed necessary, third-party valuations may also be obtained for non-real estate collateral based on the same criteria as real estate secured loans. Collateral valuations, along with anticipated selling costs, are used to assess the need for an appropriate allowance allocation and/or full or partial charge-off when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due.

70

Table of Contents

The Bank maintains a Credit Review function, that is managed by our Director of Credit Review who reports to the Credit Risk Management Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Board Risk Committee, so that developing credit concerns are identified and addressed in a timely manner. Further, an active watch list review process is in place as part of the Bank’s problem loan management strategy, and a list of loans 90 days past due and still accruing is reviewed with management (including the Chief Credit Officer) at least monthly. Recommendations flow from all of the above activities with the goal of recognizing nonperforming loans and determining the appropriate accrual status.

Asset/Liability Management

Asset/Liability Management consists of quantifying, analyzing, and controlling interest rate risk (IRR) to maintain stability in net interest income under varying interest rate environments. The principal objective of asset/liability management is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable interest rate risk limits and maintaining adequate levels of liquidity. Our net earnings are materially dependent on our net interest income.

IRR inherent in the Company’s balance sheet consists of reprice, option, yield curve, and basis risks. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from “embedded options” present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options, deposit early withdrawal options, and interest rate options. These options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change, which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the Company. Yield curve risk refers to the risk resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices, which subsequently results in changes to the profit spread on an earning asset or liability. Basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities, such as savings accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates.

ALCO manages our IRR exposures through proactive measurement, monitoring, and management actions. ALCO is responsible for maintaining levels of IRR within limits approved by the Board of Directors by adhering to a risk management policy that is designed to promote a stable net interest margin in periods of interest rate fluctuation. Accordingly, the Company’s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by ALCO, which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures, limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. A variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk, the distribution of risk, the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships.

The Company utilizes an asset/liability model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of IRR associated with changing market rates. The model is used to perform net interest income, economic value of equity (EVE), stochastic, and gap analyses. When performing net interest income at risk analysis, the model is used to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and projected net income over the next 12-month and 24-month periods. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario given hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next 24 months. Regarding EVE analysis, the model is used to assess the change in theoretical equity market value that would occur in response to instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in market interest rates. EVE analysis is primarily used to identify long-term structural mismatches in the balance sheet as market rates move, while net interest income analysis assesses the impact of market rate movements over a short time horizon. Net interest income simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix as well as the pricing, repricing, and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. The impact of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, caps and floors, is also included in the model. Other interest rate-related risks such as prepayment, basis, and option risk are also considered.

Net Interest Income at Risk

Our primary market risk is interest rate risk that stems from uncertainty with respect to the absolute and relative levels of future market interest rates that affect our financial products and services. In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, management measures the sensitivity of our net interest income and cash flows under various market interest rate scenarios, establishes interest rate risk management policies and implements asset/liability management strategies designed to promote a relatively stable net interest margin under varying rate environments.

The following table presents an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in net interest income resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in rates at December 31, 2024. Shifts are measured in 100 basis point increments in a range from -500 to +500 basis points from base case, with -300 through +300 basis points presented in Table 25. Our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions including loan and deposit repricing characteristics, the rate of loan prepayments and other factors. The base scenario assumes that balance sheet composition and the current interest rate environment is held constant over a 24-month forecast period and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in

71

Table of Contents

net interest income. Policy limits on the change in net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios are approved by the Board of Directors. All policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant, although other scenarios are modeled.

The results indicate a general asset sensitivity across most scenarios driven primarily by repricing of cash flows in the investment and loan portfolios. As short-term rates have remained elevated, the funding mix has shifted to more rate sensitive deposits and wholesale sources resulting in lower overall net interest income at risk as deposit repricing is expected to offset rate adjustments in the floating rate loan book. Furthermore, due to the funding mix shift, the Bank is currently less sensitive to changes in short-term rate movements with interest rate risk being driven more by changes in the mid to long-term segment of the yield curve. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk with on-or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.

Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as anticipated. Additionally, a change in the U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to net interest income than indicated above. Strategic management of our balance sheet and earnings is fluid and would be adjusted to accommodate these movements. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets such as adjustable-rate loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Also, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. All of these factors are considered in monitoring exposure to interest rate risk.

Economic Value of Equity (EVE)

EVE simulation involves calculating the present value of all future cash flows from assets and subtracting the present value of all future cash outflows from liabilities including the impact of off-balance sheet items such as interest rate hedges. This analysis results in a theoretical market value of the bank’s equity or EVE. Management’s focus on EVE analysis is not on the resulting calculation of EVE itself, but instead on the sensitivity of EVE to changes in market rates. Policy limits on the change in EVE under a variety of interest rate scenarios are approved by the Board of Directors. The following table presents an analysis of the change in the Bank’s EVE resulting from instantaneous and parallel shifts in rates as of December 31, 2024. Shifts are measured in 100 basis point increments ranging from -500 to +500 basis points from base case, with -300 through +300 basis points presented in Table 26.

Table of Contents

The net changes in EVE presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the Board of Directors. Because EVE measures the present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not consider factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, possible hedging activities, or changing product spreads, each of which could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal controls and processes, people and systems, or from external events, including fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. We depend on the ability of our employees and systems to process, record and monitor a large number of transactions on an on-going basis. As operational risk remains elevated and as customer and regulatory expectations regarding information security have increased, the Company continues to enhance its controls, processes and systems in order to protect the Company’s networks, computers, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.

The Board Risk Committee has primary responsibility for the oversight of operational risk. In this capacity, the Board Risk Committee oversees the Company’s processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing cybersecurity risk. In addition, individual business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities.

See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the risks associated with an interruption or breach in our information systems or infrastructure and Item 1C. “Cybersecurity” for additional disclosures on cybersecurity and related risk management strategy and governance.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

Liquidity management ensures that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, while also meeting the operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs of the Company, the Bank and other subsidiaries. As part of the overall asset and liability management process, liquidity management strategies and measurements have been developed to manage and monitor liquidity risk. The following table summarizes available liquidity at December 31, 2024.

Liquidity levels of financial institutions have received heightened attention since the failure of several major regional U.S. banks that experienced large-scale deposit runs in the first half of 2023. Dampened depositor confidence over a financial institution’s ability to protect deposit balances in excess of the federally insured limit is thought to pose a higher likelihood of a deposit run, and, in turn, the risk that the institution may have insufficient liquidity to meet the customer demand. At December 31, 2024, our available on and off-balance sheet liquidity of $19.5 billion is well in excess of our estimated uninsured, noncollateralized deposits of approximately $11.0

billion.

The asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments, maturities and repayments of investment securities and occasional sales of various assets. Short-term investments such as federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank or with other commercial banks are additional sources of liquidity to meet cash flow requirements. Free securities represent unpledged securities that can be sold or used as collateral for borrowings, and include unpledged securities assigned to short-term dealer repurchase agreements or to the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. Management has established an internal target for the ratio of free securities to total securities of 20% or greater. As shown in Table 28 above, our ratios of free securities to total securities were 48.65% and 38.80% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Securities and FHLB letters of credit are pledged as collateral related to public funds and repurchase agreements. The carry value of total pledged securities was $3.9 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $829 million from December 31, 2023, driven largely by an increase in pledged FHLB letters of credits of $699 million, resulting a higher level of free securities.

The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity mainly through the ability to use cash sourced from various customers’ interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts. At December 31, 2024, deposits totaled $29.5 billion, a decrease of $197 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023. The decrease is reflective of the maturity of $583 million of brokered deposits that were not replaced, partially offset by organic growth.

Core deposits represent total deposits excluding certificates of deposits (CDs) of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits. Core deposits totaled $27.8 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $293 million from December 31, 2023. The ratio of core deposits to total deposits was 94.12% at December 31, 2024 up from 92.51% at December 31, 2023. The largest driver in the increase in the ratio was the decline in brokered deposits.

Brokered deposits totaled $6.9 million as of December 31, 2024, down from $583 million at December 31, 2023 as the result of the maturity of brokered certificates of deposit that were not replaced. The use of brokered deposits as a funding source is subject to certain policies regarding the amount, term and interest rate.

Purchases of federal funds, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings from customers provide additional sources of liquidity to meet short-term funding requirements. Besides funding from customer sources, the Bank has a line of credit with the FHLB that is secured by blanket pledges of certain mortgage loans. At December 31, 2024, the Bank had not borrowed from the FHLB and had approximately $5.5 billion remaining available under this line. The Bank also has unused borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve’s discount window of approximately $3.2 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, or at any point during the years then ended.

Wholesale funds, which are comprised of short-term borrowings, long-term debt and brokered deposits were 3.09% of core deposits at December 31, 2024 and 7.21% at December 31, 2023. Wholesale funds totaled $856 million

at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of $700 million of FHLB borrowings and the maturity of $582 million of brokered time deposits, partially offset by a $184 million increase in customer securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The Company has established an internal target for wholesale funds to be less than 25% of core deposits.

Other key measures used to monitor liquidity include the liquid asset ratio and the loan to deposit ratio. The liquid asset ratio (liquid assets, consisting of cash, short-term investments and free securities, divided by total liabilities) measures our ability to meet short-term obligations. Our liquid asset ratio was 15.26% at December 31, 2024 compared to 12.69% at December 31, 2023. Management has established a minimum liquid asset ratio of 7.5% and an internal target of 12% or greater. The loan to deposit ratio (average loans outstanding during the reporting period divided by average deposits outstanding) measures the amount of funds the Company lends for each dollar of deposits on hand. Our average loan-to-deposit ratio was 81.01% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 80.04% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management has established a target range for the loan to deposit ratio of 87% to 89%, but has and will continue to operate outside that range under certain market conditions and circumstances.

Cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Part II, Item 8 of this document present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Dividends received from the Bank have been the primary source of funds available to the Parent Company for the payment of dividends to our stockholders and for servicing its debt. The liquidity management process takes into account the various regulatory provisions that can limit the amount of dividends that the Bank can distribute to the Parent Company, as described in Note 12 – Stockholder’s Equity to the consolidated financial statements. The Parent targets cash and other liquid assets to provide liquidity in an amount sufficient to fund approximately six quarters of ongoing cash or liquid asset needs, consisting primarily of common stockholder dividends, debt service requirements, and any expected share repurchase or early extinguishment of debt. The Parent may operate below the target level on a temporary basis if a return to the target can be achieved in the near-term, generally not to exceed four quarters. The Parent had cash totaling $272.7 million at December 31, 2024.

Material Cash Requirements

The Company has sufficient access to liquidity for operations. The following table summarizes select significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024, according to payments due by period. The table excludes obligations under deposit contracts and short-term borrowings discussed previously in this analysis. The maturities of time deposits in amounts greater than $250,000 are presented in Table 22. Purchase obligations represent material legal and binding contracts to purchase services and goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts.

Capital Resources

The Company has a strong capital position which is vital to continued profitability, promotes depositor and investor confidence, and provides a solid foundation for economic downturns, future growth and flexibility in addressing strategic opportunities. Stockholders’ equity totaled $4.1 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The $324.0 million increase from December 31, 2023 is attributable to net income of $460.8 million, $15.0 million of other comprehensive income and $17.9 million of long-term incentive and dividend reinvestment activity, partially offset by dividends of $131.9 million and share repurchases of $37.8 million.

At December 31, 2024, our tangible common equity ratio was 9.47%, compared to 8.37% at December 31, 2023. The 110 bp increase from December 31, 2023 is comprised of net income (+136 bps), tangible asset contraction (+13 bps), stock-based compensation and other activity (+6 bps), and other comprehensive income (+4 bps), partially offset by dividends (-38 bps) and share repurchases (-11 bps).

The primary quantitative measures that regulators use to gauge capital adequacy are the ratios of Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (risk-based capital ratios) and the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets (Leverage ratio). The Federal Reserve Board’s final rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework and related changes per the Dodd-Frank Act established the Basel III minimum regulatory capital requirements for all organizations for Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios equal to 8.00%, 6.00%, and 4.5%, respectively, as well as set a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a Leverage ratio of 4.0%. Based on capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 using Basel III definitions, the Company and the Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the rule. The Company and the Bank have established internal target ranges for Total, Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios and the leverage ratio. At December 31, 2024, each of these capital ratios fell within, or above, their respective target range.

At December 31, 2024, our regulatory capital ratios were well in excess of current regulatory minimum requirements, including the conservatism buffers, by at least $1.2 billion. Additionally, both the Company and the Bank were considered “well capitalized” by regulatory agencies. Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.

The following table shows certain of the Company’s capital ratios and our regulatory capital ratios as calculated under current rules at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

We regularly perform stress analysis on our capital levels. One such scenario includes the hypothetical impact of including accumulated other comprehensive losses on market valuations of available for sale securities and cash flow hedges in regulatory capital and a further stress scenario that includes both those losses plus losses on the held to maturity investment portfolio in regulatory capital. We estimate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain in excess of the well-capitalized minimums under both of these stress scenarios at December 31, 2024.

In April 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a 33% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.40 per share. The Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2024 and $0.40 per share for the remaining three quarters of 2024, for an annual cash dividend rate of $1.50 per share. During 2023, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share, for an annual cash dividend rate of $1.20 per share. Subsequent to year end, on January 30, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, or 12.5%. The increases in our dividends are reflective of our strong regulatory ratios, allowing for improved shareholder returns. The Company has paid uninterrupted quarterly dividends to shareholders since 1967.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In January 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, purchase up to approximately 4.3 million shares of its outstanding common stock (approximately 5% of the shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022). The program allowed the Company to repurchase shares in the open market, by block purchase, through accelerated share repurchase plans, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in one or more transactions, from time to time, depending upon market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The program did not obligate the Company to purchase any shares and could have been terminated or amended by the Board at any time prior to the expiration date. Prior to the expiration on December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 762,993 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $49.40 per share, inclusive of commissions, under this program during 2024. The Company has accrued $0.1 million of estimated excise tax associated with share repurchases during 2024. No shares were repurchased under this program in 2023.

In December 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, effective January 1, 2025, pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, purchase up to approximately 4.3 million shares of its outstanding common stock (approximately 5% of the shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024). Like the prior program, the shares may be repurchased in the open market, by block purchase, through accelerated share repurchase plans, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in one or more transactions, from time to time, depending upon market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The program has an expiration date of December 31, 2026 and does not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. The program may be terminated or amended by the Board at any time prior to the expiration date. This program allows us to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when the market is advantageous.

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $122.1 million, or $1.40 per diluted common share (EPS), compared to $115.6 million, or $1.33 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2024 and $50.6 million, or $0.58 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a net charge of $75.4 million, or $0.68 per diluted share after-tax, of supplemental disclosure items. Excluding the impact of these supplemental disclosure items, EPS would have been $1.26 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no supplemental disclosure items in the third or fourth quarters of 2024.

Highlights of our fourth quarter of 2024 results (compared to third quarter of 2024):

•
Net income of $122.1 million, up $6.5 million

•
Pre-provision net revenue (a non-GAAP measure) of $165.2 million, compared to $166.5 million in the prior quarter

•
Loans declined $156.1 million, or 1%

•
Criticized commercial loans and nonaccrual loans continued to normalize, annualized net charge-off percentage improved to 0.20%, compared to 0.30% 

•
Allowance for credit losses coverage remained strong at 1.47%, up 1 bp

•
Deposits increased $509.9 million, or 2%

•
Net interest margin 3.41%, up 2 bp

•
Common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.14%, up 36 bps; tangible common equity ratio of 9.47%, down 9 bps

•
Efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP measure) of 54.46%, up 4 bps

Total loans at December 31, 2024 were $23.3 billion, a decrease of $156.1 million, or 1%, from September 30, 2024. The linked-quarter decline reflects increased payoffs of commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a seasonal increase in line utilization and higher activity in commercial non-real estate loans.

Total deposits at December 31, 2024 were $29.5 billion, up $509.9 million, or 2%, from September 30, 2024. The increase is largely the result of seasonal inflows in interest-bearing public funds, an increase in interest-bearing transaction and savings due to seasonality, competitive products and pricing, and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in retail time deposits driven by maturity concentration repricing at lower rates and promotional rate reductions during the fourth quarter, and a decrease in brokered deposits that matured and were not replaced.

Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $10.6 billion at December 31, 2024, up $98.0 million, or 1%, from September 30, 2024 and comprised 36% of total deposits at December 31, 2024. Interest-bearing transaction and savings deposits totaled $11.3 billion at December 31, 2024, up $413.1 million, or 4%, compared to September 30, 2024. Interest-bearing public fund deposits increased $508.4 million, or 19%, to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase in public funds is seasonal and largely attributable to year-end tax collections by local municipalities. Typically, these balances begin to runoff in the first quarter of each year. Retail time deposits of $4.4 billion decreased $326.0 million, or 7%, from September 30, 2024, largely attributable to maturities with lower repricing rate offerings. Brokered deposits were $6.9 million at December 31, 2024, down $183.6 million due to maturities which were not replaced.

Net interest income (te) for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $276.3 million, up $1.8 million, or 1%, from the third quarter of 2024. The net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 3.41%, up 2 bps from the third quarter of 2024, as lower deposit costs (+16 bps) and a favorable borrowing mix (+5 bps), and higher securities yields (+1 bp) was partially offset by lower loan yields (-20 bps).

The provision for credit losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $11.9 million, compared to $18.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. Net charge-offs were $11.7 million, or 0.20% of average total loans on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2024, down from $18.0 million, or 0.30% of average total loans, in the third quarter of 2024. Our allowance for credit losses was $342.9 million at December 31, 2024, up $0.2 million from September 30, 2024. Criticized commercial loans were $623.0 million, or 3.47% of total commercial loans at December 31, 2024, compared to $508.0 million, or 2.81% of total commercial loans at September 30, 2024. Nonaccrual loans totaled $97.3 million, or 0.42% of total loans at December 31, 2024, compared to $82.9 million, or 0.35% of total loans at September 30, 2024. ORE and foreclosed assets totaled $27.8 million at December 31, 2024, virtually flat compared to September 30, 2024.

Noninterest income totaled $91.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, down $4.7 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2024. Service charges on deposits were up $0.3 million, or 1%, from the third quarter of 2024. Bank card and ATM fees were down $0.2

million, or 1%, from the third quarter of 2024. Investment and annuity fees and insurance commissions were relatively flat linked-quarter. Trust fees were up $0.2 million, or 1%, linked quarter. Fees from secondary mortgage operations totaled $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, down $0.8 million, or 24%, linked-quarter, largely as a result of a higher percentage of loans retained for investment. Other noninterest income was $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, down $4.1 million, or 22% from the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to declines in derivative income and gains on sales of SBA loans.

Noninterest expense totaled $202.3 million, down $1.5 million, or 1%, from the third quarter of 2024. The primary driver of the decrease is attributable to personnel expense, which was down $2.0 million, or 2%, from the third quarter of 2024, driven by lower incentives and retirement benefits expenses.

The effective income tax rate for fourth quarter 2024 was 18.9%. The effective income tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate primarily due to tax-exempt income and income tax credits.

The following table provides selected comparative financial information for the five quarters ending with December 31, 2024.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

The accounting principles we follow and the methods for applying these principles conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and general practices followed by the banking industry. The significant accounting principles and practices we follow are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this document. These principles and practices require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates the estimates and assumptions made on an ongoing basis to help ensure the resulting reported amounts reflect management’s best estimates and judgments given current facts and circumstances. The following discusses certain critical accounting policies that involve a higher degree of management judgment and complexity in producing estimates that may significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is comprised of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans and leases held for investment, and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, a liability established to absorb credit losses for the expected life of the contractual term of on and off-balance sheet exposures as of the date of the determination. Accounting standards require that management incorporate an economic forecast for a reasonable and supportable period, which is two years based on our current policy. We utilize third party forecasts that consist of multiple economic scenarios, including a baseline, with a probability distribution of 50% better or worse economic performance and various upside and downside scenarios utilized at an aggregated state (or regional) levels across our footprint or national level, depending on the portfolio. The economic forecasts are generally lagging and may not incorporate all events and circumstances through the financial statement date.

The Company’s management considers available forecasts, current events not captured and our specific portfolio characteristics and applies weights to the scenario output based on a best estimate of likely outcomes. Changing economic conditions introduce enhanced estimation uncertainty in the forecasts used to estimate expected credit loss. Our credit loss models were built using historical data that may not correlate to existing economic conditions. The estimate of the life of a loan considers both contractual cash flows as well as estimated prepayments and forecasted draws on unfunded loan commitments that were also built on historical data that may react

Table of Contents

differently given the current environment. Such forecasted information is inherently uncertain, therefore, actual results may differ significantly from management’s estimates.

Management applies significant judgment when weighting the macroeconomic scenarios for the reasonable and supportable period. Our assessment considers the scenario description compared to our portfolio performance and benchmarking select variables to other third-party forecasts. At December 31, 2024, the Company weighted the Moody’s baseline scenario at 40% and the mild recessionary S-2 scenario at 60%. Results by scenario can vary significantly from period to period as both the scenario assumptions and the portfolio composition are changing, therefore comparison of scenario weighting from period to period may not be meaningful. For example, holding all other assumptions constant, the slower growth S-2 scenario produced expected credit losses 40% higher than utilization of the baseline scenario at December 31, 2024. In contrast, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the slower growth S-2 scenario produced results 34% higher than the baseline scenario. In addition, these quantitative results are adjusted, sometimes materially, by the qualitative assessment described below.

The quantitative loss rate analysis is supplemented by a review of qualitative factors that considers whether conditions differ from those existing during the historical periods used in the development of the credit loss models. Such factors include, but are not limited to, problem loan trends, changes in loan profiles and volumes, changes in lending policies and procedures, current or expected economic trends, business conditions, credit concentrations, model limitations and other relevant factors not captured by our models. While quantitative data for these factors is used where available, there is significant judgment applied in these processes.

For credits that are individually evaluated, a specific allowance is calculated as the shortfall between the credit’s value and the bank’s exposure. The loan’s value is measured by either the loan’s observable market price, the fair value of the collateral of the loan (less liquidation costs) if it is collateral dependent, or by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. Collateral supporting loans individually evaluated for credit loss may include, but is not limited to, commercial and residential real estate, accounts receivable and other corporate assets. Valuations are highly subjective and based on information available at the time of valuation and the current resolution strategy. These values are difficult to assess and have heightened uncertainty resulting from current market conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Management considers the appropriateness of these critical assumptions as part of its allowance review and believes the ACL level is appropriate based on information available through the financial statement date. Refer to Note 3 – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, included in Part II, Item 8 of this document, for further discussion of significant assumptions used in the current allowance calculation.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Hancock Whitney Corporation has prepared the consolidated financial statements and other information in our Annual Report in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and is responsible for its accuracy. The financial statements necessarily include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.

In meeting its responsibility, management relies on internal accounting and related control systems. The internal control systems are designed to ensure that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in the Company’s financial records and to safeguard the Company’s assets from material loss or misuse. Such assurance cannot be absolute because of inherent limitations in any internal control system.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Rule 13(a)–15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management also conducted an assessment of requirements pertaining to Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. This section relates to management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) and in compliance with laws and regulations. Our evaluation included a review of the documentation of controls, evaluations of the design of the internal control system and tests of the effectiveness of internal controls.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

Based on the Company’s evaluation under the framework in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hancock Whitney Corporation

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hancock Whitney Corporation and its subsidiaries

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024

and

2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024,

including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated

financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (
2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024

and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2024

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s

Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated

financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management’s assessment and our audit of Hancock Whitney Corporation's internal control over financial reporting also included controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) to comply with the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

82

Table of Contents

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the

consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Credit Losses for the Collectively Evaluated Portfolios

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) is comprised of the allowance for loan and lease losses, a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans and leases held for investment, and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, a liability established to absorb credit losses for the expected life of the contractual term of on and off-balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2024, the total allowance for credit losses was $343 million on total loans of $23.3 billion. The analysis and methodology for estimating the ACL includes two primary elements: a collective approach for pools of loans that have similar risk characteristics using a loss rate analysis, and a specific reserve analysis for credits individually evaluated for credit loss. Management utilizes internally developed credit models and third-party economic forecasts for the calculation of expected credit loss for the collectively evaluated portfolios. Management calculates a collective allowance for a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing probability weighted multiple macroeconomic scenarios, and then reverts on a linear basis over four quarters to an average historical loss rate for the remaining term. Qualitative adjustments to the output of quantitative calculations are made when management deems it necessary to reflect differences in current and forecasted conditions as compared to those during the historical loss period used in model development.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for credit losses for the collectively evaluated portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the application of probability weighted multiple macroeconomic scenarios and the qualitative adjustments used in estimating the allowance for credit losses and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s process for estimating the allowance for credit losses for the collectively evaluated portfolios, including controls over the application of probability weighted multiple macroeconomic scenarios and qualitative adjustments. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for credit losses by (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology, (ii) testing certain data used in the estimate, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the application of probability weighted multiple macroeconomic scenarios and the qualitative adjustments; professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing these procedures to test management’s process.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Hancock Whitney Corporation (the “Company”) is a financial services company headquartered in Gulfport, Mississippi that is both a financial holding company and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company provides a comprehensive and fully integrated suite of financial choices to customers through its bank subsidiary, Hancock Whitney Bank (the “Bank”), a Mississippi state bank. The Bank offers a broad range of traditional and online banking services to commercial, small business and retail customers, providing a variety of transaction and savings deposit products, treasury management services, secured and unsecured loan products (including revolving credit facilities), and letters of credit and similar financial guarantees. The Bank also provides access to trust and investment management services to retirement plans, corporations and individuals, as well as investment advisory and brokerage products. In addition, the Company offers its customers access to fixed annuity and life insurance products and investment management and other services through its limited purpose broker-dealer subsidiary, Hancock Whitney Investment Services, Inc., a nonbank subsidiary of the holding company. The Company primarily operates across the Gulf South region, including southern and central Mississippi; southern and central Alabama; southern, central and northwest Louisiana; the northern, central, and panhandle regions of Florida; and the certain areas of east and northeast Texas. In addition, the Company operates loan and deposit production offices in the metropolitan areas of Nashville, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) and those generally practiced within the banking industry. Following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all other entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. Variable interest entities for which the Company has been deemed the primary beneficiary are also consolidated. Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Use of Estimates

The accounting principles the Company follows and the methods for applying these principles conform to U.S. GAAP and general practices followed by the banking industry. These accounting principles and practices require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value Accounting

Fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. U.S. GAAP requires the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in the financial statements, as well as for specific disclosures about certain assets and liabilities.

Accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to these valuation techniques used to measure fair value giving preference to quoted prices in active markets (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs such as a reporting entity’s own data or information or assumptions developed from this data (level 3). Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, observable inputs other than quoted prices, such as interest rates and yield curves, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

90

Table of Contents

Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Purchased assets, including identifiable intangibles, and assumed liabilities are recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values. If the fair value of net assets purchased exceeds the consideration given, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. If the consideration given exceeds the fair value of the net assets received or if the fair value of the net liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration received, goodwill is recognized. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to 
one year
 after the closing date of an acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

All identifiable intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination are recognized at the acquisition date fair value. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or if they are separable (i.e., capable of being sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged separately from the entity).

Cash and Due from Banks
The Company considers only cash on hand, cash items in process of collection and noninterest-bearing balances due from financial institutions as cash and due from banks.
Securities

Securities are classified as trading, held to maturity or available for sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates this classification periodically as conditions change that could require reclassification.

Available for sale securities are stated at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and unrealized holding losses are reported net of tax in other comprehensive income or loss and in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) until realized.

Securities that the Company both positively intends and has the ability to hold to maturity are classified as securities held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. The intent and ability to hold are not considered satisfied when a security is available to be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates, liquidity needs or other reasons as part of an overall asset/liability management strategy.

Premiums and discounts on securities, both those held to maturity and those available for sale, are amortized and accreted to income as an adjustment to the securities’ yields using the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are reported net as a component of noninterest income. The cost of securities sold is specifically identified for use in calculating realized gains and losses.

Credit Losses on Securities
At least quarterly, or more often when warranted, the Company performs an assessment of held to maturity debt securities for expected credit losses and available for sale debt securities for credit-related impairment, resulting in an allowance for credit losses, if applicable. The Company applies the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest receivable balance from amortized cost basis of securities. The allowance for credit losses on held to maturity debt securities is estimated at the individual security level when there is a more than inconsequential risk of default. The assessment uses probability of default and loss given default models based on public ratings, where available, or mapped internally developed risk grades to public ratings and forecasted cash flows using the same economic forecasts and probability weighting as used for the Company’s evaluation of the loan portfolio. Qualitative adjustments to the output of the quantitative calculation are made when management deems it necessary to reflect differences in current and forecasted conditions as compared to those during the historical loss period used in model development. The Company evaluates credit impairment on available for sale debt securities at an individual security level. This evaluation is done for securities whose fair value is below amortized cost with a more than inconsequential risk of default and where the Company has assessed the decline in fair value is significant enough to suggest a credit event occurred. Credit events are generally assessed based on adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area, changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors. The allowance for credit losses for such securities is measured using a discounted cash flow methodology, through which management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The allowance for credit loss is limited to the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.
The Company records changes in the allowance for credit losses on securities with a corresponding adjustment recorded in the provision for credit loss expense. If the Company intends to sell the debt security, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is charged down to fair value against the allowance for credit losses, with any incremental impairment reported in earnings.

Loans

Loans Held for Sale

Residential mortgage loans originated for sale are classified as loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company generally elects the fair value option on funded residential mortgage loans originated for sale that are associated with forward sales contracts. For mortgage loans for which the Company has elected the fair value option, gains and losses are included in noninterest income within secondary mortgage market operations.
Held for sale loans also includes residential construction loans that are anticipated to be sold upon completion of the construction term. At times, management may originate other types of loans with the intent to sell or decide to sell loans that were not originated for that purpose. Such loans are reclassified as held for sale at the lower of cost or market when that decision is made.
Loans Held for Investment
Loans that the Company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are considered loans held for investment and reported as loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the related footnote disclosures. Loans held for investment include loans originated for investment and loans acquired in purchase transactions.
Loans are reported at the principal balance outstanding net of unearned income. Interest on loans and accretion of unearned income, including net deferred loan fees and costs, are computed in a manner that approximates a level yield on recorded principal. Interest on loans is recognized in income as earned.

The accrual of interest is discontinued (“nonaccrual status”) when, in management’s opinion, it is probable that the borrower will be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. When accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed and payments subsequently received are applied first to recover principal. Interest income is recognized for payments received after contractual principal has been satisfied. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest contractually due are brought current and future payment performance is reasonably assured.
Acquired Loans

Acquired loans are segregated between those purchased with credit deterioration (PCD) and those that are not (non-PCD). Loans considered PCD include those individual loans (or groups of loans with similar risk characteristics) that as of the date of acquisition are assessed as having experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. The assessment of what is more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination considers information including, but not limited to, financial assets that are delinquent, on nonaccrual and/or otherwise adversely risk rated as of the acquisition date, those that have been downgraded since origination, and those for which, after origination, credit spreads have widened beyond the threshold specified in policy. The Company bifurcates the fair value discount between the credit and noncredit components and records an allowance for credit losses for PCD loans by adding the credit portion of the fair value discount to the initial amortized cost basis and increasing the allowance for credit losses at the date of acquisition. Any noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring loans with credit deterioration is allocated to each individual asset. All non-PCD loans acquired are recorded at the estimated fair value of the loan at acquisition, with the estimated allowance for credit loss recorded as a provision for credit losses through earnings in the period in which the acquisition has occurred. The noncredit discount or premium for PCD loans and full discount for non-PCD loans will be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate at the acquisition date.
Modifications of Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulties and Troubled Debt Restructurings
As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loans and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. As described in the "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" that appears later in this footnote, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, effective January 1, 2023, that requires monitoring and reporting of qualifying modifications, including renewals and refinancings where the borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties (MEFDs). Qualifying modifications are interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions, or any combination of these terms. Our MEFD policy generally considers six months or less to be the time frame that is considered insignificant for payment delays and/or term extensions. Multiple payment delays and/or term extensions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty within a twelve-month period are evaluated collectively. Qualifying modified loans are subject to reporting requirements for the twelve-month period following the modification. This standard was adopted on a prospective basis and therefore, only modifications on or after January 1, 2023 are evaluated and reported under the new requirements.

MEFDs can remain on nonaccrual, move to nonaccrual, return to accrual, or continue to accrue interest, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. The Company has elected to evaluate these modified loans for credit loss consistent with

92

Table of Contents

policies for the non-modified portfolio, which includes individually evaluating for specific reserves all nonaccrual MEFDs over our existing materiality threshold and collectively evaluating credit loss for all other MEFDs, including those that continue to accrue interest. The credit loss methodology for MEFDs is the same as described in the Allowance for Credit Losses section that follows.

Prior to January 1, 2023, troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) occurred when a borrower was experiencing, or was expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near-term and a modification of loan terms was granted that would otherwise not have been considered. Like MEFDs, troubled debt restructurings resulted in loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing to accrue, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. When establishing credit reserves on a loan modified in a TDR, the loan’s value was determined by either the present value of expected cash flows calculated using the loan’s effective interest rate before the restructuring, or the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan was collateral dependent. If the value as determined was less than the recorded investment in the loan, the difference was charged off through the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is comprised of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans and leases held for investment, and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, a liability established to absorb credit losses for the expected life of the contractual term of on and off-balance sheet exposures as of the date of the determination. Quarterly, management estimates losses in the portfolio and unfunded exposures based on a number of factors, including the Company’s past loan loss experience, known and potential risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers’ ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, and current and forecasted economic conditions.
The analysis and methodology for estimating the ACL includes two primary elements: a collective approach for pools of loans that have similar risk characteristics using a loss rate analysis, and a specific reserve analysis for credits individually evaluated for credit loss. For the collective approach, the Company segments loans into commercial non-real estate, commercial real estate – owner occupied, commercial real estate – income producing, construction and land development, residential mortgage and consumer, with further segmentation by region and sub-portfolio, as deemed appropriate. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are applied at the portfolio segment levels. The Company applies the practical expedient that permits the exclusion of the accrued interest receivable balance from amortized cost basis of financing receivables for all classes of loans as our nonaccrual policy results in the timely write-off of interest accrued but uncollected.
For the collectively evaluated portfolios, the Company utilizes internally developed credit models and third party economic forecasts for the calculation of expected credit loss over the reasonable and supportable forecast period for the majority of the portfolio and other methods, generally historical loss based, for select portfolios. The Company calculates a collective allowance for a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing probability weighted multiple macroeconomic scenarios, and then reverts on a linear basis over four quarters to an average historical loss rate for the remaining term. The credit models consist primarily of multivariate regression and autoregressive models that correlate our historical net charge-off rates to select macroeconomic variables at a collective level. Forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts are applied as inputs to the regression equations to estimate quarterly collective net charge-off rates over the reasonable and supportable period. The net charge-off rates from the credit models for the reasonable and supportable period, the linear reversion rates, and the average loss rates for the post reasonable and supportable periods are applied to forecasted balance runoff for the estimated remaining term. The balance runoff incorporates prepayment assumptions developed from historical experience that are applied to the multiple macroeconomic forecasts. Forecasted net charge-off rates are also applied to forecasted draws and subsequent runoff of unfunded commitments in the calculation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Qualitative adjustments to the output of quantitative calculations are made when management deems it necessary to reflect differences in current and forecasted conditions as compared to those during the historical loss period used in model development. Conditions to be considered include, but are not limited to, problem loan trends, current business and economic conditions, credit concentrations, lending policies and procedures, lending staff, collateral values, loan profiles and volumes, loan review quality, changes in competition and regulations, and other adjustments for model limitations or other variables not specifically captured.
The 
Company establishes specific reserves using an individually evaluated approach for nonaccrual loans and, prior to January 1, 2023, loans modified in troubled debt restructures and loans for which a troubled debt restructure was reasonably expected, as well as any other financial instruments that are deemed to not share risk characteristics with other collectively evaluated financial assets. For loans individually evaluated, a specific allowance is recognized for any shortfall between the loan’s value and its recorded investment. The loan’s value is measured by either the loan’s observable market price, the fair value of the collateral of the loan (less liquidation costs) if it is collateral dependent, or by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. The Company applies the practical expedient and defines collateral dependent loans as those where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and on which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. Loans individually analyzed are not incorporated into the pool analysis to avoid double counting. The Company limits the individually

evaluated 
specific reserve analysis to include commercial and residential mortgage loans with relationship balances of $
1
 million or greater and, prior to January 1, 2023, all loans classified as troubled debt restructurings.
It is the policy of the Company to promptly charge off all commercial and residential mortgage loans, or portions of loans, when available information reasonably confirms that they are wholly or partially uncollectible. Prior to recording a charge, the loan’s value is established based on an assessment of the value of the collateral securing the loan, the borrower’s and the guarantor’s ability and willingness to pay and the status of the account in bankruptcy court, if applicable. Consumer loans are generally charged down when the loan is 120 days past due for most secured and unsecured loans and 150 days past due for consumer credit card loans, unless the loan is clearly both well secured and in the process of collection. Loans are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, if any, less estimated selling costs. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses, with subsequent recoveries added back to the allowance.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is charged to expense using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are up to 
30 years
 for buildings and 
three
 to 
ten years
 for most furniture and equipment. Amortization expense for software is generally charged over 
three years
, or
 seven years
 for core systems. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. The Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that such long-lived assets have been impaired. Measurement of any impairment of such long-lived assets is based on their fair values.

Property and equipment used in operations is considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.
 Gains and losses related to retirement or disposition of property and equipment are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as realized, reflected in either other income under noninterest income or other expense under noninterest expense, depending on the nature of the item.
Operating Leases
The Company recognizes a liability representing the present value of future lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and assesses the appropriate classification as finance or operating. Operating leases with terms greater than one year are included in right-of-use lease assets and lease obligations on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The lease term includes payments to be made in optional or renewal periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the contract, when available, or the Company’s incremental collateralized borrowing rate with similar terms. Agreements with both lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately, with only the lease component capitalized. The right-of-use asset is the amount of the lease liability adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, remaining balance of any lease incentives received, unamortized initial direct costs, and impairment. Lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term through amortization of the right-of-use asset plus implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability obligation, and is reflected in net occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate right-of-use assets have been impaired. Measurement of any impairment of such assets is based on their fair values. Once a right-of-use asset for an operating lease is impaired, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced through expense and the remaining balance is subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis.
Certain of the Company’s leases contain variable components, such as annual changes to rent based on the consumer price index. Operating lease liabilities are not re-measured as a result of changes to variable components unless the lease must be re-measured for some other reason such as a renewal that was not reasonably certain of being exercised. Changes to the variable components are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.

As allowed in the transition guidance in Topic 842, "Leases," the Company elected to use the standard’s “package of practical expedients,” which allows the use of previous conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and the accounting treatment for initial direct costs. The Company also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases with lease terms of one year or less; as such, the Company does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet for such leases.

Other Real Estate and Foreclosed Assets
Other real estate and foreclosed assets includes real property and other assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of loans and leases, and real property no longer used in the Bank’s business. These assets are recorded at the estimated fair value less the estimated cost of disposition and carried at the lower of either cost or market. Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors. Any initial reduction in the carrying amount of a loan to the fair value of the collateral received less selling costs is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Each asset is revalued on an annual basis, or more often if market conditions necessitate. Subsequent losses on the periodic revaluation of these assets and gains or losses recognized on disposition are charged to current earnings, as are revenues from and costs of operating and maintaining real property; with the resulting net (income) expense reflected in noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Improvements made to real property are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon the sale of the property.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired or the excess of the fair value liabilities assumed over consideration received in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. Accounting guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book value, then a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, or concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. In addition, absent any triggering events, quantitative impairment test will be performed every three years to ensure goodwill is periodically reviewed within a reasonable timeframe. The quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value. The Company has assigned all goodwill to one reporting unit that represents overall banking operations. The fair value of the reporting unit is based on valuation techniques that market participants would use in an acquisition of the whole unit, and may include analysis such as estimated discounted cash flows, the quoted market price of the Company’s stock adjusted for a control premium, and observable average price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of competitors. If the unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, an estimate of the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the goodwill’s carrying value, and any impairment is recognized.
Other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, customer lists and trade names, are initially recorded at fair value and are generally amortized over the periods benefited. These assets are evaluated for impairment in a similar manner to long-lived assets.

Life Insurance Contracts
Bank-owned life insurance contracts (BOLI) are comprised of long-term life insurance contracts on the lives of certain current and past employees where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by the employer. Its cash surrender value is an asset that the Company uses to partially offset the future cost of employee benefits. The cash value accumulation on BOLI is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the insured person’s death and certain other conditions are met.

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock
As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), the Company is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to a membership investment plus an activity-based investment determined according to the level of outstanding FHLB advances. The shares are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and is reflected in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as components of other assets and other liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.

95

Table of Contents

For derivatives designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability (fair value hedge), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of the fair value change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. Derivatives designated as hedging exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge), are reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings or, in certain circumstances, when the hedge is terminated, with the full impact of hedge gains and losses recognized in the period in which the hedged transaction impacts the entity’s earnings. For derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately. Note 11 - Derivatives describes the derivative instruments currently used by the Company and discloses how these derivatives impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Stockholders’ Equity
Common stock reflects shares issued at par value. Repurchase of the Company’s common stock (treasury stock) is recorded at cost as a reduction of stockholders’ equity within capital surplus in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity. When treasury shares are subsequently reissued, treasury stock is reduced by the cost of such stock using the first-in-first-out method, with the difference recorded in capital surplus or retained earnings, as applicable.
Revenue Recognition

Interest Income
Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis driven by written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities contracts. Loan origination fees and costs are recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to yield. Unamortized premiums, discounts and other basis adjustments on loans and investment securities are recognized in interest income as a yield adjustment over the contractual lives. However, premiums for certain callable investment securities are amortized to the earliest call date.
Service Charges on Deposit Accounts
Service charges on deposit accounts include transaction-based fees for nonsufficient funds, account analysis fees, and other service charges on deposits, including monthly account service fees. Nonsufficient funds fees are recognized at the time when the account overdraft occurs in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Account analysis fees consist of fees charged on certain business deposit accounts based upon account activity as well as other monthly account fees, and are recorded under the accrual method of accounting as services are performed.
Other service charges are earned by providing depositors safeguard and remittance of funds as well as by providing other elective services for depositors that are performed upon the depositor’s request. Charges for deposit services for the safeguard and remittance of funds are recognized at the end of the statement cycle, after services are provided, as the customer retains funds in the account. Revenue for other elective services is earned at the point in time the customer uses the service.
Trust Fees
Trust fee income represents revenue generated from asset management services provided to individuals, businesses, and institutions. The Company has a fiduciary responsibility to the beneficiary of the trust to perform agreed upon services which can include investing assets, periodic reporting, and providing tax information regarding the trust. In exchange for these trust and custodial services, the Company collects fee income from beneficiaries as contractually determined via fee schedules. The Company’s performance obligation is primarily satisfied over time as the services are performed and provided to the customer. These fees are recorded under the accrual method of accounting as the services are performed. The Company generally acts as the principal in these transactions and records revenue and expenses on a gross basis.

Bank Card and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Fees
Bank card and ATM fees include credit card, debit card and ATM transaction revenue. The majority of this revenue is card interchange fees earned through a third-party network. Performance obligations are satisfied for each transaction when the card is used and the funds are remitted. The network establishes interchange fees that the merchant remits for each transaction, and costs are incurred from the network for facilitating the interchange with the merchant. Card fees also include merchant services fees earned for providing merchants with card processing capabilities.

ATM income is generated from allowing customers to withdraw funds from other banks’ machines and from allowing a non-customer cardholder to withdraw funds from the Company’s machines. The Company satisfies its performance obligations for each transaction at the point in time that the withdrawal is processed.

96

Table of Contents

Bank card and ATM fee income is recorded on accrual basis as services are provided with the related expense reflected in data processing expense.
Investment and Annuity Fees and Insurance Commissions
Investment and annuity services fee income represents income earned from investment and advisory services. The Company provides its customers with access to investment products through the use of third-party carriers to meet their financial needs and investment objectives. Upon selection of an investment product, the customer enters into a policy with the carrier. The performance obligation is satisfied by fulfilling its responsibility to process the order to acquire the investment for which a commission fee is earned from either the carrier or our third-party service provider based on agreed-upon fee percentages on a trade date basis, net of any associated costs. The Company has a contractual relationship with a third-party broker dealer to provide full-service brokerage and investment advisory activities. As the agent in the arrangement, the Company recognizes the investment services commissions on a net basis. Investment revenue also includes portfolio management fees, which represent monthly fees charged on a contractual basis to customers for the management of their investment portfolios and are recorded under the accrual method of accounting. Prior to August 12, 2022, investment and annuity services fee income was recorded on a gross basis, with expenses recorded in the appropriate expense line item; subsequent to that date, such fee income is recorded net of expenses, as the Company is now agent in these transactions following a change in service providers.

This revenue line item includes investment banking income, which includes fees for services arising from securities offerings or placements in which the Company acts as a principal. Revenue is recognized at the time the underwriting is completed and the revenue is reasonably determinable. Any costs associated with these transactions are reflected in the appropriate expense line item.
Insurance commission revenue is recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy, as the Company’s performance obligation is connecting the customer to the insurance products. Until August 12, 2022, the Company also received contingent commissions from insurance companies as additional incentive for achieving specified premium volume goals and/or the loss experience of the insurance placed. Those fees are no longer earned following the change in service providers. Those contingent commissions from insurance companies as well as fees for policy renewals are recognized when determinable, which is generally when such commissions are received or when we receive data from the insurance companies and/or our third-party service provider that allows the reasonable estimation of these amounts. Prior to August 12, 2022, costs associated with these transactions were reflected in the appropriate expense line item; subsequent to that date, with the change in service providers, the Company is now agent in these transactions and expenses are recorded net in this revenue line item.
Secondary Mortgage Market Operations
Secondary mortgage market operations revenue is primarily comprised of service release premiums earned on the sale of closed-end mortgage loans to other financial institutions or government agencies that are recognized in revenue as each sales transaction occurs. This revenue line item also includes derivative income associated with our mortgage banking operations. Refer to Note 11 – Derivatives for a discussion of these derivative instruments.

Securities Transactions
Securities transactions include net realized gain (losses) on securities sold reflecting the excess (deficiency) of proceeds received over the specifically identified carrying amount of the assets being sold plus cost to sell. Securities sales are recorded as each transaction occurs on a trade-date basis.
Income from Bank-Owned Life Insurance
Bank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. Revenue from the proceeds of insurance benefits is recognized at the time a claim is confirmed.
Credit Related Fees

Credit-related fee income is primarily composed of letter of credit fees and unused commercial commitment fees. Revenue for letters of credit fees is recognized over time. Revenue for unused commercial commitment fees are recognized based on contractual terms, generally when collected.

Table of Contents

Income from Derivatives
Income from derivatives consists primarily of income from interest rate swaps, net of fair value adjustments for customer derivatives and the related offsetting agreements with unrelated financial institutions for which the derivative instruments are not designated as hedges.
Net Gains on Sales of Premises, Equipment and Other Assets
Net gains on sales of premises, equipment and other assets consists primarily of net revenue earned from sales of excess-bank owned facilities and equipment no longer in use, gains on sales of non-residential mortgage loans and leases and other assets associated with the equipment finance line of business. Gains or losses are generally recognized when the asset has been legally transferred to the buyer, net of costs to sell.
Other Miscellaneous Income
Other miscellaneous income represents a variety of revenue streams, including safe deposit box income, wire transfer fees, syndication fees, and any other income not reflected above. Income is recorded once the performance obligation is satisfied, generally on the accrual basis or on a cash basis if not material and/or considered constrained.

Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and recorded as a component of noninterest expense.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Current tax liabilities or assets are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable or refundable on tax returns to be filed with respect to the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the assets will not be realized. The benefit of a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on its technical merits. The effects of changes in tax rates and laws upon deferred tax balances are recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted.

The Company makes investments that generate solar investment tax credits (solar ITC). The Company uses the deferral method of accounting for solar ITC investments whereby the tax benefit from the investment tax credits is recognized as a reduction of the book basis of the related asset and is amortized into income over the tax life of the underlying investment.
The Company also made investments in projects that yield tax credits issued under the Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZAB) and Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCB) prior to December 31, 2017, as well as Federal and State New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) programs. Returns on these investments are generated through the receipt of federal and state tax credits. The tax credits are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision in the year that they are earned. Tax credits from QZAB and QSCB bonds are generally earned over the life of the bonds in lieu of interest income. Credits on Federal NMTC investments are earned over the seven- year compliance period beginning with the year of investment. Credits on State NMTC investments are generally earned over a three to five-year period depending upon the specific state program. The Company has elected not to apply the proportional amortization method to the qualifying NMTC program for any existing and future eligible investments. As such, any investment income, gains and losses, and tax credits will continue to be presented gross in statement of income, where income and gains and losses on the investment are reported as a component of pre-tax book income/loss while the tax credits are reported as a component of income tax expense. The election for any eligible future investments in other tax credit programs will be made at the time of investment.
The Company also invests in affordable housing projects that generate low-income tax credits (LIHTC) that are earned over a 10-year period, beginning with the year the rental activity begins. The Company has elected to use the practical expedient method to amortize the investment cost, which approximates the proportional amortization method, over the 
10-year
 tax credit period.

With the exception of QZAB and QSCB tax credits, all of the tax credits described above can be carried back 
one-year
 and carried forward 
20
 years if the credit cannot be fully used in the year the credits first become available for use. QZAB and QSCB tax credits generally can be carried forward indefinitely if they cannot be fully used in the year the credits are generated.

Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and certain other defined benefit postretirement plans for eligible employees. The amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements with respect to these plans are based on actuarial valuations that incorporate various assumptions regarding future experience under the plans. Note 17 – Retirement Benefit Plans discusses the actuarial assumptions and provides information about the liabilities or assets recognized for the funded status of the Company’s obligations under these plans, the net benefit expense charged to current operations, and the amounts recognized as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and AOCI.

Share-Based Payment Arrangements

The grant date fair value of equity instruments awarded to employees and directors establishes the cost of the services received in exchange, and the cost associated with awards that are expected to vest is recognized over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation for service-based awards that contain a graded vesting schedule is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures of unvested awards are recognized in earnings in the period in which they occur. Refer to Note 18 – Share-Based Payment Arrangements for additional information.
Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

The Company computes earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method. The two-class method allocates net income to each class of common stock and participating security according to the common dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For reporting periods in which a net loss is recorded, net loss is not allocated to participating securities because the holders of such securities bear no contractual obligation to fund or otherwise share in the loss. Participating securities currently consist of unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents.

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Shares outstanding exclude treasury shares and unvested share-based payment awards under long-term incentive compensation plans and directors’ compensation plans. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding increased by (1) the number of shares in which employees would vest under performance-based stock awards and stock unit awards based on expected performance factors and (2) the number of additional shares that would have been issued if potentially dilutive stock options were exercised; each as determined using the treasury stock method. For reporting periods in which a net loss is recorded, 
no
 effect is given to potentially dilutive shares as the impact of such shares would be anti-dilutive.

Reportable Segment Disclosures

U.S. GAAP requires that information be reported about a company’s operating segments using a “management approach.” Reportable segments are identified in these standards as those revenue-producing components for which discrete financial information is produced internally and which are subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The Company’s stated strategy is to provide a consistent package of banking products and services throughout a coherent market area; as such, the Company has identified its overall banking operations as its only reportable segment. Because the overall banking operations comprise substantially all of the Company’s consolidated operations, no separate financial segment disclosures are presented. See additional segment disclosure information in Note 16 – Segment Reporting.
Other

Assets held by the Bank in a fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Bank and are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2024
In March 2023, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-02, “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method,” to allow reporting entities to have the option to elect and expand the use of the proportional amortization method of accounting for qualifying tax credit equity investments structures that meet certain criteria. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2024, and has elected not to apply the proportional amortization method to the new market tax program, which includes our existing qualifying new market tax credit investments. The election for any eligible future investments in other tax credit programs will be made at the time of investment. The adoption of this standard had no impact to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” 
The 
amendments in this update improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced

disclosures 
about significant segment expenses and other information, including disclosure of the title and position of the 
chief operating decision maker
 (CODM) and an explanation of how the CODM uses reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
 In addition, the update requires entities that have identified a single reportable segment to provide disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this standard effective December 31, 2024 and included the required disclosures in Note 16 –Segment Reporting. As the update contains only amendments to disclosure requirements, adoption had no impact to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023 and 2022
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, "Financial Instruments: Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures." The amendments in this update cover two matters: (1) the elimination of TDR recognition and measurement guidance as prescribed by ASC 310-40 and introduced new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty; and (2) for public business entities, the requirement that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables in the vintage disclosures required for public business entities. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2023, on a prospective basis for all amendments. The adoption of this standard was not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See further discussion of the resulting changes to our policies in the “Modifications of loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulties and Troubled Debt Restructurings” section of this Note and required disclosures in Note 3 – Loans.
The following additional standards were applicable to the Company and adopted in 2023 and 2022 but did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operation:
•
ASU 2022-01, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method"
•
ASU 2022-06, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848"

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted

The following accounting standards were issued and applicable to the Company but have not yet been adopted, and are either not expected to have a material impact to its consolidated financial position or results of operations or only impacts disclosure requirements:
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, “Disclosure Improvements,” to modify the disclosure or presentation requirements related to various subtopics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The ASU was issued in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) August 2018 final rule that updated and simplified disclosure requirements that the SEC believed were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or superseded. The amendments in this update are intended to align U.S. GAAP requirements with those of the SEC and to facilitate the application of U.S. GAAP for all entities. The amendments in this update add 14 of the 27 disclosure or presentation requirements identified in the SEC’s final rule to the Codification. However, each amendment in the ASU will only become effective if the SEC removes the related disclosure or presentation requirement from its existing regulations by June 30, 2027. For entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosure requirements, such as the Company, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the provision of this guidance, but expects any applicable provisions to affect only presentation or disclosure and, therefore, have no effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures," to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes to be included in the rate reconciliation and by requiring more detail to be disclosed on certain reconciling item categories that meet a quantitative threshold. Additionally, the amendment requires all entities to annually disclose disaggregated information about income taxes paid using specific quantitative thresholds and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the amendments on a prospective basis and retrospective application is permitted. As the update contains only amendments to disclosure requirements, adoption will have no impact to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In November 
2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40),” to improve the disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The amendments in this update require disclosure of specified information about certain costs and

Table of Contents

expenses 
in the notes to financial statements. Disclosure requirements also include a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, among other items. An entity is not precluded from providing additional voluntary disclosures that may provide investors with additional decision-useful information. This update, as amended, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this update, or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the provisions of this guidance. As the update contains only amendments to disclosure requirements, adoption will have no impact to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company transferred securities with an aggregate fair value of $
561.8
 million, inclusive of an unrealized loss of $
15.4
 million, from the available for sale portfolio to the held to maturity portfolio; as such, the securities were recorded with an amortized cost of $
561.8
 million within the held to maturity portfolio. The unrealized loss is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest income over the remaining lives of the securities. There were 
no
 such transfers in 2024 or 2023.
Securities with carrying values totaling approximately $
3.9
 billion at December 31, 2024 and $
4.7
 billion at December 31, 2023 were pledged as collateral, primarily to secure public deposits or securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Credit Quality
The Company’s policy is to invest only in securities of investment grade quality. These investments are largely limited to U.S. agency securities and municipal securities. Management has concluded, based on the long history of no credit losses, that the expectation of nonpayment of the held to maturity securities carried at amortized cost is zero for securities that are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. As such, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. The municipal portfolio is analyzed separately for allowance for credit loss in accordance with the applicable guidance for each portfolio as noted below.

The Company evaluates credit impairment for individual securities available for sale whose fair value was below amortized cost with a more than inconsequential risk of default and where the Company had assessed whether the decline in fair value was significant enough to suggest a credit event occurred. There were 
no
 securities with a material credit loss event and therefore, 
no
 allowance for credit loss was recorded in any period presented.

The fair value and gross unrealized losses for securities classified as available for sale with unrealized losses at December 31, 2024 are presented in the table below.

At each reporting period, the Company evaluated its held to maturity municipal obligation portfolio for credit loss using probability of default and loss given default models. The models were run using a long-term average probability of default migration and with a probability weighting of Moody’s economic forecasts. The resulting credit losses, if any, were negligible and no allowance for credit loss was recorded.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
729
 and 
698
 securities, respectively, with market values below their cost basis. There were no material unrealized losses related to the marketability of the securities or the issuer’s ability to meet contractual obligations. In all cases, the indicated impairment on these debt securities would be recovered no later than the security’s maturity date or possibly earlier if the market price for the security increases with a reduction in the yield required by the market. The unrealized losses were deemed to be non-credit related at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company had adequate liquidity and, therefore, neither planned to nor expected to be required to liquidate these securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis.

Note 3. Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company generally makes loans in its market areas of southern and central Mississippi; southern and central Alabama; northwest, central and southern Louisiana; the northern, central and panhandle regions of Florida; certain areas of east and northeast Texas; and the metropolitan areas of Nashville, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, and to a lesser degree, the Bank makes loans both regionally and nationally, generally through its specialty lines of business, including the equipment finance, commercial real estate and healthcare segments, often with sponsors in our market areas.
The following table presents loans at their amortized cost basis, by portfolio class at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The amortized cost basis is net of unearned income and excludes accrued interest totaling $
109.8
 million and $
124.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accrued interest is reflected in the accrued interest line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following briefly describes the composition of each loan category and portfolio class.
Commercial and industrial
Commercial and industrial loans are made available to businesses for working capital (including financing of inventory and receivables), for business expansion, facilitating the acquisition of a business, and for the purchase of equipment and machinery, including equipment leasing. These loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, when secured, have the added strength of the underlying collateral.
Commercial non-real estate loans may be secured by the assets being financed or other tangible or intangible business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, ownership, enterprise value or commodity interests, and may incorporate a personal or corporate guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, including a small portfolio of corporate credit cards, generally issued as a part of overall customer relationships.
Commercial real estate – owner occupied loans consist of commercial mortgages on properties where repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities of the borrower. Like commercial non-real estate, these loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower, but also have the added strength of the value of underlying real estate collateral.
Commercial real estate – income producing
Commercial real estate – income producing loans consist of loans secured by commercial mortgages on properties where the loan is made to real estate developers or investors and repayment is dependent on the sale, refinance, or income generated from the operation of the property. Properties financed include multifamily, retail, healthcare related facilities, industrial, office, hotel/motel and restaurants, and other commercial properties.
Construction and land development
Construction and land development loans are made to facilitate the acquisition, development, improvement and construction of both commercial and residential-purpose properties. Such loans are made to builders and investors where repayment is expected to be made

104

Table of Contents

from the sale, refinance or operation of the property or to businesses to be used in their business operations. This portfolio also includes residential construction loans and loans secured by raw land not yet under development.
Residential mortgages
Residential mortgages consist of closed-end loans secured by first liens on 1- 4 family residential properties. The portfolio includes both fixed and adjustable-rate loans, although most longer-term, fixed-rate loans originated are generally sold in the secondary mortgage market.

Consumer
Consumer loans include second lien mortgage home loans, home equity lines of credit and nonresidential consumer purpose loans. Nonresidential consumer loans include both direct and indirect loans. Direct nonresidential consumer loans are made to finance the purchase of personal property, including automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, and for other personal purposes (secured and unsecured), and also include deposit account secured loans. Indirect nonresidential consumer loans include automobile financing provided to the consumer through an agreement with automobile dealerships, though the Company is no longer engaged in this type of lending and the remaining portfolio is in runoff. Consumer loans also include a small portfolio of credit card receivables issued on the basis of applications received through referrals from the Bank’s branches, online and other marketing efforts.
The Bank makes loans in the normal course of business to directors and executive officers of the Company and the Bank and to their associates. Loans to such related parties are made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated parties and do not involve more than normal risk of collectability when originated. Balances of loans to the Company’s directors, executive officers and their associates at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $
46.2
 million and $
23.5
 million, respectively.
 Related party loan activity in 2024 reflect new loans of $
25.7
 million, repayments of $
17.1
 million, and a net increase of $
14.1
 million related to changes in directors and executive officers and their associates.
The Bank has a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas that is secured by blanket pledges of certain qualifying loan types. The Bank had 
no
 borrowings on this line at December 31, 2024

and $
0.7
 billion at December 31,2023.
LIBOR Transition
Effective July 1, 2023, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is no longer a representative rate for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month settings. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”), signed into law in March of 2022, offered a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing LIBOR’s cessation by outlining a uniform process to govern the transition from LIBOR to a replacement rate. The Federal Reserve Bank Board, authorized under the LIBOR Act to issue appropriate and necessary regulations to administer and carry out the purposes of the Act, issued final regulations which became effective on February 27, 2023. Under the LIBOR Act and the related regulations, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (CME Term SOFR) plus a tenor spread adjustment was designated as the replacement reference rate for instruments that previously referenced LIBOR.
Effective July 3, 2023, approximately $
3.1
 billion of variable rate loans tied to LIBOR were transitioned in accordance with the statutory framework established by the Federal Reserve, with the transition rate to be utilized upon the next reset period, in a manner that is consistent with industry practice. There was no material financial impact from this transition on the Company’s operating results for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.

Table of Contents

The calculation of the allowance for credit losses is performed using two primary approaches: a collective approach for pools of loans that have similar risk characteristics using a loss rate analysis, and a specific reserve analysis for credits individually evaluated. The allowance for credit losses for collectively evaluated portfolios is developed using multiple Moody’s macroeconomic forecasts applied to internally developed credit models for a two year reasonable and supportable period. These forecasts are anchored on a baseline economic forecast, which Moody’s defines as the “most likely outcome” based on current conditions and its view of where the economy is headed. The baseline scenario is positioned at the 50th percentile of possible outcomes. Several upside and downside alternative scenarios are also derived from that baseline scenario and considered when assessing reasonably possible outcomes.

The modest net increase in the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 reflects higher coverage across most portfolios, due to the expected impact of stress related to prolonged elevated interest rates and inflation and other market conditions. In arriving at the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2024, the Company weighted Moody’s December 2024 baseline economic forecast at 
40
% and downside mild recessionary S-2 scenario at 
60
%. The December 2024 baseline scenario maintains a generally optimistic outlook in its assumptions surrounding the drivers of economic growth, with no recession forecasted in the near-term. The S-2 scenario is less optimistic compared to the baseline with a mild recession forecasted starting in the first quarter of 2025 and lasting for three quarters.
The modest decrease in the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 reflected relatively stable economic conditions, outlook and credit quality metrics for the year. In arriving at the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023, the Company weighted the baseline economic forecast at 
40
%, the downside recessionary scenario S-2 at 
60
%. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 reflected improvement in expected economic conditions. In arriving at the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022, the Company weighted the baseline economic forecast at 
25
%, the downside recessionary scenario S-2 at 
75
%.

As a part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loans and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. As described in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, accounting and reporting requirements changed related to such modifications effective January 1, 2023.
Nonaccrual loans include reportable nonaccruing modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty (MEFDs) of $
20.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
0.1
 million, at December 31, 2023. Total reportable MEFDs, both accruing and nonaccruing, were $
99.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
24.5
 million at December 31, 2023. Unfunded commitments to borrowers whose terms have been modified as a reportable MEFD were $
6.9
 million and $
0.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents

The tables below provide detail by portfolio class for reportable MEFDs entered into during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Modified facilities are reported using the balance at the end of each period reported and are reflected only once in each table based on the type of modification or combination of modification.

The Company routinely assesses the ratings of loans in its portfolio through an established and comprehensive portfolio management process. Below are the definitions of the Company’s internally assigned grades:

Commercial:

•
Pass - loans properly approved, documented, collateralized, and performing which do not reflect an abnormal credit risk. 
•
Pass - Watch - credits in this category are of sufficient risk to cause concern. This category is reserved for credits that display negative performance trends. The “Watch” grade should be regarded as a transition category. 

110

Table of Contents

•
Special Mention - a criticized asset category defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the institution’s credit position. Special mention credits are not considered part of the Classified credit categories and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
•
Substandard - an asset that is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
•
Doubtful - an asset that has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
•
Loss - credits classified as Loss are considered uncollectable and are charged off promptly once so classified.
Residential and Consumer:

•
Performing – accruing loans
•
Nonperforming – loans for which there are good reasons to doubt that payments will be made in full. Nonperforming loans include all loans with nonaccrual status.

Note 5. Operating Leases
The Company has operating leases on a number of its branches, certain regional headquarters and other properties to limit its exposure to ownership risks such as fluctuations in real estate prices and obsolescence. The Company leases real estate with lease terms generally from 
five
 to 
20 years
, some of which have renewal options from

one
 to 
20 years
. 
As these extension options are 
not
 generally considered reasonably certain of renewal, they are not included in the lease term
. The Company is not a lessee in any contracts classified as finance leases.

Note 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired or the excess of the fair value of the net liabilities assumed over the consideration received in a business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill was $
855.5
 million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2024 by performing a qualitative (Step Zero) assessment. The qualitative assessment involved the examination of changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors and other relevant entity-specific events, including changes in management and other key personnel and changes in the share price of the Company’s common stock. As a result of the assessment, the Company concluded that its goodwill was not impaired
.
No

goodwill impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the periods benefited and are evaluated for impairment similar to other long-lived assets. The purchase and carrying values of intangible assets subject to amortization at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

The Company invests in certain affordable housing project limited partnerships that are qualified low-income housing tax credit developments. These investments are considered variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary and, therefore, are not consolidated. These partnerships generate low-income tax credits that are earned over a 10-year period, beginning with the year the rental activity begins. The Company has elected to use the practical expedient method of amortization, which approximates the proportional amortization method, whereby the investment cost is amortized in proportion to the allocated tax credits over the 
10 year
 tax credit period. Additionally, the Company recognizes deferred taxes on the basis difference of the tax equity investment to reflect the financial impact of other tax benefits (e.g., tax operating losses) not included in the practical expedient amortization. The tax credits, when realized, are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as a reduction of income tax expense. The Company’s investments in affordable housing limited partnerships totaled $
37.5
 million and $
37.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with a carry balance net of accumulated amortization included in the other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaling $
25.6
 million and $
29.6
 million, respectively, for those same periods. The net impact of the low-income housing tax credit program was not material to our Consolidated Statements of Income or Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Table of Contents

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are funds borrowed on a secured basis by selling securities under agreements to repurchase, mainly in connection with treasury-management services offered to deposit customers. The customer repurchase agreements mature daily and are secured by agency securities. As the Company maintains effective control over assets sold under agreements to repurchase, the securities continue to be presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because the Company acts as a borrower transferring assets to the counterparty, and the agreements mature daily, the Company’s risk is limited.

The $
700
 million of FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2023 consists of 
one
 fixed rate note entered into on December 29, 2023, that matured on January 2, 
2024

, the Company completed the issuance of subordinated notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of $

 million, with a stated maturity of 
June 15, 2060
. The notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 
6.25
% per annum, with quarterly interest payments that began 
September 15, 2020
. Subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve, the Company may redeem the notes in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after 
June 15, 2025
. This debt qualifies as tier 2 capital in the calculation of certain regulatory capital ratios.

All of the Company’s other long-term debt consists of borrowings associated with tax credit fund activities. Although these borrowings have indicated maturities through 
2052
, each is expected to be satisfied at the end of the 
seven-year
 compliance period for the related tax credit investments.

Note 11. Derivatives

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage risks related to differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments. The Bank also enters into interest rate derivative agreements as a service to certain qualifying customers. The Bank manages a matched book with respect to these customer derivatives in order to minimize its net interest rate risk exposure resulting from such agreements. In addition, the Bank also enters into risk participation agreements under which it may either sell or buy credit risk associated with a customer’s performance under certain interest rate derivative contracts related to loans in which participation interests have been sold to or purchased from other banks.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company is party to various interest rate swap agreements designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of the Company’s forecasted variable cash flows for pools of variable rate loans. For each agreement, the Company receives interest at a fixed rate and pays at a variable rate. The Company terminated four and six swap agreements during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and paid cash of approximately $
13.7
 million and $
2.9
 million, respectively, for those same periods. The net cash received/paid for these transactions was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized into earnings through the original maturity dates of the respective contracts. Using the elections allowed for ASU 2022-06 "Reference Rate Return (Topic 848)," as amended, the Company converted all of its LIBOR-based swaps to SOFR and replaced the variable rate loan pools with SOFR based instruments during the second quarter of 2023, with minimal impact to financial results. The notional amounts of the swap agreements in place at December 31, 2024 expire as follows: $
50
 million in 
2025
; $
425
 million in 
2026
, $
825
 million in 
2027
 and $
50
 million thereafter.

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate swaps on securities available for sale

The Company is party to forward-starting fixed payer swaps that convert the latter portion of the term of certain available for sale securities to a floating rate. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk. This strategy provides the Company with a fixed rate coupon during the front-end unhedged tenor of the bonds and results in a floating rate security during the back-end hedged tenor. At December 31, 2024, these single layer instruments have hedge start dates between January 2025 and

119

Table of Contents

July 2026, and maturity dates from December 2027 through March 2031. The fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk is presented in interest income along with the fair value of the hedging instrument.

The hedged available for sale securities are part of closed portfolios of pre-payable commercial mortgage-backed securities. In accordance with ASC 815, prepayment risk may be excluded when measuring the change in fair value of such hedged items attributable to interest rate risk under the portfolio layer method (formerly referred to as last-of-layer). At December 31, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolio of pre-payable commercial mortgage-backed securities totaled $
514.1
 million, excluding any basis adjustment.

The amount that represents the hedged items was $
437.7
 million and the basis adjustment associated with the hedged items was a loss totaling $
39.8
 million.

There were no fair value swap agreements terminated during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company terminated four fair value swap agreements during the year ended December 31, 2023, and received cash of approximately $
19.3
 million. The Company terminated 25 fair value swap agreements during the year ended December 31, 2022, and received cash of approximately $
90.6
 million. At the time of termination, the value of the swaps was recorded as an adjustment to the book value of the underlying security, thereby changing its current book yield and extending its duration, if held, or impacting the net gain or loss, if sold.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges

Customer interest rate derivative program

The Bank enters into interest rate derivative agreements, primarily rate swaps, with commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. The Bank enters into offsetting agreements with unrelated financial institutions, thereby mitigating its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Because the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.

Risk participation agreements

The Bank also enters into risk participation agreements under which it may either assume or sell credit risk associated with a borrower’s performance under certain interest rate derivative contracts. In those instances where the Bank has assumed credit risk, it is not a direct counterparty to the derivative contract with the borrower and has entered into the risk participation agreement because it is a party to the related loan agreement with the borrower. In those instances in which the Bank has sold credit risk, it is the sole counterparty to the derivative contract with the borrower and has entered into the risk participation agreement because other banks participate in the related loan agreement. The Bank manages its credit risk under risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrower, based on the Bank’s normal credit review process.

Mortgage banking derivatives

The Bank also enters into certain derivative agreements as part of its mortgage banking activities. These agreements include interest rate lock commitments on prospective residential mortgage loans and forward commitments to sell loans to investors on either a best efforts or a mandatory delivery basis. The Company uses these forward sales commitments, which may include To Be Announced (TBA) security contracts, on the open market to protect the value of its rate locks and mortgage loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing between the origination of the rate lock and the final sale of these loans. These instruments meet the definition of derivative financial instruments and are reflected in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes to the fair value recorded in noninterest income within the secondary mortgage market operations line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The loans sold on a mandatory basis commit the Company to deliver a specific principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price, by a specified date. If the Company fails to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, we may be obligated to pay a pair-off fee, based on then-current market prices, to the investor/counterparty to compensate the investor for the shortfall. Mandatory delivery forward commitments include TBA security contracts on the open market to provide protection against changes in interest rates on the locked mortgage pipeline. The Company expects that mandatory delivery contracts, including TBA security contracts, will experience changes in fair value opposite to the changes in the fair value of derivative loan commitments. Certain assumptions, including pull through rates and rate lock periods, are used in managing the existing and future hedges. The accuracy of underlying assumptions could impact the ultimate effectiveness of any hedging strategies.
Forward commitments under best effort contracts commit the Company to deliver a specific individual mortgage loan to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. Generally, best efforts cash contracts have no pair-off risk regardless of market movement. The price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded, generally the same day the

120

Table of Contents

Company enters into the interest rate lock commitment with the potential borrower. The Company expects that these best efforts forward loan sale commitments will experience a net neutral shift in fair value with related derivative loan commitments.
At the closing of the loan, the rate lock commitment derivative expires and the Company generally records a loan held for sale at fair value under the election of fair value option.
Customer foreign exchange forward contract derivatives

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward derivative agreements, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, with commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. The Bank manages its risk exposure from such transactions by entering into offsetting agreements with unrelated financial institutions. The Bank has not elected to designate these foreign exchange forward contract derivatives as hedges; as such, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.

Visa Class B derivative contract

The Company is a member of Visa USA. In 2018, the Company sold the majority of its Visa Class B holdings, at which time it entered into a derivative agreement with the purchaser whereby the Company will make or receive cash payments whenever the conversion ratio of the Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is adjusted. The conversion ratio changes when Visa deposits funds to a litigation escrow established by Visa to pay settlements for certain litigation, for which Visa is indemnified by Visa USA members. The Company is also required to make periodic financing payments to the purchaser until all of Visa’s covered litigation matters are resolved. Thus, the derivative contract extends until the end of Visa’s covered litigation matters, the timing of which is uncertain.

During the second quarter of 2024, Visa allowed Class B holders to convert some but not all of their Class B shares to Class A shares. As a result of this conversion event, the Bank and its counterparty agreed to modify the transaction agreement to reflect the partial exchange and include certain provisions related to conversion rate changes. The conversion plan approved by Visa requires a minimum of 12 months before another exchange event and thus extends the expected time for a full resolution of the matter.
The contract includes a contingent accelerated termination clause based on the credit ratings of the Company. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the liability associated with this contract was $
2.1
 million and $
1.3
 million respectively. Refer to Note 20 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments for discussion of the valuation inputs and process for this derivative liability.
LIBOR Transition
Using the elections allowed for ASU 2022-06 "Reference Rate Return (Topic 848)," as amended, and in accordance with the Federal Reserve Bank Board’s Final Rule published pursuant to the authority granted under the LIBOR Act, all of the Company’s remaining derivative instruments with LIBOR based indexes were transitioned to the Fallback Rate SOFR benchmark as recommended by the International Swap and Derivatives Association effective July 1, 2023. Transitioned LIBOR based instruments included interest rate swaps and risk participation agreements with notional amounts totaling $
3.5
 billion and $
163.5
 million, respectively, at July 1, 2023. There was no material financial impact to the Company’s operating results from this transition.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain of the Bank’s derivative instruments contain provisions allowing the financial institution counterparty to terminate the contracts in certain circumstances, such as the downgrade of the Bank’s credit ratings below specified levels, a default by the Bank on its indebtedness, or the failure of the Bank to maintain specified minimum regulatory capital ratios or its regulatory status as a well-capitalized institution. These derivative agreements also contain provisions regarding the posting of collateral by each party. The Company is not in violation of any such provisions. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
39.1
 million and $
65.6
 million, respectively, for which the Company had posted collateral of $
38.0
 million and $
66.0
 million, respectively.

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

The Bank’s derivative instruments with certain counterparties contain legally enforceable netting provisions that allow for net settlement of multiple transactions to a single amount, which may be positive, negative, or zero. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event that the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. For centrally cleared derivatives, the Company is subject to initial margin posting and daily variation margin exchange with the central clearinghouses.
 Offsetting information in regards to all derivative assets and liabilities, including accrued interest subject to these master netting agreements at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is presented in the following tables:

Common shares outstanding excludes treasury shares totaling 
6.7
 million and 
6.3
 million with a first-in-first-out cost basis of $
264.1
 million and $
236.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Shares outstanding also excludes unvested restricted share awards of totaling 
0.1
 million and 
0.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Stock Buyback Programs
On December 9, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program, effective January 1, 2025, whereby the Company is authorized to repurchase up to approximately 
4.3
 million shares of its common stock through the program’s expiration date of December 31, 2026. The program allows the Company to repurchase its common shares in the open market, by block purchase, through accelerated share repurchase programs, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, in one or more transactions. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under this program, and the Board of Directors has the ability to terminate or amend the program at any time prior to the expiration date.

Prior to its expiration on December 31, 2024, the Company had in place a stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on January 26, 2023, whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase up to approximately 
4.3
 million shares of its outstanding common stock. The program allowed the Company to repurchase its common shares in the open market, by block purchase, through accelerated share repurchase programs, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, in one or more transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 
762,993
 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $
49.40
 per share, inclusive of commissions, under this program. 
No
 shares were repurchased under this program in 2023. The Company has accrued $
0.1
 million of estimated excise tax associated with share repurchases during 2024.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income or Loss (AOCI) is reported as a component of stockholders’ equity. AOCI can include, among other items, unrealized holding gains and losses on securities available for sale (AFS), including the Company’s share of unrealized gains and losses reported by a partnership accounted for under the equity method, gains and losses associated with pension or other post-retirement benefits that are not recognized immediately as a component of net periodic benefit cost, and gains and losses on derivative instruments that are designated as, and qualify as, cash flow hedges. Net unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities reclassified as securities held to maturity (HTM) also continue to be reported as a component of AOCI and will be amortized over the estimated remaining life of the securities as an adjustment to interest income. Subject to certain thresholds, unrealized losses on employee benefit plans will be reclassified into income as pension and post-retirement costs are recognized over the remaining service period of plan participants. Accumulated gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate loans described in Note 11 will be reclassified into income over the life of the hedge. Accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the terminated interest rate swaps will be amortized over the remaining maturities of the designated instruments. Gains and losses within AOCI are net of deferred income taxes, where applicable.

Regulatory Capital

Measures of regulatory capital are an important tool used by regulators to monitor the financial health of financial institutions. The primary quantitative measures used to gauge capital adequacy are Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (risk-based capital ratios) and the Tier 1 capital to average total assets (leverage ratio). Both the Company and the Bank subsidiary are required to maintain minimum risk-based capital ratios of 
8.0
% total capital, 
4.5
% Common Equity Tier 1, and 
6.0
% Tier 1 capital. The minimum leverage ratio is 
3.0
% for bank holding companies and banks that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest supervisory rating. All others are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
4.0
%.

To evaluate capital adequacy, regulators compare an institution’s regulatory capital ratios with their agency guidelines, as well as with the guidelines established as part of the uniform regulatory framework for prompt corrective supervisory action toward financial institutions. The framework for prompt corrective action categorizes capital levels into one of five classifications rating from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution to be eligible to be classified as well capitalized its Total risk-based capital ratios must be at least 
10.0
% for total capital, 
6.5
% for Common Equity Tier 1 and 
8.0
% for Tier 1 capital, and its leverage ratio must be at least 
5.0
%. In reaching an overall conclusion on capital adequacy or assigning a classification under the uniform framework, regulators also consider other subjective and quantitative measures of risk associated with an institution. The Company and the Bank were deemed to be well capitalized based upon the most recent notifications from their regulators. There are no conditions or events since those notifications that management believes would change the classifications. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company and the Bank were in compliance with all of their respective minimum regulatory capital requirements.

Following is a summary of the actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank together with corresponding regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company elected the five-year rule that provides a full delay of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital transition (

%) for 2020 and 2021, followed by a three-year transition (
25
% of the impact included in 2022, 
50
% in 2023, 
75
% in 2024 and 
100
% thereafter). The two-year delay included the full impact of day one CECL plus the estimated impact of current CECL activity calculated quarterly as 
25
% 
of the current ACL over the day one balance (“modified transition amount”). The modified transition

amounts 
were recalculated each quarter in 2020 and 2021, with the December 31, 2021 impact of $
24.9
 million, plus the day one impact of $
44.1
 million (net of tax) carrying through the remaining three years of the transition.

Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends

Regulatory policy statements provide that generally, bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings and that the level of dividends must be consistent with current and expected capital requirements. Dividends received from the Bank have been the primary source of funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends to its stockholders. Federal and State banking laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends the Bank may distribute to the Company without prior regulatory approval, as well as the amount of loans it may make to the Company. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to approval by the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance of the State of Mississippi. Further, a capital conservation buffer of 
2.5
% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total risk-based capital) must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends without restrictions.

Reported income tax expense (benefit) differed from amounts computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 
21
% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 to earnings or loss before income taxes. Historically, the primary differences have been due to tax-exempt income, federal and state tax credits and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The main source of tax credits has been investments in tax-advantaged securities and tax credit projects. These investments are made primarily in the markets we serve and directed at tax credits issued under the Federal and State New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) programs, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) programs, as well as pre-2018 Qualified Zone Academy Bonds (QZAB) and Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCB).

The Company had approximately $
58.3
 million in state net operating loss carryforwards that originated in the tax years 
2003 through 2024
 and begin expiring in 
2032
. A $
58.3
 million gross state valuation allowance has been established for all non-bank entity level state net operating loss carryforwards, which translates to a net $
2.6
 million valuation allowance in the Company’s deferred tax inventory. The remainder of the allowance is related to deferred executive compensation. The impact of this valuation allowance is not material to the financial statements.

The tax benefit of a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return should be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on its technical merits. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company does not expect the liability for unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly during 2025. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters in income tax expense, and the amounts recognized during 2024, 2023 and 2022 were insignificant.

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as filing various state returns. 
Generally, the federal returns for years prior to 2021 are no longer subject to examination. State returns that are open to examination vary by jurisdiction and are generally open three to four years
.

Note 15. Earnings Per Share

The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method. The two-class method allocates net income to each class of common stock and participating security according to common dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Participating securities consist of nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
A summary of the information used in the computation of earnings per common share follows.

Potential common shares consist of stock options, nonvested performance-based awards, nonvested restricted stock units, and nonvested restricted share awards deferred under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. These potential common shares do not enter into the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the impact would be antidilutive, i.e., increase earnings per share or reduce a loss per share. The weighted-average of potentially dilutive common shares that were anti-dilutive totaled 
16,338
, 
100,391
 and 
3,116
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common diluted share for the respective periods.

Note 16. Segment Reporting

U.S. GAAP requires that information be reported about a company’s operating segments using a “management approach.” Reportable segments are identified in these standards as those revenue-producing components for which discrete financial information is produced internally and which are subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The Company has identified the Capital Committee as the chief operating decision maker. The Capital Committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Hancock Whitney Bank President and Chief Operating Officer,  Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and General Counsel. Consistent with the Company’s strategy that is focused on providing a consistent package of banking products and services across all markets, the Company has identified its overall banking operations as its only reportable segment.

128

Table of Contents

The Capital Committee primarily uses net income and its components to make operational and financial decisions and manage the Company. Financial reports utilized include actual results compared to budget, forecasts, prior period results, and peer and analyst estimates. The accounting policies used to measure the profit and loss of the segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies found in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements. The significant segment expenses included in net income are presented in the financial statement captions shown on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Income and in Note 13 – Other Noninterest Income and Other Noninterest Expense, and align materially with those reported to the Capital Committee. There are no other segment items that are required to reconcile expenses included in net income to significant expenses reviewed by the Capital Committee.

Note 17. Retirement Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan, the Hancock Whitney Corporation Pension Plan and Trust Agreement (“Pension Plan”), covering certain eligible associates. Eligibility is based on minimum age and service-related requirements. In 2017, the Pension Plan was amended to exclude any individual hired or rehired by the Company after June 30, 2017 from eligibility to participate. The Pension Plan amendment further provided that the accrued benefits of each participant in the Pension Plan whose combined age plus years of service as of January 1, 2018 totaled less than 55 were to be frozen as of January 1, 2018, and not thereafter increase.

The Company makes contributions to this plan in amounts sufficient to meet funding requirements set forth in federal employee benefit and tax laws, plus such additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate. The Company was 
no
t required to make a contribution to the Pension Plan during 2024 or 2023. The Company does not anticipate being required to make a contribution, nor does it anticipate making a discretionary contribution to the Pension Plan in 2025.
The Company also offers a defined contribution retirement benefit plan (401(k) plan), the Hancock Whitney Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan and Trust Agreement (“401(k) Plan”), that covers substantially all associates who have been employed 60 days and meet a minimum age requirement and employment classification criteria. The Company matches 
100
% of the first 
1
% of compensation saved by a participant, and 
50
% of the next 
5
% of compensation saved. Newly eligible associates are automatically enrolled at an initial 
3
% savings rate unless the associate actively opts out of participation in the plan. The 401(k) Plan was also amended during the second quarter of 2017 for participants whose benefits were frozen under the Pension Plan to add an enhanced Company contribution beginning January 1, 2018, in the amount of 
2
%, 
4
% or 
6
% of such participant’s eligible compensation, based on the participant’s age and years of service with the Company. The 401(k) Plan’s amendment further provided that the Company will contribute to the benefit of those associates of the Company hired or rehired after June 30, 2017, and those associates of the Company never enrolled in the Pension Plan an additional basic contribution in an amount equal to 
2
% of the associate’s eligible compensation beginning January 1, 2018. Participants vest in the new basic and enhanced Company contributions upon completion of 
three years
 of service.

The Company’s 401(k) plan matching expense totaled $
17.8
 million, $
17.9
 million and $
17.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Certain associates who were designated executive officers of Whitney Holding Corporation and/or Whitney National Bank before the acquisition by the Company are also covered by an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under this nonqualified plan were designed to supplement amounts to be paid under the defined benefit plan previously maintained for employees of Whitney Holding Corporation and/or Whitney National Bank (the “Whitney Pension Plan”), and are calculated using the Whitney Pension Plan’s formula, but without applying the restrictions imposed on qualified plans by certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accrued benefits under this plan were frozen as of December 31, 2012 in connection with the merger of the Whitney Pension Plan into the Company’s qualified defined benefit pension plan, and no future benefits will be accrued under this plan.

The Company also sponsors defined benefit postretirement plans for certain associates. The Hancock postretirement plans are available only to associates hired by the Company prior to January 1, 2000. The Hancock plans provide health care and life insurance benefits to retiring associates who participate in medical and/or group life insurance benefit plans for active associates and have reached 
55
 years of age with 
ten years
 of service, at the time of retirement. The postretirement health care plan is contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually and subject to certain employer contribution maximums.

The Whitney postretirement plans are available only to former employees of Whitney Holding Corporation and/or Whitney National Bank who meet the eligibility requirements, and offer health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and their eligible dependents. Participant contributions are required under the health plan. These plans restrict eligibility for postretirement health benefits to retirees already receiving benefits as of the date of the plan amendments in 2007 and to those active participants who were eligible to receive benefits as of December 31, 2007 (i.e., were age 55 with 
ten years
 of credited service). Life insurance benefits are currently only available to associates who retired before December 31, 2007.

Table of Contents

The Company assumed certain trends in health care costs in the determination of the benefit obligations. The plans assumed a 
7
% increase in health costs, increasing to 
7.50
% in 2025, declining to 
6.60
% uniformly over a 
three year
 period, and then following the Getzen model thereafter. At December 31, 2024, 
the mortality assumption was based on Revised RP-2014 Employee and Healthy Annuitants Bottom Quartile Fully Generational Mortality Table for Males and Females - Projected with Improvement Scale MP-2021.

The following tables detail the changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets of the defined benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as the funded status of the plans at each year end and the amounts recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.

 million on the defined benefit pension plan, offset by an unfunded benefit obligation of $
11.4
 million for the nonqualified retirement plan.

Net actuarial gain is a significant component of the change in the projected benefit obligation of the Pension Plan for the year ended December 31, 2024. The actuarial gain was primarily driven by a change in the discount rate used in computing the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2024.

The long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the weighted-average of historical real returns for major asset classes based on target asset allocations. For all periods presented, the discount rate for the benefit obligation was calculated by matching expected future cash flows to the USI Consulting Group Pension Discount Curve (AA).

The expected benefit payments are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s benefit obligations at December 31, 2024.

The fair values of pension plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, by asset category, are shown in the following tables. The fair value is presented based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs into the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, Level 2 uses significant observable inputs, and Level 3 uses significant unobservable inputs. In accordance with Subtopic 820-10 common trust funds are reported at fair value using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

131

Table of Contents

For all investments, the plan attempts to use quoted market prices of identical assets on active exchanges, or Level 1 measurements. Where such quoted market prices are not available, the plan will use quoted prices for similar instruments or discounted cash flows to estimate the value, reported as Level 2.

Plan assets are invested in long-term strategies and evaluated within the context of a long-term investment horizon. Plan assets will be diversified across multiple asset classes so as to minimize the risk of large losses. Short-term fluctuations in value will be considered secondary to long-term results. The Company employs a total return approach whereby a diversified mix of asset class investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for an acceptable level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and the Company’s financial condition. The investment performance of the plan is regularly monitored to ensure that appropriate risk levels are being taken and to evaluate returns versus a suitable market benchmark. The benefits investment committee meets periodically to review the policy, strategy, and performance of the plans.

Note 18. Share-Based Payment Arrangements

The Company maintains incentive compensation plans that incorporate share-based payment arrangements for associates and directors. The current plan under which share-based awards may be granted, the 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”), was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the 2020 annual meeting as a successor to the Company’s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). Certain share-based awards remain outstanding under the 2014 Plan and prior equity incentive compensation plans, but no future awards may be granted thereunder.

The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors administers the equity incentive plans, makes determinations with respect to participation by employees or directors and authorizes the share-based awards. Under the 2020 Plan, participants may be awarded stock options (including incentive stock options for associates), restricted shares, performance stock awards and stock appreciation rights, all on a stand-alone, combination or tandem basis. To date, the Committee has awarded stock options, tenure-based restricted share awards and units, and performance stock units under the 2020 Plan and the prior equity incentive plans.

Under the 2020 Plan, future awards may be granted for the issuance of an aggregate of 
3,900,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock, plus a number of additional shares of the Company’s common stock (not to exceed 
1,000,000
) for which awards under the 2014 Plan are cancelled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued, or settled in cash. The 2020 Plan limits the number of shares for which awards may be granted to any participant during any calendar year to 
250,000
 shares. The Company may use authorized unissued shares or shares held in treasury to satisfy awards under the 2020 Plan.

As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 
1.4
 million

shares available for future issuance under the 2020 equity compensation plan.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total share-based compensation expense recognized in income was $
22.7
 million, $
24.7
 million and $
23.5
 million, respectively. The total recognized tax benefit related to the share-based compensation was $
6.3
 million, $
5.7
 million and $
7.0
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

A summary of the Company’s nonvested restricted and performance shares for the year ended December 31, 2024 is presented below:

At December 31, 2024, there was $
44.4
 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted and performance share awards and units expected to vest in the future. This compensation is expected to be recognized in expense over a weighted-average period of

3.0
 years. The fair value of shares that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled $
24.0
 million and $
18.4
 million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company granted 
550,976
 restricted stock units (RSUs) to certain eligible employees. The holders of unvested restricted stock units have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including voting or dividend rights. The Company has elected to award dividend equivalents on each restricted stock unit not deferred under the Company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Such dividend equivalents are forfeited should the employee terminate employment prior to the vesting of the RSU.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company granted 
47,734
 performance share awards subject to a total shareholder return (TSR) performance metric with a grant date fair value of $
43.23
 per share and 
47,734
 performance 
share awards subject to an

133

Table of Contents

adjusted 
earnings per share performance metric with a grant date fair value of $
36.25
 per share to key members of executive management. The number of performance shares subject to TSR that ultimately vest at the end of the 
three-year
 performance period, if any, will be based on the relative rank of the Company’s 
three-year
 TSR among the TSRs of a peer group of 
50
 regional banks. The fair value of the performance shares subject to TSR at the grant date was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation method. The number of performance shares subject to adjusted earnings per share that ultimately vest will be based on the Company’s attainment of certain adjusted earnings per share goals over the
 two-year
 performance period. The maximum number of performance shares that could vest is 
200
% of the target award. Compensation expense for these performance shares is recognized on a straight line basis over the 
three-year
 service period.

Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies

Credit Related

In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into financial instruments, such as commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of its customers. Such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded, although they expose the Bank to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans. Under regulatory capital guidelines, the Company and Bank must include unfunded commitments meeting certain criteria in risk-weighted capital calculations.
Commitments to extend credit include revolving commercial credit lines, nonrevolving loan commitments issued mainly to finance the acquisition and development or construction of real property or equipment, and credit card and personal credit lines. The availability of funds under commercial credit lines and loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and other contractual conditions. Loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower’s credit quality deteriorates. A number of commercial and personal credit lines are used only partially or, in some cases, not at all before they expire, and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company.

A substantial majority of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the Bank to fulfill a customer’s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform. The Bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers’ other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors of essential goods and services.

The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company undertakes the same credit evaluation in making loan commitments and assuming conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a reserve for unfunded lending commitments totaling $
24.1
 million and $
28.9
 million, respectively.

The following table presents a summary of the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Legal Proceedings

The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that loss contingencies, if any, arising from pending litigation and regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Special Assessment
In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special deposit insurance assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) arising from the full protection of uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception following the receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the spring of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a pre-tax special assessment expense totaling $
26.1
 million based on the November 2023 final rule. In 2024, the FDIC provided several notices with updated estimates of losses attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors, extending the collection period by quarters and necessitating less material adjustments to the expense in the current year.

134

Table of Contents

The loss estimates resulting from the failures of these institutions are subject to further change pending the projected and actual outcome of loss share agreements, joint ventures, and outstanding litigation. The exact amount of losses incurred will not be determined until the FDIC terminates the receiverships of these banks; therefore, the Company’s exact exposure for FDIC special assessment remains unknown.

Note 20. Fair Value Measurements
The FASB defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The FASB’s guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to these valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving preference to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs such as a reporting entity’s own data (level 3). Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, observable inputs other than quoted prices, such as interest rates and yield curves, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis

The following tables present, for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Table of Contents

Securities classified as level 2 include obligations of U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, including  U.S. Treasury securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations that are issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, and state and municipal bonds. The level 2 fair value measurements for investment securities are obtained quarterly from a third-party pricing service that uses industry-standard pricing models. Substantially all of the model inputs are observable in the marketplace or can be supported by observable data. The Company invests only in securities of investment grade quality with a targeted duration, for the overall portfolio, generally between 
two
 and 
five and a half years
. Company policies generally limit U.S. investments to agency securities and municipal securities determined to be investment grade according to an internally generated score which generally includes a rating of not less than “Baa” or its equivalent by a nationally recognized statistical rating agency.

Loans held for sale consist of residential mortgage loans carried under the fair value option. The fair value for these instruments is classified as level 2 based on market prices obtained from potential buyers.

For the Company’s derivative financial instruments designated as hedges and those under the customer interest rate program, the fair value is obtained from a third-party pricing service that uses an industry-standard discounted cash flow model that relies on inputs, Overnight Index swap rate curves, and SOFR swap curves (where applicable); all observable in the marketplace. To comply with the accounting guidance, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated in the fair values to appropriately reflect nonperformance risk for both the Company and the counterparties. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value these derivative instruments fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit value adjustments utilize level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads. The Company has determined that the impact of the credit valuation adjustments is not significant to the overall valuation of these derivatives. As a result, the Company has classified its derivative valuations for these instruments in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s policy is to measure counterparty credit risk quarterly for derivative instruments, which are all subject to master netting arrangements consistent with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.

The Company also has certain derivative instruments associated with the Bank’s mortgage-banking activities. These derivative instruments include interest rate lock commitments on prospective residential mortgage loans and forward commitments to sell these loans to investors on a best efforts delivery basis and To Be Announced securities for mandatory delivery contracts. The fair value of these derivative instruments is measured using observable market prices for similar instruments and is classified as a level 2 measurement.

The Company’s Level 3 liability consists of a derivative contract with the purchaser of 
192,163
 shares of Visa Class B common stock. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Class A common stock, such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and the Company will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The agreement also requires periodic payments by the Company to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares at the time of sale and a fixed rate of interest that steps up once after the eighth scheduled quarterly payment. The fair value of the liability is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are the Company’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. Refer to Note 11 – Derivatives for information about the derivative contract with the counterparty.

The Company believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements and Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements

The table below presents a rollforward of the amounts on the consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 for financial instruments of a material nature that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Fair Value of Assets Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Collateral-dependent loans individually evaluated for credit loss loans are measured at the fair value of the underlying collateral based on independent third-party appraisals that take into consideration market-based information such as recent sales activity for similar assets in the property’s market.

Other real estate owned and foreclosed assets, including both foreclosed property and surplus banking property, are adjusted to fair value, less estimated selling costs, upon transfer from loans or property and equipment. Subsequently, other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. Fair values are determined by sales agreement or third-party appraisals as discounted for estimated selling costs, information from comparable sales, and marketability of the assets.

The fair value information presented below is not as of the period end, rather it was as of the date the fair value adjustment was recorded during the twelve months for each of the dates presented below, and excludes nonrecurring fair value measurements of assets no longer on the balance sheet.

Table of Contents

Accounting guidance from the FASB requires the disclosure of estimated fair value information about certain on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments, including those financial instruments that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. The significant methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are discussed below.

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Federal Funds Sold
 – For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Securities
 – The fair value measurement for securities available for sale is discussed earlier in this note. The same measurement techniques were applied to the valuation of securities held to maturity.

Loans, Net
 – The fair value measurement for certain collateral dependent loans that are individually evaluated for credit loss was described earlier in this note. For the remaining portfolio, fair values were generally determined by discounting scheduled cash flows using discount rates determined with reference to current market rates at which loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality.

Loans Held For Sale
 – These loans are either carried under the fair value option or at the lower of cost or market. Given the short duration of these instruments, the carrying amount is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Deposits
 – The accounting guidance requires that the fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, be assigned fair values equal to amounts payable upon demand (carrying amounts). The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase
– For these short-term liabilities, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Short-Term FHLB Borrowings 
– There were no FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2024. FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2023 consisted of short-term fixed rate borrowings (five calendar days outstanding); as such, the carrying amount of the instrument is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Long-Term Debt
 – The fair value is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using current market rates at which debt with similar terms could be obtained.

Derivative Financial Instruments
 – The fair value measurement for derivative financial instruments is described earlier in this note.

The following tables present the estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments by fair value hierarchy levels and the corresponding carrying amounts.

ITEM 9A.     CONTR
OLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The rules refer to our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s management, with the participation of its principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework set forth in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management also conducted an assessment of requirements pertaining to Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. This section relates to management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form Y-9C) and compliance with specific laws and regulations. Our evaluation included a review of the documentation of controls, evaluations of the design of the internal control system and tests of the effectiveness of internal controls.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is also included in Item 8.

Based on the foregoing evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
