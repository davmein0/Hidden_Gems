FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning and protections of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make in this annual report are set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC and include, but are not limited to, the following:

•
general economic and business conditions in our local markets, including conditions affecting employment levels, interest rates, inflation, the threat of recession, volatile equity capital markets, property and casualty insurance costs, collateral values, customer income, creditworthiness and confidence, spending and savings that may affect customer bankruptcies, defaults, charge-offs and deposit activity; and the impact of the foregoing on client behavior (including the velocity and levels of deposit withdrawals and loan repayment); 

•
adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures and the potential impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity and regulatory responses to these developments (including increases in the cost of our deposit insurance assessments), the Company's ability to effectively manage its liquidity risk and any growth plans, and the availability of capital and funding;

•
balance sheet and revenue growth expectations may differ from actual results; 

•
the risk that our provision for credit losses may be inadequate or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposure; 

•
loan growth expectations; 

•
management’s predictions about charge-offs; 

•
fluctuations in commercial and residential real estate values, especially as they relate to the value of collateral supporting the Company’s loans;

•
the risk that our enterprise risk management framework may not identify or address risks adequately, which may result in unexpected losses; 

•
the impact of future business combinations, including the pending acquisition of Sabal Trust Company, upon our performance and financial condition including our ability to successfully integrate the businesses; 

•
deposit trends, including growth, pricing and betas; 

•
credit quality trends; 

•
changes in interest rates, including actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board and the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our financial projections, models and guidance; 

•
net interest margin trends, including the impact of changes in interest rates;

•
changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit and credit markets;

•
success of revenue-generating and cost-reducing initiatives;

•
future expense levels; 

•
changes in expense to revenue (efficiency ratio), including the risk that we may not realize and/or sustain benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives or that we may not be able to realize cost savings or revenue benefits in the time period expected, which could negatively affect our future profitability;

•
the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to manage risks; 

•
risks related to our reliance on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the risks related to disruptions in services or financial difficulties of a third-party vendor;

•
risks related to potential claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation, regulatory proceedings or enforcement actions;

•
risks related to the ability of our operational framework to manage risks associated with our business such as credit risk and operation risk, including third-party vendors and other service providers, which could among other things, result in a material breach of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber-attack or similar acts;

•
the extensive use, reliability, disruption, and accuracy of the models and data upon which we rely;

•
risks related to our implementation of new lines of business, new products and services, new technologies, and expansion of our existing business opportunities;

•
projected tax rates; 

•
future profitability;

•
purchase accounting impacts, such as accretion levels; 

•
our ability to identify and address potential cybersecurity risks, which may be exacerbated by recent developments in generative artificial intelligence, on our systems and/or third-party vendors and service providers on which we rely, a material failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our reputation;

•
our ability to receive dividends from Hancock Whitney Bank could affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends or take other capital actions; 

•
the risk that we may be required to make substantial expenditures to keep pace with regulatory initiatives and the rapid technology changes in the financial services market;

•
the impact on our financial results, reputation, and business if we are unable to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations or other supervisory actions or directives and any necessary capital initiatives; 

•
our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional financial services companies, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory standards;

•
the financial impact of future tax legislation; 

•
the effects of war or other conflicts, acts of terrorism, climate change, natural disasters such as hurricanes, freezes, flooding, man-made disasters, such as oil spills, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics, or other catastrophic events that may affect general economic conditions, and/or increase costs, including, but not limited to, property and casualty and other insurance costs;

•
uncertainties surrounding geopolitical events, trade policy, taxation policy, and monetary policy which continue to impact the outlook for future economic growth. The potential U.S. imposition of tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China and consideration of responsive actions by these nations or the expansion of import fees and tariffs among a larger group of nations is bringing greater ambiguity to the outlook for future economic growth;

•
risks related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and environmental, social and governance legislation, rulemaking, activism and litigation, the scope and pace of which could alter our reputation and shareholder, associate, customer and third-party affiliations;

•
changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including governmental monetary and fiscal policies, legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from bank failures, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses;

•
the potential implementation of a regulatory reform agenda under the new presidential administration that is significantly different than that of the prior administration, impacting rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities of the federal banking agencies; and

•
the risk that the regulatory environment may not be conducive to or may prohibit the consummation of future mergers and/or business combinations, may increase the length of time and amount of resources required to consummate such transactions, and the potential to reduce anticipated benefits from such mergers or combinations.

Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “forecast,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “focus,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.” Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in the Company’s forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those risk factors outlined in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of differences in actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such statements, except as required by law.
