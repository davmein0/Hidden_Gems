Market information for Common Stock

Our common shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “PLMR” on April 17, 2019. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common shares. As of February 22, 2025, there were approximately six holders of record of our common stock. Because most of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of our stockholders, this number is not representative of our total stockholders.

 ​

Payment of Dividends

 ​

The continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial capital. We do not intend to declare and pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Because we are a holding company with no business operations of our own, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders largely depends on dividends and other distributions from our U.S. subsidiaries, PESIC and PSIC, and our Bermuda subsidiary, PSRE. State insurance laws, including the laws of Arizona, Oregon and California, and the laws of Bermuda restrict the ability these subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus and restrict dividend payments. Dividend payments are further limited to that part of available policyholder surplus that is derived from net profits on our business. State insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent the reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends up to the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted. Moreover, state insurance regulators may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect.

Our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary is highly regulated and is required to comply with various conditions before it is able to pay dividends or make distributions to us. Bermuda law, including the Insurance Act 1978, as amended (“Insurance Act”) and the Companies Act 1981, as amended (“Companies Act”) impose restrictions on our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to us based on solvency margins and surplus and capital requirements. These restrictions, and any other future restrictions adopted by the BMA, could have the effect, under certain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary without affirmative approval of the BMA.

      52

Table of Contents

Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking immediate cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

In January 2022, Company's the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which replaced the existing program and authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of outstanding shares of common stock.  This program ended on March 31, 2024 and there were no share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2024.

 sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for factors and uncertainties that may cause our actual future results to be materially different from those in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. 

Overview

We are a specialty insurance company that provides property and casualty insurance products to individuals and businesses. We use our underwriting and analytical expertise to provide innovative insurance products serving five categories: Earthquake, Inland Marine and Other Property, Casualty, Fronting, and Crop. We use proprietary data analytics and a modern technology platform to offer our customers flexible products with customized and granular pricing for both the admitted and excess and surplus lines (“E&S”) markets. Our insurance company subsidiaries, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company (“PSIC”) and Palomar Excess and Surplus Insurance Company (“PESIC”) carry an “A” rating from A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), a leading rating agency for the insurance industry.

      54

Table of Contents

We distribute our products through multiple channels, including retail agents, program administrators, wholesale brokers, and partnerships with other insurance companies. Our business strategy is supported by a comprehensive risk transfer program with reinsurance coverage that we believe reduces earnings volatility and provides appropriate levels of protection from catastrophic events. Our management team combines decades of insurance industry experience across specialty underwriting, reinsurance, program administration, distribution, and analytics.

Founded in 2014, we have significantly grown our business and have generated attractive returns. We have organically increased gross written premiums from $16.6 million in our first year of operations to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of approximately 57%. We have also been profitable since 2016 and our net income growth since 2016 reflects a compound annual growth rate of 43%.

We seek to continuously grow our income by developing products in lines of business that harness our core competencies and where we believe we can generate attractive risk adjusted returns. In recent years, we have introduced several new products including Crop, Environmental Liability, and E&S Casualty. In January 2025, we completed the acquisition of First Indemnity of America ("FIA"), a New Jersey domiciled insurance carrier specializing in surety bonds for small to medium sized contractors primarily in the Northeast United States. These new products diversify our book of business and broaden our product portfolio. We believe that our market opportunity, distinctive products, and differentiated business model position us to grow our business profitably.

Components of Our Results of Operations

Gross Written Premiums

Gross written premiums are the amounts received or to be received for insurance policies written or assumed by us during a specific period of time without reduction for policy acquisition costs, reinsurance costs or other deductions. The volume of our gross written premiums in any given period is generally influenced by:

●

Volume of new business submissions in existing products or partnerships;

●

Binding of new business submissions in existing products or partnerships into policies;

●

Entrance into new partnerships or the offering of new types of insurance products;

●

Exits from existing partnerships or reducing or ceasing to offer existing insurance products;

●

Renewal rates of existing policies; and

●

Average size and premium rate of bound policies.

Our gross written premiums are also impacted when we assume unearned in-force premiums due to new partnerships or other business reasons. In periods where we assume a large volume of unearned premiums, our gross written premiums may increase significantly compared to prior periods and the increase may not be indicative of future trends. The majority of our Crop written premiums are recognized in the third quarter, as we receive the requisite reporting from insureds at that time.

Ceded Written Premiums

Ceded written premiums are the amount of gross written premiums ceded to reinsurers. We enter into reinsurance contracts to limit our exposure to potential losses and to provide additional capacity for growth. We cede premiums through excess of loss (“XOL”) agreements, quota share agreements, and fronting agreements. Ceded written premiums are earned pro-rata over the period of risk covered. The volume of our ceded written premiums is impacted by the amount of our gross written premiums and our decisions to increase or decrease limits or retention levels in our XOL agreements and co-participation levels in our quota share agreements. The volume of ceded written premiums is also impacted by the amount of premium we write under fronting agreements.

      55

Table of Contents

Our ceded written premiums can be impacted significantly in certain periods due to changes in quota share agreements. In periods where we modify a quota share agreement, ceded written premiums may increase or decrease significantly compared to prior periods and these fluctuations may not be indicative of future trends. Our XOL costs as a percentage of gross earned premiums also may vary each period due to changes of premium in-force during the XOL contract period or due to acceleration of XOL charges or the need to purchase additional reinsurance due to losses. In addition, the volume of premiums ceded in fronting agreements each period may vary due to the timing of entering new fronting partnerships and terminations of fronting partnerships.

Net Earned Premiums

Net earned premiums represent the earned portion of our gross written premiums, less the earned portion that is ceded to third-party reinsurers under our reinsurance agreements. The majority of our insurance policies have a term of one year and premiums are earned pro rata over the terms of the policies. Crop premiums are earned ratably over the risk period. The requisite reporting of Crop premiums is primarily received in the third quarter, after the start of the risk period, and earned premium is caught up to cover the period between the start of the risk period and receipt of reporting. Generally, this process results in most of the Crop earned premiums being recognized in the third quarter of each year.

Commission and Other Income

Commission and other income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned in conjunction with underwriting policies. Commission and other income are earned on the effective date of the underlying policy.

Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the costs incurred for losses, net of any losses ceded to reinsurers. These expenses are a function of the size and term of the insurance policies we write and the loss experience associated with the underlying coverage. Certain policies we write subject us to attritional losses such as building fires or casualty claims. In addition, many of the policies we write subject us to catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses are certain losses resulting from events involving multiple claims and policyholders, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, convective storms, terrorist acts or other aggregating events. Our losses and loss adjustment expenses are generally affected by:

●

The occurrence, frequency and severity of catastrophe events in the areas where we underwrite policies relating to these perils;

●

The occurrence, frequency and severity of non-catastrophe attritional losses;

●

The mix of business written by us;

●

The reinsurance agreements we have in place at the time of a loss;

●

The geographic location and characteristics of the policies we underwrite;

●

Changes in the legal or regulatory environment related to the business we write;

●

Trends in legal defense costs;

●

Inflation in housing and construction costs; and

●

Increases in amounts awarded by courts and juries.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods. Losses and loss adjustment expenses may be paid out over multiple years.

Acquisition Expenses

Acquisition expenses are principally comprised of the commissions we pay retail agents, program administrators and wholesale brokers, net of ceding commissions and fronting fees we receive on business ceded under quota share and fronting reinsurance agreements. In addition, acquisition expenses include premium-related taxes and other fees. Acquisition expenses related to each policy we write are deferred and expensed pro rata over the term of the policy. We earn fronting fees in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premiums on the underlying insurance policies, on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies.

      56

Table of Contents

Other Underwriting Expenses

Other underwriting expenses represent the general and administrative expenses of our insurance operations including employee salaries and benefits, software and technology costs, office rent, stock-based compensation, licenses and fees, and professional services fees such as legal, accounting, and actuarial services.

Interest Expense

Interest expense consists of the unused line fee, amortization of the commitment fee and interest incurred on borrowings from our credit agreement with U.S. Bank National Association and interest incurred on borrowings from our FHLB line of credit.

Net Investment Income

We earn investment income on our portfolio of invested assets. We invest primarily in investment grade fixed maturity securities, including U.S. government issues, state government issues, mortgage and asset-backed obligations, and corporate bonds with a small portion of our portfolio in equity securities, equity method investments, limited partnerships, and cash and cash equivalents. The principal factors that influence net investment income are the size of our investment portfolio, the yield on that portfolio, and investment management expenses. As measured by amortized cost, which excludes fair value fluctuations from changes in interest rates or other factors, the size of our investment portfolio is mainly a function of our invested capital along with premiums we receive from our insureds, less payments on policyholder claims and other operating expenses. Our balance of invested capital may be impacted in the future by repurchases of shares of our common stock or borrowings under our credit agreements.

Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments are a function of the difference between the amount received by us on the sale of a security and the security’s cost-basis, mark-to-market adjustments, credit losses recognized in earnings, unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on equity method and other investments. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and do not impact our net income.

Income Tax Expense

Currently our income tax expense consists mainly of federal income taxes imposed on our operations. Our effective tax rates are dependent upon the components of pretax earnings and the related tax effects.

Key Financial and Operating Metrics

We discuss certain key financial and operating metrics, described below, which provide useful information about our business and the operational factors underlying our financial performance.

Underwriting revenue
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total revenue, excluding net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of total revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP to underwriting revenue.

Underwriting income
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as income before income taxes excluding net investment income, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and interest expense. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of income before income taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP to underwriting income.

Adjusted net income
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook, net of tax impact. We calculate the tax impact only on adjustments which would be included in calculating our income tax expense using the estimated tax rate at which the company received a deduction for these adjustments. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of net income calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted net income.

Annualized return on equity
 is net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders’ equity during the period.

Annualized adjusted return on equity
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as adjusted net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders’ equity during the period. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of return on equity calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers to adjusted return on equity.

Loss ratio
, expressed as a percentage, is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses, to net earned premiums.

Expense ratio,
 expressed as a percentage, is the ratio of acquisition and other underwriting expenses, net of commission and other income to net earned premiums.

Combined ratio
 is defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.

Adjusted combined ratio
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio calculated excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of combined ratio calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers to adjusted combined ratio.

Diluted adjusted earnings per share
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period, reflecting the dilution which could occur if equity-based awards are converted into common share equivalents as calculated using the treasury stock method. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to diluted adjusted earnings per share.

Catastrophe loss ratio
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as the ratio of catastrophe losses to net earned premiums. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of loss ratio calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers to catastrophe loss ratio.

      58

Table of Contents

Adjusted combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as adjusted combined ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe losses. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of combined ratio calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers to adjusted combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses.

Adjusted underwriting income 
is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as underwriting income excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of income before income taxes calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted underwriting income.

Tangible stockholders
’
 equity
 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as stockholders’ equity less intangible assets. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of stockholders’ equity calculated in accordance with GAAP to tangible stockholders’ equity.

Gross Written Premiums

Gross written premiums were $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $400.4 million, or 35.1%. Premium growth was primarily due to an increased volume of policies written across our lines of business which was driven by new business generated with existing partners, strong premium retention rates for existing business, expansion of our distribution footprint, and new partnerships.

(1) - Beginning in 2024, the Company has updated the categorization of its products to align with management's current strategy and view of the business. Prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparability purposes. The recategorization is for presentation purposes only and does not impact overall gross written premiums.

Fronting premiums represent premium where we subsequently cede the majority of the premium and risk in exchange for a fronting fee, which is our primary source of profit in the arrangement. The volume of fronting premiums written each period may vary due to the timing of entering new fronting partnerships and terminations of existing fronting partnerships. A large fronting partnership terminated in the third quarter of 2024, causing the decline in fronting premiums shown above.

The year ended December 31, 2024 was our first full year of offering Crop products, which led to the growth shown above. Crop premiums are primarily written and earned during the third quarter of each year.

Ceded Written Premiums

Ceded written premiums increased $165.6 million, or 22.6%, to $897.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $731.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased premiums ceded related to our Crop products as these products saw significant growth and we currently cede the majority of Crop premiums and risk to reinsurers. In addition, our XOL reinsurance expense increased due to growth in exposure and higher rates on XOL reinsurance.

Although our volume of ceded written premiums increased, ceded written premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased to 58.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 64.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023. This percentage decrease was driven by changes in our composition of business whereby premiums written in the current year were subject to lower quota share or XOL cession percentages compared to premiums written in the prior year.

Net Written Premiums

Net written premiums increased $234.8 million, or 57.3%, to $644.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $410.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in gross written premiums, primarily in our Casualty and Earthquake products, partially offset by increased ceded written premiums.

Our net earned premium ratio increased due to changes in our composition of business whereby premiums earned in the current period were subject to lower quota share or XOL cession percentages compared to premiums earned in the prior period.

Commission and Other Income

Commission and other income decreased $0.6 million, or 17.3%, to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in policy related fees driven by changes in the mix of business produced.

Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $62.2 million, or 85.6%, to $134.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Catastrophe losses increased during the year ended December 31, 2024 due to higher frequency and severity of catastrophe events compared to the prior year. Catastrophe losses during the year ended December 31, 2024 were related to floods occurring during the first quarter, severe convective storms occurring during the second quarter, and Hurricanes Beryl, Debby, Helene and Milton which occurred during the third and fourth quarters. Catastrophe losses during the year ended December 31, 2023 were primarily related to floods occurring during the first quarter and severe convective storms occurring during the second quarter. 

Non-catastrophe attritional losses increased due to a higher volume of premiums being subject to attritional losses, primarily driven by the growth in Casualty and Inland Marine and other Property premiums.

Acquisition Expenses

Acquisition expenses increased $41.9 million, or 38.9%, to $149.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher commission expenses driven by higher gross earned premiums. This was partially offset by higher ceding commissions due to a higher volume of premiums subject to quota share arrangements.

Acquisition expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums were 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 10.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Acquisition expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums slightly increased due to the higher commission expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums due to changes in mix of business produced.

Other Underwriting Expenses

Other underwriting expenses increased $28.9 million, or 32.8%, to $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Company incurring higher payroll, technology, and stock-based compensation expenses associated with growth of the Company.

Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums were 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding the impact of expenses relating to transactions, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and catastrophe bonds, other underwriting expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums were 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023. This percentage was relatively consistent as adjusted operating expenses grew at approximately the same rate as gross earned premiums. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of gross earned premiums may fluctuate period over period based on timing of certain expenses relative to premium growth.

Net Investment Income and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments

Net investment income increased $12.1 million, or 51.1%, to $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a higher average balance of investments during the year ended December 31, 2024 and higher yields on invested assets.

The Company incurred $4.6 million of net realized and unrealized gains on investments for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $2.9 million of net realized and unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2023. In both periods, the balance was primarily driven by unrealized gains on our equity securities due to the general performance of equity security markets. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and do not impact our net income.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Underwriting Revenue

We define underwriting revenue as total revenue excluding net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments. Underwriting revenue represents revenue generated by our underwriting operations and allows us to evaluate our underwriting performance without regard to investment income. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Underwriting revenue should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting revenue differently.

Underwriting Income and adjusted underwriting income

We define underwriting income as income before income taxes excluding net investment income, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, and interest expense. Underwriting income represents the pre-tax profitability of our underwriting operations and allows us to evaluate our underwriting performance without regard to investment income. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for pre-tax income calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting income differently.

We define adjusted underwriting income as underwriting income excluding the impact of certain items that may not be indicative of underlying business trends, operating results, or future outlook. We use this metric as we believe it gives our management and other users of our financial information useful insight into our underlying business performance. Adjusted underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for pre-tax income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may define adjusted underwriting income differently.

We calculate the tax impact only on adjustments which would be included in calculating our income tax expense using the estimated tax rate at which the company received a deduction for these adjustments. We use adjusted net income as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives our management and financial statement users useful insight into our results of operations and our underlying business performance. Adjusted net income does not reflect the overall profitably of our business and should not be viewed as a substitute for net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may define adjusted net income differently.

Catastrophe Loss Ratio 

 ​

Catastrophe loss ratio is defined as the ratio of catastrophe losses to net earned premiums. Although we are inherently subject to catastrophe losses, the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses is unpredictable and their impact on our operating results may vary significantly between periods and obscure other trends in our business. Therefore, we are providing this metric because we believe it gives our management and other financial statement users useful insight into our results of operations and trends in our financial performance without the volatility caused by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe loss ratio should not be viewed as a substitute for loss ratio calculated using unadjusted GAAP numbers, and other companies may define catastrophe loss ratio differently.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Funds

We operate as a holding company with no business operations of our own. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and pay taxes and administrative expenses is largely dependent on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries and affiliates, whose ability to pay us is highly regulated.

The Company’s U.S. insurance company subsidiaries, PSIC and PESIC are restricted by the statutes as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without prior approval by state insurance commissioners.

Under California and Oregon statute which govern PSIC, dividends paid in a consecutive twelve month period cannot exceed the greater of (i) 10% of an insurance company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) 100% of its statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. Any dividends or distributions in excess of these amounts would require regulatory approval. In addition, under Oregon statute PSIC may only declare a dividend from earned surplus, which does not include contributed capital. Surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets is not considered part of earned surplus. Based on the above restrictions, PSIC may pay a dividend or distribution of no greater than $99.6 million in 2025 without approval by the California and Oregon Insurance Commissioners. During October 2024, PSIC elected to pay a dividend of $95.0 million to its parent company.

      69

Table of Contents

Under Arizona statute which governs PESIC, dividends paid in a consecutive twelve month period cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 10% of an insurance company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) 100% of its statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. Based on the above restrictions, PESIC may pay a dividend or distribution of no greater than $4.2 million in 2025 without approval of the Arizona Insurance Commissioner.

In addition to the above limitations, any dividend or distribution declared is also subject to state regulatory approval prior to payment. In the future, state insurance regulatory authorities may adopt statutory provisions and dividend limitations more restrictive than those currently in effect.

Insurance companies in the United States are also required by state law to maintain a minimum level of policyholder’s surplus. State insurance regulators have a risk-based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of the insurer’s assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premium. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total adjusted capital of PSIC and PESIC were in excess of their respective prescribed risk-based capital requirements.

Under the Insurance Act and related regulations, our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary, PSRE, is required to maintain certain solvency and liquidity levels, which it maintained as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

PSRE maintains a Class 3A license and thus must maintain a minimum liquidity ratio in which the value of its relevant assets is not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities for general business. Relevant assets include cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturity securities, accrued interest income, premiums receivable, losses recoverable from reinsurers, and funds withheld. The relevant liabilities include total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities, less sundry liabilities. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we met the minimum liquidity ratio requirement.

Bermuda regulations limit the amount of dividends and return of capital paid by a regulated entity. A Class 3A insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin, its enhanced capital requirement, or its minimum liquidity ratio, or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. If a Class 3A insurer has failed to meet its minimum solvency margin on the last day of any financial year, it will also be prohibited, without the approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”), from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year. Furthermore, the Insurance Act limits the ability of PSRE to pay dividends or make capital distributions by stipulating certain margin and solvency requirements and by requiring approval from the BMA prior to a reduction of 15% or more of a Class 3A insurer’s total statutory capital as reported on its prior year statutory balance sheet. Moreover, an insurer must submit an affidavit to the BMA, sworn by at least two directors and the principal representative in Bermuda of the Class 3A insurer, at least seven days prior to payment of any dividend which would exceed 25% of that insurer’s total statutory capital and surplus as reported on its prior year statutory balance sheet. The affidavit must state that in the opinion of those swearing the declaration of such dividend has not caused the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins.

Further, under the Companies Act, PSRE may only declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that: (1) it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or (2) the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities.

Pursuant to Bermuda regulations, the maximum amount of dividends and return of capital available to be paid by a reinsurer is determined pursuant to a formula. Under this formula, the maximum amount of dividends and return of capital available from PSRE during 2025 is calculated to be approximately $4.2 million. However, this dividend amount is subject to annual enhanced solvency requirement calculations. There were no dividends declared or paid during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023

One of our insurance company subsidiaries, PSIC, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Membership allows PSIC access to collateralized advances, which may be used to support and enhance liquidity management. The amount of advances that may be taken is dependent on statutory admitted assets.

 ​

Cash Flows

Our primary sources of cash flow are written premiums, investment income, reinsurance recoveries, sales and redemptions of investments, and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities. We use our cash flows primarily to pay reinsurance premiums, operating expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses, and income taxes.

Our cash flows from operations may differ substantially from our net income due to non-cash charges or due to changes in balance sheet accounts.

The timing of our cash flows from operating activities can also vary among periods due to the timing by which payments are made or received. Some of our payments and receipts, including loss settlements and subsequent reinsurance receipts, can be significant. Therefore, their timing can influence cash flows from operating activities in any given period. The potential for a large claim under an insurance or reinsurance contract means that our insurance subsidiaries may need to make substantial payments within relatively short periods of time, which would have a negative impact on our operating cash flows.

We generated positive cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Management believes that cash receipts from premium, proceeds from investment sales and redemptions, and investment income and reinsurance recoveries, if necessary, are sufficient to cover cash outflows in the foreseeable future.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Our cash flow from operating activities has been positive in each of the last two years. Variations in operating cash flow between periods are primarily driven by variations in our gross and ceded written premiums and the volume and timing of premium receipts, claim payments, reinsurance payments, and reinsurance recoveries on paid losses. In addition, fluctuations in losses and loss adjustment expenses and other insurance operating expenses impact operating cash flow.

Cash used in investing activities for each of the last two years related primarily to purchases of fixed income and equity securities in excess of sales and maturities.

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the receipt of $115.7 million in proceeds from a stock offering, $7.0 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, $2.8 million in proceeds from policy holder contributions of surplus and $0.9 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan, offset by $52.6 million in payments on our FHLB line of credit. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the repurchase of $22.3 million of our common stock, offset by $16.2 million in proceeds from our FHLB line of credit, $1.2 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $0.8 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan.

We do not have any current plans for material capital expenditures other than current operating requirements. We believe that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and beyond. The key factor that will affect our future operating cash flows is the frequency and severity of catastrophic loss events. To the extent our future operating cash flows are insufficient to cover our net losses from catastrophic events, we had $1,068.3 million in cash and investment securities available at December 31, 2024. We also have the ability to access additional capital through pursuing third-party borrowings including our credit agreements, sales of our equity or debt securities, or entrance into a reinsurance arrangement.

The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents management’s estimate of the ultimate cost of settling losses. As more fully discussed in “—Critical Accounting Policies—Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” below, the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on various complex and subjective judgments. Actual losses paid may differ, perhaps significantly, from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Similarly, the timing of payment of our estimated losses is not fixed and there may be significant changes in actual payment activity. The assumptions used in estimating the likely payments due by period are based on our historical claims payment experience and industry payment patterns, but due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of such payments, there is a risk that the amounts paid can be significantly different from the amounts disclosed above.

The amounts in the above table represent our gross estimates of known liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and do not include any allowance for claims for future events within the time period specified. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the total amounts of obligations paid by us in the time periods shown will be greater than those indicated in the table.

Share repurchases

Our share repurchase program expired on March 31, 2024 and we did not make any share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Credit Agreement

In December 2021, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association which provides a revolving credit facility of up to $100 million through December 8, 2026. Interest on the credit facility accrues on each SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) rate loan at the applicable SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.75% and on each base rate loan at the applicable Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.75%. A loan may be either a SOFR rate loan or a base rate loan, at our discretion. Outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid in full or in part at any time with no prepayment premium and may be reduced in full or in part at any time upon prior notice. Currently, $5.6 million of the borrowing capacity of the Credit Agreement is pledged as collateral and not able to be utilized.

As of December 31, 2024 we do not have any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, but we may seek to borrow under the Credit Agreement in the future.

 ​

Our PSIC subsidiary is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLB”). Membership in the FHLB provides PSIC access to collateralized advances, which can be drawn for general corporate purposes and used to enhance liquidity management. All borrowings are fully secured by a pledge of specific investment securities of PSIC and the borrowing capacity is equal to 10% of PSIC’s statutory admitted assets. All advances have predetermined term and the interest rate varies based on the term of the advance.

 ​

As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding through the FHLB line of credit.

Financial Condition

Stockholders
’
 Equity

At December 31, 2024 total stockholders’ equity was $729.0 million and tangible stockholders’ equity was $715.8 million, compared to total stockholders’ equity of $471.3 million and tangible stockholders’ equity of $458.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Stockholders’ equity increased primarily due to net income we earned for the period, stock offering proceeds, and activity related to stock-based compensation.  Stock-based compensation expense is treated as an additional paid-in-capital and increases stockholders’ equity.

Tangible stockholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of stockholders’ equity in accordance with GAAP to tangible stockholders’ equity.

Investment Portfolio

Our primary investment objectives are to maintain liquidity, preserve capital and generate a stable level of investment income. We purchase securities that we believe are attractive on a relative value basis and seek to generate returns in excess of predetermined benchmarks. Our Board of Directors approves our investment guidelines in compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions on asset type, quality and concentration. Our current investment guidelines allow us to invest in taxable and tax-exempt fixed maturities, as well as publicly traded mutual funds and common stock of individual companies. Our cash and invested assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturity securities, and equity securities. As of December 31, 2024, the majority of our investment portfolio, or $939.0 million, was comprised of fixed maturity securities that are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses on these securities, net of applicable taxes, reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Also included in our investment portfolio were $40.5 million of equity securities. In addition, we maintained a non-restricted cash and cash equivalent balance of $80.5 million at December 31, 2024. Our fixed maturity securities, including cash equivalents, had a weighted average effective duration of 4.04 and 3.48 years and an average rating of A1/A+ and “Aa3/A+” at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our fixed income investment portfolio had a book yield of 4.59% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 4.07% as of December 31, 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. For a detailed discussion of our accounting policies, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at the balance sheet date. We do not discount this reserve. We seek to establish reserves that will ultimately prove to be adequate.

We categorize our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses into two types: case reserves and reserves for incurred but not yet reported losses (“IBNR”). Through our third-party administrators (“TPAs”), we generally are notified of losses by our insureds or their agents or brokers. Based on the information provided by the TPAs, we establish initial case reserves by estimating the ultimate losses from the claim, including administrative costs associated with the ultimate settlement of the claim. Our personnel use their knowledge of the specific claim along with internal and external experts, including underwriters and legal counsel, to estimate the expected ultimate losses.

      75

Table of Contents

We establish IBNR reserves to provide for (i) the estimated amount of future loss payments on incurred claims not yet reported, and (ii) potential development on reported claims. IBNR reserves are estimated based on generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques that consider quantitative loss experience data and, where appropriate, qualitative factors. We use statistical analysis to estimate the cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses related to IBNR. Those estimates are based on our historical information, industry information and practices, and estimates of trends that may affect the ultimate frequency of incurred but not reported claims and changes in ultimate claims severity.

We regularly review our reserve estimates and adjust them as necessary as experience develops or as new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations. During the loss settlement period, if we have indications that claims frequency or severity exceeds our initial expectations, we generally increase our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Conversely, when claims frequency and severity trends are more favorable than initially anticipated, we generally reduce our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses once we have sufficient data to confirm the validity of the favorable trends. Even after such adjustments, the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimate included in our consolidated financial statements.

The following tables summarize our gross and net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The process of estimating the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses requires a high degree of judgment and is subject to several variables. On a quarterly basis, we perform an analysis of our loss development and select the expected ultimate loss ratio for each of our product lines by exposure period. In our actuarial analysis, we use input from our TPAs and our underwriting departments, including premium pricing assumptions and historical experience. Multiple actuarial methods are used to estimate the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses. These methods utilize, to varying degrees, the initial expected loss ratio, detailed statistical analysis of past claims reporting and payment patterns, claims frequency and severity, paid loss experience, industry loss experience, and changes in market conditions, policy forms, exclusions, and exposures. The actuarial methods used to estimate loss reserves are:

●

Reported and/or Paid Loss Development Methods
—Ultimate losses are estimated based on historical reported and/or paid loss patterns. Reported losses are the sum of paid and case losses. Industry development patterns are substituted for historical development patterns when sufficient historical data is not available.

●

IBNR-to-Case Reserve Ratio Method
—This method calculates ratios of IBNR to case reserves based on incurred and paid development factors from the development methods. Estimated IBNR equals the product of case reserves and the IBNR-to-case reserve ratio. These IBNR amounts are added to the reported-to-date amount to derive ultimate losses.

 ​

      76

Table of Contents

●

Reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson Severity Method
—Under this method, ultimate losses are estimated as the sum of cumulative reported losses and estimated IBNR losses. IBNR losses are estimated based on expected average severity, estimated ultimate claim counts and the historical development patterns of reported losses.

●

Reported Bornhuetter Ferguson Pure Premium Method
—Under this method, ultimate losses are estimated as the sum of cumulative reported losses and estimated IBNR losses. IBNR losses are estimated based on expected pure premium and on the historical development patterns of reported losses.

The method(s) used vary based on the line of business and the nature of the loss event. Development patterns for catastrophic events are based on the time since event versus an accident quarter and year pattern used for non-catastrophic events. Considering each of the alternative ultimate estimates, we select an estimate of ultimate loss for each line of business.

Loss Adjustment Expense reserves are estimated based on the ratio of paid loss adjustment expense to paid loss, which is estimated separately by line of business as well as split by hurricane and excluding hurricane. We then apply this ratio to our estimated unpaid loss, by multiplying the ratio times 50% of loss case reserves and 100% of loss IBNR reserves. This is applied by line of business and accident year to arrive at estimated unpaid loss adjustment expense on a gross basis. We then add the estimated unpaid loss adjustment expense on a gross basis to the paid loss adjustment expense to calculate estimated ultimate loss adjustment expense.

On a quarterly basis, the leaders of our executive management, accounting, actuarial, and claims teams meet to review the recommendations made by our actuarial team and use their best judgment to determine the best estimate to be recorded for the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses on our balance sheet.

Our reserves are driven by several important factors, including litigation and regulatory trends, legislative activity, climate change, social and economic patterns and claims inflation assumptions. Our reserve estimates reflect current inflation in legal claims’ settlements and assume we will not be subject to losses from significant new legal liability theories. Our reserve estimates assume that there will not be significant changes in the regulatory and legislative environment. The impact of potential changes in the regulatory or legislative environment is difficult to quantify in the absence of specific, significant new regulation or legislation. In the event of significant new regulation or legislation, we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business, but no assurance can be given that our attempt to quantify such inputs will be accurate or successful.  

The table below quantifies the impact of potential reserve deviations from our carried reserve at December 31, 2024. We applied sensitivity factors to incurred losses for the three most recent accident years and to the carried reserve for all prior accident years combined. We believe that potential changes such as these would not have a material impact on our liquidity.

The amount by which estimated losses differ from those originally reported for a period is known as “development.” Development is unfavorable when the losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on unresolved claims. Development is favorable when losses ultimately settle for less than the amount reserved, or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reducing loss reserves on unresolved claims. We reflect favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, our total gross incurred losses for accident years 2023 and prior developed favorably by $43.2 million. The gross favorable development was due primarily to lower than anticipated severity of attritional losses in our Inland Marine and other property line of business. On a net basis, the development was favorable by $3.0 million due to the same reason.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, our total gross incurred losses for accident years 2022 and prior developed favorably by $35.8 million. The gross favorable development was due primarily to lower than anticipated severity of catastrophe losses, offset by higher than anticipated severity of attritional losses. On a net basis, the development was unfavorable by $2.2 million due to the effect of ceding gross favorable development under our catastrophe XOL reinsurance program and due to unfavorable development on lines of business subject to lower amounts of ceding. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, our total gross incurred losses for accident years 2021 and prior developed unfavorably by $0.3 million. The gross unfavorable development was due primarily to losses on certain 2020 Hurricanes emerging at a higher severity than expected, primarily in our special property lines of business. This was offset by favorable development on 2021 attritional and catastrophe losses. On a net basis, the development was unfavorable by $2.4 million due to the effect of ceding under our reinsurance program. The favorable 2021 development was subject to a higher amount of ceding versus the unfavorable 2020 development resulting in the net unfavorable development being higher than the gross amount.

Table of Contents

Although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions. Specifically, our actual ultimate loss ratio could differ from our initial expected loss ratio or our actual reporting and payment patterns could differ from our expected reporting and payment patterns, which are based on our own data and industry data. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We regularly review our estimates and adjust them as necessary as experience develops or as new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in the results of current operations.

Investment Valuation and Fair Value

We invest in a variety of investment grade fixed maturity securities, including U.S. government issues, state government issues, mortgage and asset-backed obligations, and corporate bonds. All of our investments in fixed maturity securities and equity securities are carried at fair value, defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress.

In our disclosure of the fair value of our investments, we utilize a hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to estimate fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date.

Level 2—Pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar investments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar investments in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3—Pricing inputs into models are unobservable for the investment. The unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.

We use independent pricing sources to obtain the estimated fair values of investments. The fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is based on a variety of valuation techniques depending on the type of investment. The fair values obtained from independent pricing sources are reviewed for reasonableness and any discrepancies are investigated for final valuation.

The fair value of our investments in fixed maturity securities is estimated using relevant inputs, including available market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. An Option Adjusted Spread model is also used to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. These fair value measurements are estimated based on observable, objectively verifiable market information rather than market quotes; therefore, these investments are classified and disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy.

The fair value of our investments in equity securities is based on quoted prices available in active markets and classified and disclosed in Level 1 of the hierarchy.

Investment securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in issuer-specific circumstances, such as credit rating, and changes in industry-specific circumstances, such as movements in credit spreads based on the market’s perception of industry risks. In addition, fixed maturities are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in interest rates. As a result of these potential fluctuations, it is possible to have significant unrealized gains or losses on a security. Unrealized gains and losses on our fixed maturity securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of total stockholders’ equity. Equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of net income on the Company’s consolidated statement of income.

      79

Table of Contents

All financial assets, including available-for-sale securities are required to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected by means of an allowance for credit losses that is included in net income. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are also required to be recorded through a reversible allowance for credit losses, but the allowance is limited to the amount by which fair value is less than amortized cost.

The Company reviews all securities with unrealized losses on a regular basis to assess whether the decline in the securities fair value necessitates the recognition of an allowance for credit losses. Factors considered in the review include the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, and current market interest rates and whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates. The Company also considers factors specific to the issuer including the general financial condition of the issuer, the issuers industry and future business prospects, any past failure of issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and the payment structure of the investment and the issuers ability to make contractual payments on the investment.

The Company also considers whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. When assessing whether it intends to sell a fixed-maturity security or if it is likely to be required to sell a fixed-maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost, the Company evaluates facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition the investment portfolio, potential sales of investments to meet cash flow needs, and potential sales of investments to capitalize on favorable pricing.

For fixed-maturity securities where a decline in fair value is below the amortized cost basis and the Company intends to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, a credit-loss charge is recognized in net income based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment. For fixed-maturity securities that the Company has the intent and ability to hold, the Company compares the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost of the security. The extent to which the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security represents the credit-related portion of the impairment, which is recognized in net income through an allowance for credit losses. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the noncredit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Company reports accrued interest receivable as a component of accrued investment income on its consolidated balance sheet which is presented separately from available-for-sale securities. The Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable and instead would write off accrued interest receivable at the time an issuer defaults or is expected to default on payments.

The Company has one investment in a limited liability company which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby the investment carrying amount is adjusted in subsequent periods to reflect the Company's share of earnings or losses. The Company also invests a small portion of its portfolio in limited partnerships, which are classified as other investments on its consolidated balance sheet. These investments are measured at estimated fair value utilizing a net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.

Deferred Income Taxes

We account for taxes under the asset and liability method, under which we record deferred income taxes as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet to reflect the net tax effect of the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse.

Our deferred tax assets result from temporary differences primarily attributable to unearned premiums, net operating losses (“NOLs”), unrealized losses on investments and deferred compensation. Our deferred tax liabilities result primarily from deferred acquisition costs, internally developed software, and unrealized gains in the investment portfolio.

We recognize deferred tax assets when we determine that such assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized in future periods. In making such a determination, we consider all available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income, projected future tax rates, and results of recent operations. On a quarterly basis, we review our deferred tax assets and, if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we reduce our deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance. The assessment requires significant judgement and review of all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some of portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Table of Contents

In assessing the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, we are required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information regarding reversals of existing temporary differences, carryback capacity, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Recent events, including changes in market interest rates and significant financial market volatility have caused us to incur unrealized losses on investments which contributes to us having a net capital deferred tax asset in the amount of $5.3 million at December 31, 2024, as compared to a net capital deferred tax asset of $5.9 million at December 31, 2023. We are currently utilizing tax planning strategies in our assessment of the realizability of a portion of our net capital deferred tax asset at December 31, 2024. These tax planning strategies include the holding of fixed maturity securities that are currently in a net unrealized loss position for tax purposes until recovery or maturity, if needed, to avoid future expiring capital loss carryforwards.

 ​

As of December 31, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $3.4 million relating to our state net operating loss carryforwards and the remainder of our deferred tax assets did not require a valuation allowance.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See “Note 2—Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting pronouncements recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted and their potential impact to our financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our consolidated balance sheets include assets and liabilities with estimated fair values that are subject to market risk. Our primary market risks have been equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities and interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities. We do not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity risk.

Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in an issuer’s ability to repay its debt obligations. General concern exists about the number of municipalities experiencing financial difficulties in light of the adverse economic conditions experienced over the past several years. We manage the exposure to credit risk in our municipal bond portfolio by investing in high quality securities and by diversifying our holdings, which are typically either general obligation or revenue bonds related to essential products and services. We manage the exposure to credit risk in our corporate bond portfolio by investing in high quality securities and by diversifying our holdings.

We monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that credit risk does not exceed prudent levels. The majority of our investment portfolio is invested in high credit quality, investment grade fixed maturity securities. We also invest in higher yielding fixed maturities and equity securities. Our fixed maturity portfolio has an average rating by at least one nationally recognized rating organization of “AA−,” with approximately 73.5% rated “A−” or better. At December 31, 2024, 1.3% of our fixed maturity portfolio was unrated or rated below investment grade. Our fixed maturity portfolio includes some securities issued with financial guaranty insurance. We purchase fixed maturities based on our assessment of the credit quality of the underlying assets without regard to insurance.

      81

Table of Contents

Interest Rate Risk

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset/liability matching and capital management process. In the management of this risk, the characteristics of duration, credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements. We regularly assess these risks and balance them within the context of our liability and capital position.

As of December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of our fixed maturities was $939.0 million. We estimate that a 100-basis point increase in interest rates would cause a 3.7% decline in the estimated fair value of our fixed maturities portfolio, while a 100-basis point decrease in interest rates would cause a 4.0% increase in the estimated fair value of that portfolio. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of our fixed maturities portfolio.

Equity Price Risk

Equity risk represents the potential economic losses due to adverse changes in equity security prices.  As of December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of our equity securities was $40.5 million.  Our equity securities consist primarily of exchange traded funds which seek to track the performance of the broader U.S. stock market. Therefore, the fair value of our equity securities will fluctuate with the value of the overall U.S. stock market and a large decline in the value of the U.S. stock market would cause a corresponding decline in the value of our equity securities.

Inflation

We establish our insurance premiums prior to knowing the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts. We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in our pricing and our establishing of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause losses and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated. Inflation assumptions also impact our reinsurance costs and the amount of reinsurance we must purchase to meet certain thresholds and higher inflation assumptions cause our reinsurance costs to increase.

Substantial future increases in inflation could also result in future increases in interest rates, which in turn are likely to result in a decline in the market value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized losses or reductions in total stockholders’ equity.

Seasonality

Our Inland Marine and Other Property line of business exposes us to claims from seasonal weather events such as hurricanes and windstorms. The occurrence of such events typically increases between June and November of each year. As a result, we may experience increased losses in our Inland Marine and Other Property line of business during this period.  We also write and earn the majority of our Crop premiums during the third quarter of each year.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 ​

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Palomar Holdings, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

 ​

We have audited Palomar Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Palomar Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)

and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

 ​

Basis for Opinion

 ​

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 ​

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 ​

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

 ​

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Palomar Holdings, Inc.

 ​

 ​

Opinion on the Financial Statements

 ​

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Palomar Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)  (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

 ​

Basis for Opinion

 ​

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Valuation of Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Description of

the Matter

At December 31, 2024, the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) is $503,382 (in thousands). As explained in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the reserve for losses and LAE represents management's best estimate for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses on reported losses and estimates of losses incurred but not reported (IBNR), net of salvage and subrogation recoveries. The liability is based on individual claims, case reserves and other estimates reported by policyholders, as well as management estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claims severity and frequency and other factors that could vary significantly as claims are settled. IBNR reserves include an estimate for future loss payments on incurred claims not yet reported and for expected development on reported claims. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management’s best estimate of IBNR, which is sensitive to significant assumptions including the selection of actuarial methods and reported and paid loss emergence patterns.

Auditing management’s best estimate of IBNR reserves was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the assumptions, including selection of actuarial methods and reported and paid loss emergence patterns, used in the valuation process. These assumptions have a significant effect on the valuation of reserves for IBNR claims.

How We Addressed the Matter

in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the process for estimating IBNR reserves. This included, among other procedures, testing management review controls in place over the review and approval of methods and assumptions used in estimating IBNR reserves. 

To test IBNR reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation by testing reconciliations of the underlying claims and policyholder data recorded in the source systems to the actuarial reserving calculations and comparing a sample of incurred and paid claims to source documentation. With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the Company’s selection and weighting of actuarial methods compared to methods used in prior periods and in the industry for the specific types of insurance. To evaluate the significant assumptions used by management, we compared the assumptions to current and historical claims trends and to current industry benchmarks. We compared the Company’s recorded reserves to a range of reasonable reserve estimates developed by our actuarial specialists based on independently selected methods and assumptions. We also compared the results of the reserve study prepared by the Company’s actuarial specialists to management’s recorded reserve.  Additionally, we performed a hindsight analysis of the prior period estimates using subsequent claims development.

 Summary of Operations and Basis of Presentation

Summary of Operations

Palomar Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware incorporated insurance holding company that was founded in 
2014.
 The Company has several wholly owned subsidiaries including an Oregon domiciled insurance company, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company (“PSIC”), a Bermuda based reinsurance company, Palomar Specialty Reinsurance Company Bermuda Ltd. (“PSRE”), an Arizona domiciled surplus lines insurance company, Palomar Excess and Surplus Insurance Company (“PESIC”), a California domiciled property and casualty insurance agency, Palomar Insurance Agency, DBA Palomar General Insurance Agency (“PGIA”), and a Delaware incorporated management company, Palomar Underwriters Exchange Organization, Inc. ("PUEO").

PSIC is a property and casualty insurance company domiciled in the state of Oregon.  PSIC is licensed to underwrite insurance on an admitted basis in 
44
 states in the United States, as of 
 December 31, 2024
, mainly through managing general insurance agencies, wholesale brokers, and independent agents.

PSRE is a Bermuda captive reinsurance company that has historically been used to reinsure certain premiums on a quota share basis exclusively for PSIC.

PESIC is an Arizona domiciled surplus lines insurance company. PESIC is licensed in Arizona to write surplus lines policies across all the Company’s lines of business and was formed and began writing policies in 
2020.

PGIA is a property and casualty general insurance agency for PSIC, PESIC, and unaffiliated insurance carriers. As a general insurance agency, PGIA assists in developing insurance products, underwriting insurance policies, and receiving and disbursing funds from premium and loss transactions under contracts on behalf of insurance companies. PGIA earns commissions from the product development, marketing, and servicing of the insurance companies’ programs. PGIA also earns fee income from policyholder transactions.

PUEO is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 
2023
 and provides management services to Laulima Exchange ("Laulima"), a Hawaii domiciled reciprocal exchange, as its attorney-in-fact. Laulima was formed in 
2023
 and is comprised of an unincorporated association of Hawaii homeowners ("subscribers") that agree to insure 
one
 another. 

The Company operates as an insurance holding company system and is subject to the insurance holding company laws of the States of Oregon and Arizona, the states in which PSIC and PESIC are domiciled. The Company is also commercially domiciled in California, making it subject to California insurance holding company laws. These statutes require that each insurance company in the system register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that 
 may 
materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system and domiciled in that state.

Segment Reporting

The Company has a single operating segment, the property and casualty insurance business. The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is the Chief Executive Officer.  The significant segment expenses provided to the CODM are consistent with the categories shown in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and there are 
no
 other segment items used by the CODM.  The CODM reviews the Company's revenue, expenses and net income as reported under GAAP, which is the primary measure of segment profit or loss. The CODM reviews these measures, comparing them to prior periods and expectations, and makes resource allocation decisions based on the analysis. While the Company’s CODM also reviews the revenue streams attributable to individual products, operations are managed, resources are allocated, and financial performance is evaluated on a consolidated basis.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of Laulima, as Laulima is a variable interest entity ("VIE") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

92

Table of Contents

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. All revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised. Significant estimates reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements include, but are 
not
 limited to, reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, and the fair values of investments.

2.
 Significant Accounting Policies

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and marketable securities with original maturities of 
three
 months or less at acquisition and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company maintains cash balances in federally insured financial institutions.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash includes cash on deposit with reinsurance carriers. Restricted cash also includes cash held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of 
third
-party insurance carriers.

Investments

All of the Company’s investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.

Investment income consists primarily of interest and dividends. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are amortized or accrued using the prospective method which considers anticipated prepayments at the date of purchase. To the extent that the estimated lives of such securities change as a result of changes in estimated prepayment rates, the adjustments are included in net investment income using the prospective method. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Net investment income represents investment income, net of expenses.

Unrealized gains and losses related to fixed maturity securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of net income on the Company’s consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. The Company uses the specific-identification method to determine the cost of fixed maturity securities sold and the 
first
-in, 
first
-out method for lots of equity securities sold. The Company has 
one
 investment in a limited liability company which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting whereby the investment carrying amount is adjusted in subsequent periods to reflect the Company's share of earnings or losses. Gains or losses from this equity method investment are recognized as a component of realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in the Company's Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company also invests a small portion of its portfolio in limited partnerships, which are classified as other investments on the consolidated balance sheet. These investments are measured at estimated fair value utilizing a net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Gains or losses from other investments are recognized as a component of realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in the Company's Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income.

The Company reviews all securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis to assess whether the decline in the securities fair value necessitates the recognition of an allowance for credit losses. Factors considered in the review include the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, and current market interest rates and whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates. The Company also considers factors specific to the issuer including the general financial condition of the issuer, the issuers industry and future business prospects, any past failure of issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and the payment structure of the investment and the issuers ability to make contractual payments on the investment.

The Company also considers whether it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than 
not
 that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. When assessing whether it intends to sell a fixed-maturity security or if it is likely to be required to sell a fixed-maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost, the Company evaluates facts and circumstances including, but 
not
 limited to, decisions to reposition the investment portfolio, potential sales of investments to meet cash flow needs, and potential sales of investments to capitalize on favorable pricing.

93

Table of Contents

For fixed-maturity securities where a decline in fair value is below the amortized cost basis and the Company intends to sell the security, or it is more likely than 
not
 that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, a credit-loss charge is recognized in net income based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment. For fixed-maturity securities that the Company has the intent and ability to hold, the Company compares the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost of the security. The extent to which the estimated present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security represents the credit-related portion of the impairment, which is recognized in net income through an allowance for credit losses. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the noncredit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Company reports accrued interest receivable as a component of accrued investment income on its consolidated balance sheet which is presented separately from available-for-sale securities. The Company does 
not
 measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable and instead would write off accrued interest receivable at the time an issuer defaults or is expected to default on payments.

Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment.

The 
three
-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the 
three
 broad levels listed below:

Level 
1—Unadjusted
 quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date.

Level 
2—Pricing
 inputs are quoted prices for similar investments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar investments in inactive markets; or valuation based on models where the significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 
3—Pricing
 inputs into models are unobservable for the investment. The unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.

To measure fair value, the Company obtains quoted market prices for its investment securities from its outside investment managers. If a quoted market price is 
not
 available, the Company uses prices of similar securities. The fair values obtained from the outside investment managers are reviewed for reasonableness and any discrepancies are investigated for final valuation.

The fair value of the Company’s investments in fixed maturity securities is estimated using relevant inputs, including available market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. An Option Adjusted Spread model is also used to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios. Industry standard models are used to analyze and value securities with embedded options or prepayment sensitivities. These fair value measurements are estimated based on observable, objectively verifiable market information rather than market quotes; therefore, these investments are classified and disclosed in Level 
2
 of the hierarchy.

The fair value of the Company’s investments in equity securities is based on quoted prices available in active markets and classified and disclosed in Level 
1
 of the hierarchy.

94

Table of Contents

Variable Interest Entities ("VIE")

A VIE is a legal entity that does 
not
 have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights or do 
not
 participate in the gains and losses of the entity. The Company consolidates VIEs in which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (
1
) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE and (
2
) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect that entity’s economic performance.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturity securities and reinsurance recoverables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions and its fixed maturity securities in securities of the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, and high credit quality issuers of debt securities. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and reinsures its business with highly rated reinsurers and sometimes requires letters of credit or retains funds from reinsurers (see Note 
10
).

Premiums Receivable

Premiums receivable represent amounts due from policyholders, insurance agents, or program administrators for policies written. Generally, premiums are collected prior to providing risk coverage, minimizing the Company’s exposure to credit risk. Premiums receivable are short-term in nature and due within a year. The Company has established an allowance for uncollectible premiums related to its credit risk, which it reviews on a quarterly basis and adjusts as appropriate. The company considers the current economic environment, specific regulatory developments, and historic payment and cancelation trends by line of business and location when determining whether to record an allowance for uncollectible premiums.

The Company recorded an immaterial allowance for uncollectible premiums as of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
 December 31, 2023
, and believes that all other amounts are collectable.

Earned Premiums

Gross premiums written are recorded at policy inception and are earned as revenue ratably over the term of the respective policies. Premiums written 
not
 yet recognized as revenue are reflected as unearned premiums on the balance sheet, or as advanced premiums if received prior to the policy effective date. Premiums written where cash is 
not
 yet received are recognized as premiums receivable.

A premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, unamortized acquisition costs, and policy maintenance costs exceeds the remaining unearned premiums. A premium deficiency would 
first
 be recognized by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to expense to the extent required to eliminate the deficiency. If the premium deficiency were greater than unamortized acquisition costs, a liability would be accrued for the excess deficiency. The Company does 
not
 consider anticipated investment income when determining if a premium deficiency exists. There was 
no
 premium deficiency at 
 December 31, 2024
 or 
2023
.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

The costs of successfully acquiring new business, principally commission expense and premium taxes, are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies in force, net of any ceding commissions or fronting fees and are shown as acquisition expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

Commission and Other Income

Commission and other income is comprised of commissions and fees earned in conjunction with underwriting policies. Commission and fee income is earned at the time the policy is written.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are capitalized and carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis using useful lives of 
3
 to 
5
 years. Leasehold improvements and other fixed assets are capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the properties and equipment. Expenditure for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Upon disposition, the asset cost and related depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the Company’s results of operations.

95

Table of Contents

Capitalized Software

Costs associated with the implementation of certain internal systems are capitalized and carried at capitalized cost less accumulated amortization and are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Costs capitalized include internal personnel costs, external developer costs, and interest. The implementation costs relate to systems built on software which the Company purchases under a cloud computing arrangement and accounts for as a service contract. As such, capitalized costs are amortized over the term of the service contract.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Intangible assets consist of both finite and indefinite lived assets. Finite lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships which are amortized over a period of 
8
 years. Indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of state licenses acquired upon formation of the Company. Goodwill was recognized as a result of a business acquisition during 
2023.
 Intangible assets and goodwill are initially recognized and measured at fair value and are subsequently evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances warrant. 
No
 impairments of intangible assets or goodwill were recognized for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 or 
2022
.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever recognized events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, the fair value is calculated using estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of those assets. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is 
not
 recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is 
not
 recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. This assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset or asset group at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. 
No
 impairments of long-lived assets were recognized for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 or 
2022
.

Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes estimates for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses on reported losses and estimates of losses incurred but 
not
 reported (“IBNR”), net of salvage and subrogation recoveries. The liability is based on individual claims, case reserves and other estimates reported by policyholders, as well as management estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. Inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are expected trends in claims severity and frequency and other factors that could vary significantly as claims are settled.

The Company’s estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses are based in part upon the estimation of claims resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Estimation by management of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the potential severity of property catastrophe claims. Therefore, the Company uses both proprietary and commercially available models, as well as historic claims experience, for purposes of providing an estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Reserves for IBNR are established in accordance with industry practice to provide for (i) the estimated amount of future loss payments on incurred claims 
not
 yet reported, and (ii) potential development on reported claims. IBNR reserves are estimated based on generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques that consider quantitative loss experience data and, where appropriate, qualitative factors.

96

Table of Contents

Ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
 may 
vary materially from the amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are reviewed regularly and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the liabilities are adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, if any, are reflected in operations in the period in which they become known and are accounted for as changes in estimates. The Company does 
not
 discount its liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Reinsurance

The Company purchases excess of loss and quota share reinsurance to protect it against the impact of losses. The Company also writes premiums under fronting agreements where it cedes the majority of premium and risk to reinsurers in exchange for a fronting fee. Reinsurance premiums, commissions, and ceded unearned premiums are accounted for on bases consistent with the underlying terms of the reinsurance contracts and in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. The Company receives ceding commissions and fronting fees in connection with quota share and fronting reinsurance contracts. The ceding commissions and fronting fees are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of acquisition expenses. Amounts applicable to ceded unearned premiums are reported as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Premiums earned and losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred are stated in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income net of amounts ceded to reinsurers.

Reinsurance recoverables represent balances due to the Company from its reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Company is exposed to credit losses from reinsurers being unable to meet their obligations. The Company evaluates the financial condition of potential reinsurers and reinsures its business with highly rated reinsurers with a rating of “A-“ (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) or better from A.M. Best. Reinsurers who do 
not
 meet the Company’s rating criteria are required to post collateral. The Company reviews credit quality of its reinsurers on a quarterly basis. The Company’s reinsurance contracts also include special termination provisions that allow the Company to cancel and replace any participating reinsurer that is downgraded below a rating of “A−” from A.M. Best, or whose surplus drops by more than 
20%.
 Historically, the Company has experienced minimal credit losses from reinsurance recoverables and did 
not
 have an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables as of 
 December 31, 2024
 or 
 December 31, 2023
.

Stock Based Compensation Expense

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of awards. The Company does 
not
 apply a forfeiture rate to unvested awards and accounts for forfeitures as they occur. For stock option grants, the fair value of awards is estimated using the Black Scholes Model. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined using the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The fair value of performance stock units containing employee service or company financial performance-based conditions is determined using the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The fair value of performance stock units containing conditions based on performance of the Company’s stock is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. All stock-based compensation is included in other underwriting expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

 ​

Income Taxes

The Company is taxed as a property/casualty insurer for federal income tax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

97

Table of Contents

The Company recognizes the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions where the position is more likely than 
not
 to be sustained assuming examination by taxing authorities. Based on its evaluation for the tax years ended 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the Company has concluded that there are 
no
 significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, as a component of income tax expense. The Company has 
not
 been assessed interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions for the respective tax years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
, or 
2022
.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the dilution which could occur if equity-based awards are converted into common share equivalents as calculated using the treasury stock method. When inclusion of additional common share equivalents increases the earnings per share or reduces the loss per share, the effect on earnings per share is anti-dilutive, and the diluted net earnings or net loss per share is computed excluding these common share equivalents.

The Company reviewed the above securities at each balance sheet date to consider whether it was necessary to recognize a credit loss related to any of these securities. An allowance for credit losses of $
0.2
 million and $
0.9
 million was recorded pertaining to 
one
 investment security as of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, respectively. For the remaining securities, the Company determined that the fixed maturity securities’ unrealized losses were primarily the result of the interest rate environment and 
not
 the credit quality of the issuers. The Company does 
not
 intend to sell the investments and it is 
not
 more likely than 
not
 that the Company will be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.

 Leases

 ​

The Company has operating leases for office space used to conduct its insurance operations and administration activities. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are a component of prepaid expenses and other assets and operating lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

 ​

The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. To determine the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which it calculates based on information available at the lease commencement date. For certain leases that contain options to extend, the options are included in lease liabilities only if the company is reasonably certain the option will be exercised. Variable lease costs such as parking are expensed in the period the obligation is incurred and are 
not
 included in the Company’s operating lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do 
not
 contain any residual value guarantees.

 ​

Operating lease costs for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
 were $
0.8
 million, $
0.8
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively. Operating lease costs are comprised of rental expense for operating leases. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included as a component of other underwriting expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

 Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
, and 
2022
. The Company does 
not
 discount loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and statistical analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency.

In addition to case reserves, which are generally based on reported claims, the Company establishes reserves for incurred but 
not
 reported claims (“IBNR”). IBNR reserves are developed to provide for (i) the estimated amount of future loss payments on incurred claims 
not
 yet reported, and (ii) potential development on reported claims. IBNR reserves are estimated based on generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques that consider quantitative loss experience data and, where appropriate, qualitative factors. The Company uses statistical analysis to estimate the cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses related to IBNR. Those estimates are based on historical information, industry information and practices, and estimates of trends that 
 may 
affect the ultimate frequency of incurred but 
not
 reported claims and changes in ultimate claims severity.

The Company regularly reviews its reserve estimates and adjusts them as necessary as experience develops or as new information becomes known. Such adjustments are included in current operations. During the loss settlement period, if there are indications that claims frequency or severity exceeds initial expectations, the Company generally increases its reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Conversely, when claims frequency and severity trends are more favorable than initially anticipated, the Company generally reduces its reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses once it has sufficient data to confirm the validity of the favorable trends. Even after such adjustments, the ultimate liability 
 may 
exceed or be less than the revised estimates. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses 
 may 
vary significantly from the estimate included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, management believes the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. Any adjustments to estimates are recorded in the current period.

The foregoing reconciliation shows favorable net development of $
3.0
 million in 
2024
 and unfavorable net development of $
2.2
 million and $
2.4
 million in 
2023
 and 
2022,
 respectively.

During 
2024,
 the net favorable reserve development was primarily due to lower than anticipated severity of attritional losses in our Inland Marine and other property line of business.

During 
2023,
 the net unfavorable reserve development was primarily due to the effect of ceding gross favorable development under our catastrophe XOL reinsurance program and due to unfavorable development on lines of business subject to lower amounts of ceding. During 
2022,
 the net unfavorable reserve development was primarily attributable to prior year catastrophe events including certain 
2020
 Hurricanes, offset by favorable development related to 
2021
 attritional and catastrophe losses. 

The Company compiles and aggregates its claims data by grouping the claims according to the year in which the claim occurred (“Accident Year”) when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time. For the purpose of defining claims frequency, the number of reported claims is by loss occurrence and includes claims that do 
not
 result in a liability or payment associated with them.

 The following tables show information about the Company’s incurred and paid loss development as of 
 December 31, 2024, 
net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency, the total of IBNR liabilities included within the net incurred loss amounts and the average historical claims duration as of 
 December 31, 2024. 
The loss information has been disaggregated so that losses that are expected to develop in a similar manner are grouped together. The information provided herein about incurred and paid accident year claims development for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
 and prior is presented as unaudited supplementary information.

Reflects the Company’s share of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense related to non-proportional assumed reinsurance business. This amount reflects gross and net reserves related to this treaty and the ultimate incurred amount reflects IBNR only. The Company does 
not
 have direct access to individual claim information underlying the assumed quota share arrangement. The Company does 
not
 use claim frequency information in the determination of loss reserves or for other internal purposes. Based on these considerations, the Company does 
not
 believe providing claims frequency information is practicable as it relates to this line of business.

10.
 Reinsurance

The Company utilizes reinsurance in order to limit its exposure to losses and enable it to underwrite policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs. The Company primarily utilizes excess of loss (XOL) and quota share reinsurance to protect against catastrophe and attritional losses. The Company also writes premiums under fronting agreements, whereby the majority of premium and risk is ceded to reinsurers and the Company receives a fronting fee.

In an XOL treaty, the Company retains losses for any occurrence up to a specified amount (its “retention”) and reinsurers assume any losses above that amount. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company’s catastrophe event retention is $
20
 million for earthquake events and $
15.5
 million for hurricane events and all other perils. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company’s reinsurance structure provides protection up to $
3.08
 billion for earthquake events, $
735
 million for Hawaii hurricane events, and $
117.5
 million for continental U.S. hurricane events.

In a quota share agreement, the Company transfers, or cedes, a portion of its premiums to reinsurers and, in return, the reinsurer must share an agreed upon portion of losses and pay a ceding commission to the Company. In a fronting agreement, the Company writes premium and then cedes the majority of the premium and risk in exchange for a fronting fee, which is the primary source of profit in the arrangement.

The following table shows ceded written premiums under fronting and quota share arrangements by line of business for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024

The Company recognizes ceded unearned premiums related to quota share agreements as an asset on its consolidated balance sheets. As of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, ceded unearned premiums totaled $
276.2
 million and $
265.8
 million, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by premium growth in lines subject to fronting agreements or quota shares.

In addition to reinsurance purchased from traditional reinsurers, the Company has historically incorporated collateralized protection from the insurance linked securities market via catastrophe bonds. During the 
first
 quarter of 
2021,
 the Company closed a $
400
 million 
144A
 catastrophe bond that became effective 
 June 1, 2021. 
The catastrophe bond was completed through Torrey Pines Re Pte. Ltd. (“Torrey Pines Re Pte.”). Torrey Pines Re Pte. is a special purpose reinsurance vehicle incorporated in Singapore that provides Palomar with indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through 
 June 1, 2024. 
During the 
second
 quarter of 
2022,
 the Company closed a $
275
 million 
144A
 catastrophe bond that became effective 
 June 1, 2022. 
This catastrophe bond was completed through Torrey Pines Re Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled special purpose insurer that provides indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through 
 June 1, 2025. 
During the 
second
 quarter of 
2023,
 the Company also closed a $
200
 million 
144A
 catastrophe bond that became effective 
 June 1, 2023. 
This catastrophe bond was also completed through Torrey Pines Re Ltd and provides indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through 
 June 1, 2026. 
During the 
second
 quarter of 
2024,
 the Company also closed a $
420
 million 
144A
 catastrophe bond which became effective 
 June 1, 2024. 
This catastrophe bond was also completed through Torrey Pines Re Ltd and provides indemnity-based reinsurance covering earthquake events through 
 June 1, 2027.

Written premiums ceded under these catastrophe bond agreements were $
55.3
 million, $
42.7
 million and $
28.3
 million for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and

The ceding of insurance does 
not
 legally discharge the Company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policy coverage, and therefore the Company will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. To minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurance insolvencies, the Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk.

To reduce credit exposure to reinsurance recoverable balances, the Company obtains acceptable forms of collateral from certain reinsurers that are 
not
 authorized as reinsurers under U.S. state insurance regulations. In addition, under the terms of its reinsurance contracts, the Company 
 may 
retain funds due from reinsurers as security for those recoverable balances. As of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the Company had retained $
27.9
 million and $
13.4
 million in funds from reinsurers, respectively. The Company is able to use the funds in the ordinary course of its business. The funds are held in cash and cash equivalents and investments with an offsetting liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

For the year ended 
 December 31, 2024
, reinsurance premiums ceded to the Company’s 
three
 largest reinsurers totaled $
125.9
 million, $
67.9
 million and $
61.7
 million, representing 
28.5
% of the total balance. For the year ended 
 December 31, 2023
, reinsurance premiums ceded to the Company’s 
three
 largest reinsurers totaled $
152.4
 million, $
65.9
 million and $
47.4
 million, representing 
36.3
% of the total balance. For the year ended 
 December 31, 2022
, reinsurance premiums ceded to the Company’s 
three
 largest reinsurers totaled $
24.7
 million, $
22.9
 million and $
18.4
 million, representing 
23.9
% of the total balance.

At 
 December 31, 2024
 reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses by the Company’s 
three
 largest reinsurers were $
137.0
 million, $
26.9
 million and $
24.4
 million representing 
47.7
% of the total balance. At 
 December 31, 2023
 reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses by the Company’s 
three
 largest reinsurers were $
69.5
 million, $
29.8
 million and $
25.5
 million representing 
45.7
% of the total balance. The Company seeks reinsurers that have an A.M. best rating of A− (excellent) or better or requires them to post collateral.

the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders which provides a revolving credit facility of up to $
100.0
 million (the “Revolving Loan”). The maturity of the facility is 
 December 8, 2026. 
The Revolving Loan 
 may 
be either a SOFR rate loan or a base rate loan, at the Company’s discretion. The Revolving Loan 
 may 
be prepaid in full or in part at any time with 
no
 prepayment premium and 
 may 
be reduced in full or in part at any time upon prior notice. Interest on the Revolving Loan accrues on each SOFR rate loan at the applicable SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 
1.75
% and on each base rate loan at the applicable Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus (ii) 
0.75
%. In addition, the Company paid a commitment fee of $
0.3
 million upon closing of the Credit Agreement and must pay an unused line fee of 
0.25
% per annum on any unborrowed amount under the Credit Agreement.

 ​

The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured with a negative pledge against all assets of Palomar and its subsidiaries as described in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, financial covenants, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions.

The financial covenants in the Credit agreement require the Company 
not
 to exceed a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum net worth at the end of each quarter. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are also required to maintain a minimum Risk Based Capital Ratio at the end of each year and must always maintain a minimum AM Best Financial Strength rating. As of 
 December 31, 2024

 ​

The Credit Agreement provides for events of default customary for revolving loans of this type, including but 
not
 limited to non-payment, breaches, or defaults in the performance of covenants, insolvency, bankruptcy and the occurrence of a material adverse effect on Palomar. During the existence of an event of default, all outstanding amounts of the Revolving Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus 
2.00
%.

 million and $
1.0
 million, respectively, of interest related to borrowings and amortization of fees associated with the credit agreement.

2019
 Equity Incentive Plan

On 
 April 
16,

2019,
 the Company’s 
2019
 Equity Incentive Plan (the 
“2019
 Plan”) became effective. The

% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding 
 December 
31,
 or an amount determined by the board of directors. 

Stock Options

Recipients of stock options can purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price equal to the stock’s fair market value on the grant date, determined by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. Stock options vest over a period between 
two
 and 
four
 years with between 
25
% and 
50
% vesting on the 
first
 anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vesting monthly over the remaining period, subject to continued service to the Company. Stock options expire

Performance Stock Units (
“
PSUs
”
)

 ​

The Company issues PSUs to employees with a combination of service, performance, and market conditions.

 ​

The majority of PSUs were issued via grants made to certain executives during 
2021.
 These PSUs are earned based on the achievement of stock price milestones. If the Company’s stock price reaches and remains at certain milestones for 
30
 days, the PSUs shall become earned units and will vest upon completion of a requisite service period of approximately 
five
 years from the date of grant. 

For other PSUs outstanding, vesting of PSUs requires a period of future service and the number of shares that vest depends on performance relative to predetermined targets of the Company’s Gross Written Premiums and Adjusted Return on Equity as set by the Compensation Committee. For PSU grants issued in years prior to 
2023,
 the PSU’s performance period was the fiscal year of the grant. For PSU grants issued in 
2023
 and after, the PSU’s performance period is primarily a 
three
-year period beginning with the grant date. At the end of the performance period, the actual results are measured against the predetermined targets to determine the number of PSUs to be earned as compensation. The earned PSUs are then subject to a required service period of approximately 
three
 years from the grant date before vesting and being issued as common stock.

The following table summarizes PSU transactions for the year ended 
 December 31, 2024

The PSU grants above represent the number of shares that would vest based on achievement of all stock price milestones in the executive stock grants and the 
100
% achievement of the predetermined company performance conditions for the other PSU grants. The actual number of PSUs which will vest is subject to adjustment based on the Company’s actual stock price performance and financial performance relative to the predetermined targets and subject to recipient service requirements. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company had approximately $
9.4
 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to PSUs expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.7
 years.

2021
 Executive Stock Grants

 ​

During the year ended 
 December 31, 2021, 
the Company granted 
192,307
 RSUs and 
350,000
 PSUs to various executives, including the Company’s CEO. The RSUs vest over a period of 
five
 years with 
one

fifth
 vesting upon the first, 
second
 and 
third
 anniversary of the grants and the remainder vesting quarterly thereafter.

 ​

The PSUs are earned based on the achievement of stock price milestones. If the Company’s stock price reaches and remains at certain milestones for 
30
 days, the PSUs shall become earned units and will vest upon completion of a requisite service period. The Company’s CEO must remain as an employee through 
 December 31, 2025, 
or as an employee and/or director through the 
fifth
 anniversary of the grant date the PSUs to vest. Other executives must remain as employees through 
 December 31, 2026 
for the PSUs to vest. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, 
28,125
 PSU shares have become earned units and will vest upon completion of the requisite service period.

The above valuation allowance relates to state net operating losses ("NOL") carryforwards. Due to the limited carryforward period these do 
not
 meet the “more likely than 
not”
 criteria and it is necessary to maintain a valuation allowance on these items. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is 
no
 longer present.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, there is 
no

Table of Contents

As of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the Company had 
no
 uncertain tax positions that required either recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. This is 
not
 expected to change significantly during the next 
twelve
 months. The Company classifies interest and penalties, if any, related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company’s federal income tax returns for 
2021
 through 
2023
 and state income tax returns for 
2020
 through 
2023
 remain subject to examination by the tax authorities. The 
2024
 income tax return is expected to be filed in 
2025
 and is subject to examination when filed.

Under Pillar Two/GloBE rules, certain countries have agreed to enact a jurisdictional-level minimum tax system with a minimum effective tax rate (ETR) of 
15%.
 The Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 
2023
 also established a 
15%
 income tax regime. Companies with annual revenue above 
750
 million Euros will be within the scope of Pillar Two and the Bermuda CIT. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
Palomar is 
not
 within this revenue threshold and hence 
not
 an in-scope entity. Subsequent financial years will be assessed for these rules.

 Statutory financial information

U.S.

U.S. state insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory net income and capital and surplus for insurance companies. In addition, state regulators 
 may 
permit statutory accounting practices that differ from prescribed practices. Statutory accounting practices (“SAP”) prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities for the Company’s insurance subsidiaries differ from U.S. GAAP. The principal differences between SAP and GAAP as they relate to the financial statements of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are (a) policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred under SAP, whereas they are deferred and amortized under GAAP, (b) certain assets are 
not
 admitted for purposes of determining surplus under SAP, (c) investments in fixed income securities are carried at fair value under GAAP whereas such securities are carried at amortized cost under SAP, and (d) the criteria for recognizing net DTAs and the methodologies used to determine such amounts are different under SAP and GAAP.

Combined statutory net income and statutory capital surplus for the U.S. insurance subsidiaries, PSIC and PESIC as of 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
 and for the years then ended are summarized as follows:

Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) requirements promulgated by the NAIC require property/casualty insurers to maintain minimum capitalization levels determined based on formulas incorporating various business risks of the insurance subsidiaries. As of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the company’s capital and surplus exceeds its authorized control level.

Bermuda

Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, 
1978
 and related regulations, PSRE is required to maintain certain solvency and liquidity levels. The minimum statutory solvency margin required at 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
 was approximately $
1.2
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively. Actual statutory capital and surplus at 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
 was $
17.0
 million and $
16.1
 million, respectively. PSRE had statutory net income of $
0.4
 million, 
$0.3
 million and 
$0.2
 million for 
2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
, respectively.

PSRE had stockholders’ equity of $
16.9
 million and $
16.3
 million on a GAAP basis at 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, respectively. The principal difference between statutory capital and surplus and stockholders’ equity presented in accordance with GAAP is related to the valuation of investments. 
No
 dividends were paid in 
2024
 and 
2023
.

PSRE maintains a Class 
3A
 license and thus must maintain a minimum liquidity ratio in which the value of its relevant assets is 
not
 less than 
75.0
% of the amount of its relevant liabilities for general business. Relevant assets include cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturity securities, accrued interest income, premiums receivable, losses recoverable from reinsurers, and funds withheld. The relevant liabilities include total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities, less sundry liabilities. As of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the Company met the minimum liquidity ratio requirement.

19.
 Dividend Restrictions

U.S.

The Company’s U.S. insurance company subsidiaries, PSIC and PESIC are restricted by the statutes as to the amount of dividends that they 
 may 
pay without prior approval by state insurance commissioners.

Under California and Oregon statute which govern PSIC, dividends paid in a consecutive 
twelve
 month period cannot exceed the greater of (i) 
10%
 of an insurance company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of 
 December 
31
 of the preceding year or (ii) 
100%
 of its statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. Any dividends or distributions in excess of these amounts would require regulatory approval. In addition, under Oregon statute, PSIC 
 may 
only declare a dividend from earned surplus, which does 
not
 include contributed capital. Surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets is 
not
 considered part of earned surplus. Based on the above restrictions, PSIC 
 may 
pay a dividend or distribution of 
no
 greater than 
$99.6
 million in 
2025
 without approval by the California and Oregon Insurance Commissioners. During 
 October 2024, 
PSIC elected to pay a dividend of $
95.0
 million to its parent company.

Under Arizona statute which governs PESIC, dividends paid in a consecutive 
twelve
 month period cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 
10%
 of an insurance company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of 
 December 
31
 of the preceding year or (ii) 
100%
 of its statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. Based on the above restrictions, PESIC 
 may 
pay a dividend or distribution of 
no
 greater than 
$4.2
 million in 
2025
 without approval of the Arizona Insurance Commissioner.

In addition to the above limitations, any dividend or distribution declared is also subject to state regulatory approval prior to payment. In the future, state insurance regulatory authorities 
 may 
adopt statutory provisions and dividend limitations more restrictive than those currently in effect.

Table of Contents

Bermuda

Bermuda regulations limit the amount of dividends and return of capital paid by a regulated entity. A Class 
3A
 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin, its enhanced capital requirement, or its minimum liquidity ratio, or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach, or if there are reasonable grounds for believing there has been such a breach. Pursuant to Bermuda regulations, the maximum amount of dividends and return of capital available to be paid by a reinsurer is determined pursuant to a formula. Under this formula, the maximum amount of dividends and return of capital available to the Company from PSRE during 
2024
 is calculated to be approximately 
$4.2
 million. However, this dividend amount is subject to annual enhanced solvency requirement calculations.

20.
 Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is subject to legal proceedings arising from the normal conduct of its business. In the opinion of management, any ultimate liability that 
 may 
arise from these proceedings will 
not
 have a material effect on the Company’s financial position.

Letters of Credit and Trusts

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company has 
three
 irrevocable standby letters of credit for the benefit of ceding insurance companies to secure the unearned premium assumed by PSIC. The bank letters of credit amount to a total of $
5.6
 million and 
 may 
renew if the Company continues to assume premium from these insurance companies. The letters of credit are collateralized by the Company’s Credit Agreement.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company has a Letter of Credit for the benefit of the State of California to secured unearned premium and loss reserves incurred in the Worker’s Compensation program. The letter of credit amounts to 
$75
 million and are collateralized by the Company’s available-for-sale investments.

 ​In addition, the Company has established 
six
 Regulation 
114
 Trust accounts for the benefit of ceding insurance companies to secure the unearned premium assumed by PSIC. As of 
 December 31, 2024
 the trust had a market value of $
7.9
 million.

 Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs")

 Laulima Insurance Exchange, a Hawaii domiciled reciprocal exchange (“Laulima”) is a consolidated VIE. Laulima was formed in 
2023
 as an insurance carrier organized as an unincorporated association.

The Company's PUEO entity manages the business operations of Laulima and receives a management fee for the services provided to Laulima. Upon formation of Laulima, PSIC provided capital of

 $
15.0
 million in the form of a contribution to the surplus note issued by Laulima, which remains outstanding as of 
 December 31, 2024
. The Company holds an interest in the form of this surplus note which is included in other liabilities on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities of Laulima. In addition, the Company provides quota share reinsurance on the property business of Laulima. The Company has determined that is has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Laulima and, as it has provided capital to Laulima, would absorb any expected losses which could be significant to Laulima. As such, the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary and consolidates the results of Laulima. 

The Company does 
not
 own the equity of Laulima, which is owned by the policyholders. In the event of dissolution, policyholders would share any residual unassigned surplus but are 
not
 subject to assessment for any deficit in unassigned surplus of Laulima. The assets of Laulima can be used only to settle the obligations of Laulima and general creditors have 
no
 recourse to the Company.

The results of operations of Laulima are included in the Company’s consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income and Laulima generated $
0.1
 million of net loss in 
2024
 and $
0.6
 million of net loss in 
2023.
 As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
Laulima's assets totaled $
51.0
 million, primarily comprised of $
18.5
 million of cash and investments and $
30.5
 million of prepaid reinsurance premiums and are included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. For the same year, Laulima's liabilities totaled $
48.9
 million and primarily include $
30.5
 million of unearned premiums and $
15.0
 million of surplus notes. As of 
 December 31, 2023, 
Laulima's assets totaled 
$16.4
 million, primarily comprised of $
15.1
 million of cash and investments, and are included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  For the same year, Laulima's liabilities totaled $
16.9
 million and primarily include $
15.0
 million of surplus notes. The surplus notes are payable to PSIC and eliminate in consolidation for all years presented.

On 
 January 1, 2025,

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

 ​

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 ​

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

 ​

Management
’
s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 ​

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

 ​

(i)    Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

(ii)    Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

(iii)    Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 ​

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors.

 ​

Based on that assessment under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is included above.
