# Hidden_Gems

An AI model that finds undervalued companies in the NASDAQ 500. We can determine key metrics for success for different industries (like stock data, industry tailwinds, market conditions, and news/political context), and compare that with current ratings or indicators of success, like stock prices. If time permits, we could create a dashboard web app, where users can input companies of their choice to determine their evaluation.
