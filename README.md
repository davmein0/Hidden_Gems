# Hidden_Gems

An AI model that finds undervalued companies in the NASDAQ 500. We can determine key metrics for success for different industries (like stock data, industry tailwinds, market conditions, and news/political context), and compare that with current ratings or indicators of success, like stock prices. If time permits, we could create a dashboard web app, where users can input companies of their choice to determine their evaluation.

The MVP consists of an web app that lets users select stocks in the NASDAQ stock exchange, and evaluates how undervalued the stock is. The web app relies on a pretrained XGBoost model, and we plan to add sentiment analysis and a high-level reasoning overview for each decision, if time allows.

To run the frontend server, enter into the terminal:
cd hidden-gems-frontend
npm -install
npm run dev

To run the backend server, run:
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

# Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux or Mac

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000

## XGBoost Fundamental Analysis Model

### Overview & Limitations

This XGBoost classification model serves as the **fundamental analysis foundation** for our stock prediction system. It analyzes 8 key financial metrics (P/E, P/B, ROE, FCF Yield, etc.) to identify potentially undervalued mid-cap stocks.

**Important**: This model achieves **45% precision** on its own, which may seem low but is actually reasonable for fundamental-only stock prediction. Stock prices are driven by many factors beyond fundamentals—sentiment, momentum, news catalysts, and market psychology all play major roles that financial ratios cannot capture. Professional quant funds with far more resources typically achieve 55-65% precision on similar tasks.

### Current Performance

- **ROC AUC**: 0.627 (meaningfully better than random)
- **Training Data**: 505 ticker-year combinations (2020-2024)
- **Calibration**: High-confidence picks (>0.7 probability) have a 47% success rate vs. 21% for low-confidence picks

The model excels at **ranking** stocks by fundamental quality but struggles to predict actual price movements on its own.

### Why This is a Foundation, Not the Final Product

This model is designed to work alongside **FinBERT sentiment analysis**:

- **XGBoost**: Identifies fundamentally cheap, quality stocks
- **FinBERT** (to be added): Detects positive sentiment and catalysts
- **Combined**: Filters out "value traps" (cheap for a reason) and finds true opportunities

By combining fundamental scores with sentiment analysis, we expect to push precision from 45% to **60-70%**, similar to professional quantitative strategies.

### Key Takeaway

Think of this as the "quality filter" that identifies financially sound, undervalued companies. The sentiment layer will then help us determine _when_ the market is ready to recognize that value.

## Developer Quick Start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Set environment variables (see `.env.sample`)
4. Run the scraper

```powershell
python -m scripts.run_scrape --date 2025-11-28 --limit 100
```

5. Run training

```powershell
python -m scripts.run_train
```

For other developer tasks, see `pyproject.toml` and `scripts/`.

## Data layout (relative paths)

The project stores datasets and artifacts under a unified `data/` folder at the repo root:

- `data/raw/` - raw CSVs, intermediate outputs from scrapers (e.g., `midcaps_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, `financials_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, `filings_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`).
- `data/interim/` - merged/intermediate datasets generated by the pipeline (e.g., `merged_dataset_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`).
- `data/processed/` - final processed datasets for ML or UI (e.g., `merged_combined.csv`, `labeled_from_merged.csv`).
- `models/` - serialized models saved by training, e.g. `xgb_undervalued.pkl`.

Files are written by the pipeline using relative `data/` paths (via `hidden_gems.io` helpers). Use `scripts` wrappers or the package entrypoints to run operations and avoid writing to the repo root inadvertently.

Examples:

```powershell
# Scrape using data/raw as destination
python scripts\run_scrape.py --date 2025-11-28 --limit 100

# Use the pre-existing CSV under data/processed for training
python scripts\run_train.py --dataset data\processed\labeled_from_merged.csv --model-path models\xgb_undervalued.pkl
```
